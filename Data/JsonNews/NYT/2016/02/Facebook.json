Hillary Clinton, though, has a significant lead on Mr. Sanders among black voters, who have known and supported her and former President Bill Clinton for years.Mr. Sanders significantly trails Mrs. Clinton in big national union endorsements. He has picked up a few endorsements while Mrs. Clinton has been endorsed by more than 20 labor groups. Endorsements by unions in Nevada could prove critical as the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working-class voters go to caucus.The electrical workers\u2019 union is now working to register all of its 4,000 members to vote and is encouraging them to caucus for Mr. Sanders, said Al Davis, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business manager and financial secretary.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementFebruary  4, 2016Andrew C. McCarthyStephen I. VladeckBefore we rush to judgment on whether Secretary Clinton\u2019s email practices broke the law, it is worth highlighting two features of contemporary classification law that may seem counterintuitive \u2014 but that underscore why her conduct may well have been careless, but likely wasn\u2019t criminal.It is, therefore, inevitable that mistakes will be made by even the most well-intentioned senior government officers \u2014 mistakes that federal criminal law was never meant to punish. Secretary Clinton may well still deserve criticism for entrusting such sensitive matters to a private server, but there is a world of difference between criticism and criminal charges.\nIt is always dicey to make legal judgments based on press reports rather than an examination of concrete evidence. That said, Hillary Clinton could be in legal jeopardy for what appears to be mishandling of classified information by means of the private email system she improperly established for the conduct of her government business as secretary of state. Three factors support this conclusion. First, statements made by government officials, coupled with the state department\u2019s redaction of hundreds of private emails, indicate that classified information was improperly communicated via the private email system. Recently, we learned that 22 emails contain such closely guarded secrets \u2014 potentially involving sensitive methods and sources of intelligence gathering \u2014 that no parts of those emails can be publicly disclosed without damaging national security.Second, Secretary Clinton\u2019s public statements have shifted markedly. Initially, she maintained that no classified information had been communicated through her private system. This claim became untenable with the revelation that hundreds of her emails contained classified information (the current count exceeds 1,500). So Secretary Clinton adopted the similarly unsustainable position that this became classified only after she received it. Now, faced with the undeniable fact that much of the information was \u201cborn classified,\u201d she claims that it was not \u201cmarked\u201d classified, and that any mishandling may be the fault of underlings. These attempts to suggest she was unaware of any wrongdoing are likely unavailing. That is due to the third factor: The laws against mishandling classified information are prosecution-friendly. For example, it is a felony for one entrusted with classified information not only to communicate it to a person unauthorized to have it, but also to enable its removal from its secure storage facility through gross negligence. It is also a crime to fail to report that information\u2019s improper removal or communication. So is retaining materials containing classified information at an unauthorized location. Secretary Clinton systematically conducted official business on a private unsecure system, and had subordinates do likewise, knowing the nature of their duties made classified communications inevitable. Like others with access to classified information, she signed a nondisclosure acknowledging that that this information could include \u201cunmarked\u201d documents and \u201coral communications.\u201d At least one email finds her instructing a subordinate to remove classified markings and send a document to her via the nonsecure channel (though it is publicly unknown whether the subordinate complied). She is obviously responsible for any foreseeable wrongs committed by her subordinates using a system she set up. And she transferred the classified information on the servers to a private maintenance company and to lawyers not authorized to have it.\nDespite rightly noting that it is dicey to make legal judgments based on press reports, Andy does just that, concluding that, based on her conduct and public statements, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, \u201ctransferred the classified information\" on State Department servers \"to a private maintenance company and to lawyers not authorized to have it,\u201d and thereby likely committed a felony.In this day and age, it is easy to rush to judgment, especially against an individual to whose politics one objects. But if there is a real culprit here, it appears to be our labyrinthine, overbroad and preposterously unaccountable classification system, and not Secretary Clinton\u2019s emailing habits. Absent evidence of far more nefarious conduct, her enemies will have to beat her the old-fashioned way \u2014 at the ballot box.\nWhat is \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d in Steve's comments is not classification practice but the suggestion that a criminal investigation is a \u201crush to judgment.\u201d The commencement of a criminal investigation \u2014 in this unusual instance, the evolution of such an ongoing investigation from an elongated preliminary F.B.I. probe to the opening of a grand jury inquiry \u2014 would not be a judgment that Secretary Clinton has violated the law. It would be an acknowledgment of the obvious: There is conduct worth investigating.There is no gainsaying that classification is dynamic and that the government classifies too much information. These unremarkable facts might be relevant if we were dealing with a small number of classified documents. To the contrary, here we are confronted with what may ultimately amount to thousands of emails containing classified information \u2014 some of which was \u201cborn classified\u201d in the sense that it was derived from categories of material presumptively classified when generated; some of which was patently classified because it reportedly implicated special access programs, which are among the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets.The fact that classification can sometimes be dynamic \u2014 in other words, that public domain information occasionally becomes classified, and what is declassified sometimes gets reclassified \u2014 could plausibly be a defense in connection with some of Secretary Clinton\u2019s communications. That this could be the situation with respect to all of the hundreds of communications at issue is inconceivable. Given what we know so far about Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal emails, was her behavior criminal? "}
{"Headline": "Twitter, to Save Itself, Must Scale Back World-Swallowing Ambitions", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTwitter is the world\u2019s most important social network.Wall Street has only one template of success for an Internet company: Google and, later, Facebook. By filing for an initial public offering, Twitter was telling the world that it was part of the same club \u2014 that there was no upper bound to its business aims, and that it would try to build a money machine that matched the size and importance of its service.But what if the best path for Twitter, as a service, is for Twitter the company to abandon that dream? What if becoming a $25 billion, $50 billion or $100 billion world-swallowing Internet giant just isn\u2019t in the cards for a niche service like Twitter?Perhaps there\u2019s more promise in a future as an independent but private company; as a small and sustainable division of some larger tech or media conglomerate; or even as a venture that operates more like a nonprofit foundation.Even if Twitter intends to remain a public corporation \u2014 because there does not seem to be much appetite, nor a very obvious mechanism, for investors to take it private \u2014 it\u2019s time for Mr. Dorsey to reset expectations for what his company can become. Twitter should think of itself and portray itself to investors as more of a public utility than as a business that never stops growing, and that could ever hope to approach the market value of Facebook.This does not mean that Twitter should abandon making money. Twitter can still run a fine business that generates enough to maintain and improve the reach of the service. But every Internet company doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest, boldest, always-growing entity we are conditioned to expect.Instead of aiming for something like Facebook, Twitter could mold itself on some other template for success. It could become a venture like Wikipedia, run by a nonprofit that depends on donations, or a business like The New York Times Company, a publicly traded enterprise controlled by a family that has a preference for journalistic ambition.In other words, Twitter should make clear that there are limits to the scope of its business ambitions, and that it is guided by a philosophical bias for the health of the service over an ambition to grow at any cost.There\u2019s a simple reason for Mr. Dorsey to consider some other path: Implausible expectations are a setup for a bleak future. After losing its dominance as a search engine, Yahoo has faced more than a decade of struggle mainly because it has tried too long to become the one-stop portal that it isn\u2019t.In that effort it has squandered talent and money and run through more chief executives than you\u2019d find at a Brooks Brothers sale. If, instead of pursuing the moon, Yahoo had vastly lowered its ambitions and planned to do one or two things really well, it could have found a sustainable path forward.Clarifying Twitter\u2019s mission would be painful for the people who work at the company. There could be more layoffs and a plummeting of the equity they hold in the company if it were to go private. It would also be painful for investors who bought in to the company expecting it to be the next big thing.But limiting Twitter\u2019s scope would almost certainly be better for the service. Twitter needs to improve its product: It should have better ways of addressing abuse and harassment, and it should be easier for users to find tweets about topics that interest them. But it isn\u2019t clear that the solutions to these problems are found in growth.Mr. Dash pointed out that making Twitter easier for new people to join could in fact worsen the problems of harassment. \u201cThe discussion is always about reducing friction to joining,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one of the things that might drive better behavior might be to increase friction \u2014 to make it harder to sign up. But nobody\u2019s having that discussion.\u201dSetting a cap on Twitter\u2019s business scope could also tame some of the overreactions that occur whenever the company tries to make reasonable improvements to its service.This week, in anticipation of what turned out to be a modest feature that recommends interesting tweets to people, thousands of users on the service lost their minds predicting that Twitter as we know it was soon to be dead.I suspect they are leery because they see a company being pushed to change by Wall Street, for reasons that aren\u2019t exactly obvious to the people who now love and value Twitter as it is. They see their favorite band straining to become U2. And they hate U2.Twitter, as it is right now, is mostly pretty good for lots and lots of people. Facebook has five times as many users, Instagram is as luxurious as a European vacation, and Snapchat is too cool for school. But because Twitter is an accessible, real-time network that has become the nerve center of the world\u2019s journalists, politicians, activists and agitants, it has, for better or worse, demonstrated an unrivaled capacity to influence real things in the real world.\u201cTwitter has created space for the amplification of the voice of marginalized people in ways that we have not seen before,\u201d said DeRay McKesson, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cIt has redefined our understanding of the public sphere to be more inclusive and more accessible and to have substantive impact on real-world events.\u201dOf course, Twitter could be better. But it does not need a wholesale overhaul just for the sake of fueling growth.\u201cTwitter maybe hasn\u2019t evolved the product to the point that Wall Street analysts might like, but the utility that Twitter has for providing real-time news is real, and it hasn\u2019t really been disrupted by anyone else,\u201d said Mike Jones, the chief executive of a start-up incubator named Science Media.Mr. Jones used to be the chief executive of Myspace, the once-giant social network, but he rejected any comparison between Twitter and that now vastly diminished network.\u201cFor me and for lots of people, Twitter has actual utility to it, and for those people, that\u2019s what will keep it around,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Increasingly, food is the hook.So you may see quail, elk or trout as choices, or shrimp-and-grits and custom-flavored liquid nitrogen ice cream. Or perhaps there will be a bacon bar.\u201cBecause millennials have been to so many weddings, there\u2019s a push to dazzle guests in ways they haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Harmony Walton, who owns the Bridal Bar, a wedding planning concierge service in Los Angeles.\u201cFirst it was with d\u00e9cor and design, now it\u2019s food,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have a broader palate at a younger age, and they\u2019ve gained acquired tastes. They care about what they\u2019re serving. They want higher quality. But they also want customization.\u201dThe abundance of Food Network and cuisine-focused reality TV shows, as well as Instagram and Pinterest posts, may be partly responsible for this gastronomic upswing. It also helps that ordering food from anywhere in the world is a click away.\u201cOnline ordering has made things that were previously inaccessible available to everyone,\u201d said Anthony Dominguez, the executive chef at the Acqualina Resort and Spa in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla. \u201cUnheard-of ingredients or exotic foods like white truffles from Paris or slipper lobsters from Indonesia, both of which I got for clients, were flown to us overnight.\u201dMost important these days, he said, is \u201cquality, freshness and availability.\u201d Because so many unusual ingredients are available online, chefs can be more creative or experiment with foods they have not worked with before.Where food was once an afterthought, \u201cit\u2019s become a far more important part of the wedding,\u201d said Alex M. Susskind, an associate professor of food and beverage management at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. \u201cNow weddings are more about what you\u2019re serving as opposed to where you\u2019re having it.\u201dRandal Jacobs is the executive chef at the Chicago catering company Blue Plate, which does about 180 weddings a year. Five years ago, chefs were not as daring in executing and creating unusual dishes, he said.\u201cBut because there\u2019s a higher level of expectation, amazing chefs are moving away from the restaurant scene and filtering into catering companies with the understanding that there\u2019s more opportunity for innovation,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said.Recently he served 200 deboned quails. He placed them in terrine molds, which were cooked sous-vide and then wrapped in pancetta. Chips were made from the birds\u2019 skin. \u201cIt was a huge hit,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople scratched their heads and said, \u2018Wow, what\u2019s this?\u2019\u201dLast Labor Day weekend, Jessica Smagner, 31, and Jared Vestal, 32, invited 100 guests to their wedding in Chicago. \u201cFood is our hobby and what we really care about,\u201d said Ms. Vestal, a digital marketer. \u201cIt determines where we travel. Because we\u2019re foodies, our guests knew the cuisine was going to be the main focus.\u201dMost items were relevant to their relationship. Their trip to Thailand was highlighted with bite-size crab cakes flavored with lemongrass and topped with sweet chile r\u00e9moulade and Thai basil. There were also crisp French fries topped with a cheeseburger slider and served with garbage-plate meat sauce from the Nick Tahou Hots restaurant in Rochester; it\u2019s a dish the couple ate when they first met in college.Other offerings: sweet corn waffles with roasted pork mole, poblano cream and pickled corn; and a spinach salad skewer with endive and bacon lardons dressed with truffle cream. Rather than a cake, they opted for doughnuts from their favorite Chicago spot, the Doughnut Vault.\u201cThe meal surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations,\u201d said Ms. Vestal, who said her menu took a year to plan. \u201cFood is just as important as the couple getting married.\u201dAnother way to enhance the more traditional fare is to serve cuisine indigenous to a particular region.\u201cNew Orleans weddings are seafood heavy because of where we are and the type of food we\u2019re known for: shrimp-and-grits, gumbo, pan-seared jumbo sea scallops, and sweet potato and barbecue shrimp tart,\u201d said Ashley Wright, the catering sales manager at the Windsor Court Hotel in that city. \u201cBrides want trendier options rather than a beef carving station, which has dwindled in popularity over the years.\u201dThe Park Hyatt Beaver Creek in Colorado, which held more than 60 weddings in 2015, always incorporates indigenous ingredients.\u201cToday\u2019s menu reflects 75 percent elk, Colorado lamb or trout,\u201d said Tom Puntel, the hotel\u2019s director of sales and marketing. \u201cPeople want to offer their guests something you can\u2019t get anywhere else.\u201dFor others, it isn\u2019t so much about where you are but who you are. When Samantha Lisi, now 25, a prekindergarten teacher, married Benjamin Willis, 25, a law school student, on June 28, 2014, their wedding, at his grandmother\u2019s house on a former plantation in Virginia, was a mix of her Italian upbringing and his deep Southern roots.\u201cFood is really important to both of us, but we come from extremely different backgrounds,\u201d Ms. Willis said. \u201cMy husband is from Suffolk, Va., and I\u2019m from a loud Italian family from New York. We wanted a way to marry the foods as we were marrying each other. One of the best ways to show that new unity for us was blending the food together.\u201d\u201cBoth sides of the family felt included because of what we served,\u201d Ms. Willis said. \u201cIt was very nontraditional, but it really worked.\u201dThe make-it-yourself movement has also given couples a way to customize their meal. Interactive stations can encompass a bacon bar, slider station or burrata stand, where chefs make Italian cheese by hand. Or guests may have a choice of garnishes, like a lavender sprig or berries, to add to their glasses of Champagne.\u201cIt allows everyone to participate in an experience while creating a memory,\u201d said Ms. Walton of the Bridal Bar. \u201cCustomization and personalization are two things this generation\u2019s couples want to give their guests, while taking everyone\u2019s dietary considerations and food allergies into account.\u201dAnd for dessert? Designing your own cupcakes or making your own ice cream are possibilities. Acqualina makes liquid nitrogen ice cream at stations where people can create flavors such as coffee, Jolly Rancher, cotton candy or marshmallow while adding any toppings they want, Mr. Dominguez said.\u201cA few years ago, this concept was a science experiment,\u201d the chef said. \u201cNow we use it in weddings. It\u2019s the tasty, interactive and memorable component that matters so much at these events.\u201dSome couples are including a menu with the R.S.V.P. card. The more exotic or interesting it is, the better chance a guest will attend, Mr. Dominguez said.\u201cDishes you\u2019ve not experienced before persuade people to go if they\u2019re on the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt swings people into saying, \u2018Maybe we should make time for this.\u2019 You\u2019ll remember the truffle-dusted sea scallops over risotto more than you\u2019ll remember the vows that were exchanged.\u201dDr. Susskind of Cornell agreed. \u201cA wedding is an extension of you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food is an expression of who you are. If you serve a slab of prime rib and scoop of mashed potatoes, that says something. If you\u2019re only offering average grub, you\u2019ll disappear.\u201dAnd guests aren\u2019t likely to forget the couple who served quail chips.A Gift?

Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201dHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201dIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

But it was the latest reported sighting of a stranded sea lion in California, where the mammals are increasingly being found on land in places they were never meant to be, partly because of changing weather conditions driving them ashore.A sea lion wandered into La Jolla\u2019s Cave Store, a souvenir shop, last month. An employee said she lured it outside with salmon.In the first five months of 2015, there were 3,340 young sea lions found stranded, compared with 862 in the same period in 2014 and 1,262 in 2013, the agency said.El Ni\u00f1o, the weather condition that causes temperatures in the Pacific Ocean to become unusually warm, is believed to be a reason behind the increased strandings because of its impact on the food supply web, according to the oceanic group. It can also generate algal blooms and infectious disease outbreaks.About 8 a.m. Thursday, Leslie Tovar, a manager for the Shores Restaurant, another of the club\u2019s restaurants, was on the grounds when she got a call from a custodian at the Marine who was \u201cvacuuming up the floor and happened to come across a baby sea lion that matched the interior very well.\u201d\u201cHe said there was a sea lion in the dining room,\u201d Ms. Tovar said in a telephone interview Friday. \u201cBooth 65.

But the staff suspects it went through a back door that the cleaner had propped open to take in equipment at 6 a.m.Ms. Tovar called SeaWorld, which sent a team with a net and roused it from sleep. The team identified it as female, about 8 months old and weighing about 20 pounds \u2014 about half the weight it should be at that age.\u201cIt was also a little bit shocking to see how small the pup was,\u201d said Jody Westberg, one of SeaWorld\u2019s animal coordinators, who went to the rescue.\u201cA micro-pup.

Besides the obvious benefit of temporarily trading New York\u2019s dreary February weather for that of warm and sunny Southern California, I also enjoy getting a little out of my comfort zone to work on the entertainment calendar\u2019s biggest night of the year.My job at the Oscars is to build the fiber-optic network that connects our camera positions at the ceremony to a nearby workroom that receives every picture our photographers take. From there, the photos are compressed and sent back to The Times\u2019s office in New York, where a team of editors select, caption and publish \u2014 in as close to real time as possible \u2014 our team\u2019s best photographs.The team here in Los Angeles spends the week before the Academy Awards setting up and testing our equipment \u2014 and then testing it again and again. We consider the angles, the light, the weather; we plan for myriad contingencies by carrying backups for every piece of hardware. In short, we do everything we can to position ourselves to capture the most glamorous looks on the carpet and every crucial moment of the show.We also spend the week lining up our clothes for the evening. (Because of our proximity to the guests, all journalists are required to don formal wear: either a tuxedo or a formal-length gown. The Academy reserves the right to turn away anyone whose dress does not meet its standards.)On Oscar day, we run a final round of tests on our gear and our transmission lines. Later, all of the journalists are removed from the theater for a massive security sweep, returning just before the first celebrities arrive on the red carpet.Noel photographs the stars on the red carpet from a chaotic on-site press pen that\u2019s remarkably hot and loud. (He likens the experience to that of a canned sardine trying to take pictures.) At the same time, Monica \u2014 who is one of the few news photographers allowed onto the red carpet \u2014 wanders among the celebrities, capturing up-close and candid moments. As the show begins, Patrick takes his position at the back of the theater; Monica moves backstage to cover the show from the side of the stage and capture moments you won\u2019t see on television.While all of this is happening, I monitor our operation and troubleshoot any issues that may arise, then edit and build a slide show for the Governor\u2019s Ball. It\u2019s a long night that caps off a long week. After staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning, I hop on a flight to New York around 11 a.m. and am back on the international desk the next morning.But it isn\u2019t just about the numbers. We also edited and published our photos more quickly than just about any other news organization.I\u2019m already thinking about how we might do things better \u2014 and faster \u2014 next year.Advertisement"}

When she met the residents of Duquesne Court, in Springdale, they told her stories about who had gotten cancer and whose children died young. But she also understood such things could come to seem normal to the residents, for whom moving away was simply not a practical option.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I would say to everyone in Duquesne Court: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what do you think about those stacks? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right there at the end of your street.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They would look up and say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh. Stacks. Right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so much a part of the community that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even see them anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Johnson said.It all began almost 10 years ago, when Brian Cohen, an English art historian and photographer, moved his family to the area, after visiting friends there on a beautiful day. When asked if he felt lured under false pretenses, he insisted he loves the city, while admitting, with dry English wit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPittsburgh is not known as the sunniest city in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen was inspired to act in 2010, when his wife, Ilyssa Manspeizer, suggested he seek funding for a project about fracking. His proposal to a local foundation was not successful, but the funding was ultimately found elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought about that for a second,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a really good idea. It quickly occurred to me that this is a big, big story. Much bigger than someone like myself could tackle alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought, why not propose a project where a whole group of photographers get together, in the tradition of something like the F.S.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 the Farm Security Administration photography program begun during the Great Depression.He enlisted his colleague Laura Domencic, the director of the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, to help organize a six-photographer collective for the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project. The group, which also featured Noah Addis, Nina Berman, Scott Goldsmith, Martha Rial and Ms. Johnson, shot a project about fracking that has been exhibited regularly since 2012.Thrilled by its success, Mr. Cohen suggested another collaboration in 2014, to examine the poor air quality in his adopted city. He combined both endeavors in The Documentary Works, an umbrella organization with a website to archive and support projects focusing on issues affecting the area.For the new venture, Mr. Cohen re-enlisted Ms. Johnson and Mr. Goldsmith, and included Ms. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend Annie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill. The resulting exhibition and companion book are a pastiche of styles and narrative techniques, which was intentional, according to Ms. Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the past, we have the present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Johnson, a National Geographic fellow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have color and black-and-white. We have this smorgasbord of visual solutions that hopefully brings not just the people, but the issues to life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen photographed the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial infrastructure in color, and subtly manipulated the images to enhance the \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d of smoke rising into the sky. Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill used Polaroid Type 55 film to shoot portraits of survivors of a 1948 environmental disaster, in which local residents died because of polluted air trapped in the atmosphere, a condition known as inversion. Mr. Goldsmith shot black-and-white, documentary photographs of local miners organizing, patients in hospital beds, and a train derailment, among other subjects.Initially, Ms. Johnson used her iPhone to shoot mostly landscapes in Cheswick, but soon felt she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting the narrative depth she craved.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a photographer, you have to find a way, emotionally, into the story, into the subject matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening, so I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go close to the stacks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I went right to the base, and saw, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh my God, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a street, almost exactly opposite to the entry of this plant.\u2019\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite its lingering reputation, Pittsburgh is no longer the industrial hub it once was. Mr. Cohen notes that the economy has begun to roar again, this time because of what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cEds and Meds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They now have \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology, robotics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle is here. Facebook just opened up a center.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Johnson concurred, surprised to find her city had become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvital, youthful place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she has spent so much of her time on the road. While she agreed that the air quality had improved, she stressed that her group of collaborators was interested in creating dialogue and encouraging the community to stand up for itself. They see themselves as concerned citizens, trying to make a difference, something Ms. Johnson hopes to inspire in others, wherever they live.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook around you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she challenged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want to change?

It is in some ways evocative of the well-known \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad that ran against the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Masschusetts. That ad, which featured a black man who killed a white person after being released from prison under a Dukakis administration program, was overtly racial; the Trump ad does not mention the nationality or background of the man convicted in the 2008 killing. The testimonial from the elder Mr. Shaw softens what is otherwise a tough-on-crime, tough-on-illegal-immigration spot. And without a specific attack on another candidate or person, it diffuses a key element of what made the Horton spot famous.Regardless of how people view the politics of the immigration debate, the spot is certain to stand out amid a clutter of advertising on the South Carolina airwaves.Mr. Trump has been criticized by Hispanic groups and others since June, when in announcing his candidacy he said of Mexican immigrants: \u201cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing drugs. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing crime. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rapists.

{"Headline": "With This Tattoo, I Thee Wed", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byField NotesValentine\u2019s Day often finds couples speaking of love and lasting commitment. Some have concluded (for better or worse) that there is no finer way to celebrate eternal love than by showcasing it on one\u2019s ring finger with a tattoo.\u201cOnce you get it, there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d said Christopher Forsley, who was married last July to Sarah Patterson in Santa Monica, Calif. For Mr. Forsley, 30, a comic book writer, and Ms. Forsley, 28, a cake maker, the factors driving their decision to get inked came down to cost, minimalism and timing \u2014 oh, and the fact that Mr. Forsley\u2019s brother is a tattoo artist.\u201cWe\u2019re both broke and not materialistic,\u201d Mr. Forsley said. \u201cWe liked the idea that this wasn\u2019t an object, but rather something that was going to become a part of us.\u201dThe bride added, \u201cThis matched who we are.\u201dMike Martin, the owner of Flesh Skin Grafix Tattoo in Imperial Beach, Calif., said, \u201cI see maybe one couple a week, which is a lot considering five years ago almost no one was asking for them.\u201dGiven the permanence of tattoos, inked-on rings are generally for those who have recently been married rather than simply engaged. Surprising one\u2019s intended with an unexpected trip to a tattoo parlor, perhaps on one knee, may not go over as expected.Tattooed-on wedding rings come in an array of designs. Among the most popular are branding the wedding date, spouse\u2019s name or initials onto the finger. Some designs are simple; a monochrome squiggle line or the infinity symbol around the digit. Some favor words: \u201calways,\u201d \u201cforever\u201d or \u201ctogether.\u201dFor her marriage to Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9 had a Roman numeral inked onto her ring finger. Behati Prinsloo, who is married to Adam Levine, had three dots tattooed onto her ring finger.Others are intricate works of art, incorporating objects like arrows going off in different directions, a heart and key, or an outline of the state where the couple fell in love. Dax Shepard, who is married to Kristen Bell, has a bell-shaped tattoo inside of which are three initials: K, L and D, for Kristen, Dax, and their daughter Lincoln.Those who go for inked-on rings are often looking for a different kind of wedding experience to go along with them. \u201cI never wanted to have a traditional wedding,\u201d said Molly Serena Dorsman, 29, a music teacher in New Jersey, who married Dzermin Mesic, 32, a chef, in 2012.She contends that those who favor the traditional gold ring often get divorced. \u201cWe want to be married forever,\u201d she said, \u201cand this cements that.\u201dFor their ceremony, held in a courthouse in New Jersey, Ms. Dorsman and Mr. Mesic bought stand-in rings from a flea market. He got a basic silver band and she got a thick-banded ring with vintage roses on it, silver as well.A few days later, the couple visited her friend\u2019s store, Aqua Santa Tattoo, a parlor on West 18th Street in Manhattan, from which they each chose a simple band; she had a heart added to hers.In addition to \u201cincreasing the feeling of permanency of a couple\u2019s faith,\u201d said Myrna L. Armstrong, a retired professor from the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, a ring tattoo represents a \u201cdistinctive choice to have this done, and the understanding that no one else will have anything like theirs. These intense meanings are very appealing to couples.\u201d\u201cTattoos make people feel good, special and unique\u201d and are particularly appealing to millennials, said Ms. Armstrong, who has studied tattoos for 25 years. \u201cIt\u2019s become a common and comfortable means of providing a message to themselves and to others.\u201dAnthony Botiglione, 43, who is to marry Jennifer Fiorenza, 35, a publicist, on Feb. 28 in Baiting Hollow, N.Y., said, \u201cYou can\u2019t take it off, you can\u2019t lose it, you can\u2019t put it in your pocket, which some men do to show the world they\u2019re not married.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that guy,\u201d Mr. Botiglione said. \u201cI want to look at my hand and know this huge commitment I\u2019ve made is forever.\u201dBecause he\u2019s in construction, he cannot wear jewelry; he will get a simple black tattoo band when the couple return from their honeymoon in March. But she will stick with a traditional ultrathin rose-gold band with pav\u00e9 diamonds.Those seeking tattooed wedding rings, said Mr. Martin, want to step out on the edge a bit. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want to freak anyone out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s acceptable at work, and no one will fire them for it.\u201dGold wedding bands typically cost $300 to $700 each, according to a representative of the Jewelers of America trade association. Mr. Martin said his shop typically charges about $60 for a simple design that the couple brings in. If he is creating it, and there are a number of colors or it\u2019s a technical piece, it could be $100 or more.The latter price is what Mr. Forsley\u2019s brother said that he would have charged per ring to other clients. But for Mr. Forsley, the fact that the rings were free was not as important as \u201chaving my brother design and tattoo us. It was far better than going to a store and having a salesperson talk you into something.\u201dMs. Dorsman and Mr. Mesic recall paying the personal friend who inked their wedding bands about $50 each. That doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Mesic skipped over presenting her first with an engagement ring.\u201cMy husband did give me an engagement ring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a plastic one from 7-Eleven. I was pretty gung-ho on not wanting a ring.\u201dTattoos can cost less than traditional jewelry, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are cost-effective or long-lasting. Inked rings do fade with time. The skin on hands sheds more quickly because of constant use, and gets the most exposure to sun. To compensate, tattoo artists must inject the ink deeper than the customary two levels of the dermis.Last month, almost every chair in Kings Avenue Tattoo on the Bowery in Manhattan was filled, as Devin Ikram, 32, and his wife, Kayla, 31, sat on the padded black seats while Zac Scheinbaum fixed the triangle tattoo he had inked onto Devin\u2019s ring finger four months earlier, when the couple wed.Mr. Ikram, a graphic designer, had created the triangles after he spent two weeks researching symbolism, alchemy and elemental shapes. \u201cThese represent a dichotomy of polar opposites and the fitting together,\u201d he said while Mr. Scheinbaum re-inked his ring finger, a process that took only minutes. \u201cA triangle pointing up is masculine. One pointing down is feminine,\u201d he added.If a marriage does not work out, one can\u2019t simply tug off a tattooed ring. Among those who may now wish they hadn\u2019t gotten inked are Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who has an \u201cM\u201d \u2014 her second wife\u2019s first initial \u2014 tattooed on her ring finger, and Pamela Anderson, who had her \u201cTommy\u201d ring tattoo removed.\u201cIn the past two years, we\u2019ve been getting approximately one patient a month asking for the tattoo to be removed,\u201d said Dr. Roy G. Geronemus, director of the Laser and Skin Surgery Center of New York. \u201cPrior to that, I\u2019d not seen them at all.\u201dDr. Geronemus said women were more apt to appear in his waiting room, eager for the deletion. \u201cMore women come in, some are angry, some convey concern, some remorse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tattoo now is a constant reminder of a failed relationship. Women want it off and they want it off quickly so they can move on psychologically.\u201dThat is very expensive. The tattoo may have cost $50 to $150 and taken a short time to ink, but to make it vanish, Dr. Geronemus said, could take four to five office sessions, costing $400 per visit.Yet that hasn\u2019t deterred those seeking something different. And tattoo artists are welcoming couples with open, tattooed arms. \u201cTattoo artists tend to be very entrepreneurial,\u201d said Ms. Armstrong, the retired professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive world, and it seems quite logical that some would create tattoo wedding band packages where the couple comes in together to have them done either before or after their ceremony.\u201dMr. and Ms. Ikram left Kings Avenue Tattoo all smiles and kisses.\u201cWe own this,\u201d Mr. Ikram said, while looking at his newly re-inked finger. \u201cWe were part of this creation. Now that it\u2019s back to its original color, I feel much better. It didn\u2019t look like my wife\u2019s. Before, people couldn\u2019t tell what it was. Now I can show it off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweetheart, Get Me Readers", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byThe Public Editor\u201cA lot of people were too young to read our coverage then, or wanted to refresh their memories,\u201d Patrick LaForge, a senior editor here, told me.Mr. LaForge, who is both steeped in Times practices and digitally savvy (he is often credited with coining the Twitter truism, \u201cRetweets do not equal endorsements\u201d) directs the newsroom\u2019s Express Team. The group of eight writers and editors quickly develops articles when a topic begins gathering steam on social media.The team also jumps on breaking news, often rewriting other news sources (with credit where due) and adding original interviews and other research even as The Times\u2019s traditional news desks \u2014 national, business, metro or international \u2014 may still be evaluating whether an event merits dispatching a reporter.In many cases, this results in coverage that The Times in the old days (and by that, I mean three or four years ago) would not have spent staff time on, and may not have even considered giving space to.The team, Mr. LaForge said, is a response to a new reality: The Times can no longer just decide, high on its mountaintop, what is news. \u201cThe reader controls the news agenda much more than 30 years ago,\u201d he told me.One reader, Janice Ewing of Yonkers, wrote, \u201cThere is too much fluff and silliness in the so-called news.\u201dAnother, Brian Maniere of Brooklyn, expressed what many have told me. These stories, he wrote, are \u201cabundant on the web for free. I read the Times for information that matters.\u201d He had a plea for Times decision makers: \u201cPlease don\u2019t join in an ignoble race to the bottom in the pursuit of clicks.\u201dMr. LaForge rejects the idea that his team produces clickbait. \u201cClickbait is not a useful term\u201d here, he said. \u201cPeople use it when they think something is pandering or not truly newsworthy, in the same way people used to use the term \u2018tabloid,\u2019 or say of TV news, \u2018If it bleeds, it leads.\u2019 \u201dThat, he emphasized, is not his team\u2019s purpose, which is to be quickly responsive to a constantly changing \u2014 and global \u2014 online conversation.\u201cSome of our competitors base their business model purely on traffic,\u201d Mr. LaForge noted. The Times, on the other hand, primarily wants to get more readers to pay for digital subscriptions \u2014 an important revenue source now that print advertising revenue has withered. So it is crucial to bring new readers to The Times, where they can discover all kinds of journalism, including foreign coverage and investigative projects.Mr. LaForge said he was focused \u201con engagement, not page views.\u201d That includes how many readers share a story, or comment on it, or how long they spend on it, and whether they go on to read other Times stories.Dean Baquet, the executive editor, told me that the Express Team\u2019s primary purpose is journalistic: to make The Times an early part of what people are talking about and what they care about.\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous international conversation going on, and we need to capture it,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, there is no substitute for having reporters on the ground, but when a news story breaks, we can\u2019t wait to make the judgment about how consequential it is before we let readers know about it.\u201dMr. LaForge and Mr. Baquet admit occasional misjudgments. \u201cIt\u2019s new, and we sometimes stumble,\u201d Mr. Baquet said.I understand readers\u2019 unease. They wonder, justifiably, if some of these stories make the best use of limited resources, and they doubt whether they are worthy of attention in The New York Times. Occasionally, I can\u2019t help but agree: Some of this stuff has been cringe-worthy.But much of it makes a valid contribution to the news report. And in an era when The Times has to reinvent itself to survive, experimentation is necessary. Yes, Times leadership must uphold the paper\u2019s standards, credibility and higher purpose, but simply maintaining the status quo isn\u2019t nearly enough these days.Advertisement"}

They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there aren\u2019t enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs.Yet the data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. So why aren\u2019t they being hired?Those who enter the candidate pipeline fall out somewhere along the way \u2014 and the culture and recruiting methods of tech companies seem to have a lot to do with it.The pipeline problem is not a myth.

Forty percent of young Asian graduates do so, compared with 16 percent of black graduates and 12 percent of Hispanics, according to American Community Survey data.Meanwhile, 10 percent of black computer science and engineering graduates have office support jobs, which include administrative support and accounting jobs, compared with 5 percent of white graduates and 3 percent of Asians.\u201cAny student of color looking at the numbers from the tech giants is going to be turned off and wary about taking a job there because it tells you something about what the climate is,\u201d Ms. Beasley said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the token.\u201dRecruiting is another issue. Part of it is looking not just at Stanford and M.I.T. but also at places like historically black colleges. Even at the colleges that tech companies typically recruit from, students who are not white or Asian might not be in the networks to know about opportunities at tech companies.Tristan Walker, a tech start-up founder and chief executive of Walker & Company, said he didn\u2019t know about Silicon Valley until he was 24 and arrived at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\u201cThere definitely isn\u2019t a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. \u201cThese folks aren\u2019t working hard enough, they\u2019re just not.\u201dWhen companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply don\u2019t show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But they\u2019re more likely to come to workshops, like for writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or preparing for interviews.\u201cThat gets a higher yield in terms of students showing up, and they leave with an impression that we value them and their growth, as opposed to it just being a sales pitch,\u201d she said.Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews \u2014 asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.\u201cThere\u2019s still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard,\u201d Ms. Powers said. \u201cThat does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview,\u201d because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.Some researchers offer other strategies: Use standardized interview questions, not subjective ones; evaluate hiring managers based on whether they bring in diverse candidates; build a Rolodex of potential hires by working with networking groups for minorities; hire more than one minority member in each batch of new hires, so they have a support network.Techniques like these could expand the pipeline for tech companies \u2014 and for any other industry, too.Advertisement"}

In the recording, Mr. Emadi can be heard multiple times requesting sexual favors from Ms. Shirani. It is unclear who the second official is.In another exchange, Mr. Emadi asks Ms. Shirani to come to his house after she has finished working the night shift.The audio recording, posted by Ms. Shirani on her Facebook page, continues with Mr. Emadi saying he is lying in bed naked. He insists that he has \u201calways helped\u201d her and begs Ms. Shirani to have phone sex with him \u201cfor just five minutes.\u201dMs. Shirani firmly tells him that she owes him no favors and just needs a job to support herself and her son. In reply, Mr. Emadi sends images of himself asking for compliments for losing weight and calling himself \u201ca sexy, perverted\u201d guy. Most parts of the conversation were explicit. She tried repeatedly to end the conversation.Press TV is a part of the Voice and Vision organization of Iran, a powerful state media organization that is widely seen as a tool of the country\u2019s hard-line factions. One expatriate journalist who previously worked for Newsweek said that Mr. Emadi doubled as an interrogator in the Evin prison and once interrogated him. Mr. Emadi was later placed on a European blacklist of human rights violators.The public announcement of the suspensions has surprised observers, who point out that usually such incidents are hushed up or relabeled.\u201cWe have seen cases of Iranian diplomats abroad being accused of sexual harassment,\u201d said Mojgan Faraji, a journalist promoting reforms. She referred to a case in 2012 when an Iranian diplomat fondled girls who were 9 to 15 years old in a pool in Bras\u00edlia. Iranian officials called it \u201ca cultural misunderstanding\u201d at the time, and the diplomat was later fired. \u201cBut this suspension in some ways means admission,\u201d Ms. Faraji said.The incident has also led to debate on social media. Several women have said such forms of harassment are commonplace in Iran, where unemployment is high and laws overwhelmingly favor men.Press TV, in a statement on its website in Persian, did not identify the two suspended officials. Sexual harassment is not mentioned, and the statement stresses that the release of the recording \u201cwith cooperation of the regime\u2019s opposition\u201d was done in order to damage Iran\u2019s political system.The statement also said that Ms. Shirani has made no formal complaint inside Iran.Mr. Emadi was put on the European Union\u2019s human rights sanctions list by the European Court of Justice in 2013, after Press TV broadcast a series of forced confessions by detainees who had been tortured. Maziar Bahari, an Iranian reporter and documentarian, identified Mr. Emadi as the man who forced him to make a false confession while imprisoned in 2009.An earlier version of this article conflated two of the exchanges between Sheena Shirani and Hamid Reza Emadi that were posted on her Facebook page. Mr. Emadi\u2019s requests for sexual favors were made in a phone conversation with Ms. Shirani; his request that she come to his house after finishing work was part of a separate exchange. The article also misstated the nature of his request in the phone conversation. He suggested having phone sex, not physical sex.Advertisement"}

That finally materialized Thursday night as the candidates faced off at the University of New Hampshire in a forum hosted by MSNBC that was scheduled after much back-and-forth between the two campaigns.Both candidates came prepared, and were fiery. Mrs. Clinton was sharp and clear, with prepared jabs at Mr. Sanders. She accused him of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cartful smear\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding the speaking fees she has received from major banks, a claim he took issue with but did not really rebut. However, Mrs. Clinton seemed uncomfortable answering a question about those speeches, saying she would \u00e2\u0080\u009clook into it\u00e2\u0080\u009d when asked by one of the moderators, Chuck Todd, whether she would release the transcripts of those paid addresses. She fared better in her accusations that Mr. Sanders would undo President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature health care law.Mrs. Clinton appeared at ease talking about foreign policy, on which Mr. Sanders still seemed to struggle. Asked about the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he said that King Abdullah II of Jordan had \u00e2\u0080\u009chit the nail\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the head when describing how fighting the terrorist group should work. As in previous debates, Mr. Sanders also pulled some punches that he might have been able to land.Absent from the debate for much of the night was a discussion of two hot-button issues for Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gun control and immigration. Gun control is one of the only areas where Mrs. Clinton can hit Mr. Sanders from the left.Mr. Sanders, who has often frustrated his aides by not preparing for debates, seemed ready for this one. And while he is still trying to pass a commander-in-chief test, he seemed buoyed by his close second in the Iowa caucuses.

Think Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, or Pat Buchanan on the Republican side in 1992 and 1996.There are times when candidates drop out and the others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want their endorsement. And then there are those who drop out and everyone scratches their head and races to Google \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like when you read the obit of an actor you thought had died years ago.I see Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the second kind of candidate, an unwelcome endorsement. He was, in my view, pretty inept in the campaign, except in that one final debate in New Hampshire when he made Senator Marco Rubio look like an amateur robot who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think on his feet.

It clearly referred to statements by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem implying that\u00c2\u00a0women who support Bernie Sanders are not feminists or are just chasing boys, which\u00c2\u00a0did some serious damage to Mrs. Clinton:To young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others define you.

Feminism doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut down conversations or threaten women. It is not about ideology. It is not a weapon to wield against your political opponent. A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her God-given gifts.That is pretty well taken.

The message resonates because the rot is there.He has emerged from a political system corrupted by money, locked in an echo chamber of insults, reduced to the show business of an endless campaign, blocked by a kind of partisanship run amok that leads Republican members of Congress to declare they will not meet with President Obama\u2019s eventual nominee for the Supreme Court, let alone listen to him or her. This is an outrage! The public interest has become less than an afterthought.Trump is a man repeatedly underestimated by the very elites who made Trumpism possible. He\u2019s smarter than most of his belittlers, and quicker on his feet, which makes him only more dangerous.He\u2019s the anti-Obama, all theater where the president is all prudence, the mouth-that-spews to the presidential teleprompter, rage against reason, the backslapper against the maestro of aloofness, the rabble-rouser to the cerebral law professor, the deal maker to the diligent observer. If Obama in another life could have been a successful European social democrat, Trump is only and absolutely of America.Part of the Trump danger is that he\u2019s captured an American irredentism, a desire to reclaim something \u2014 power, confidence, rising incomes \u2014 that many people feel is lost. Trump is a late harvest of 9/11 and the fears that took hold that day. He\u2019s the focus of vague hopes and dim resentments that have turned him into a savior in waiting. As with Ronald Reagan, it\u2019s not the specifics with Trump, it\u2019s a feeling, a vibration \u2014 and no matter how much he dissembles, reveals himself as a thug, traffics in contradictions, the raptness persists.So do a few Europeans, among them the French rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is a fan, as are some Russian oligarchs. Judge a man by the company he keeps.This disoriented America just might want Trump \u2014 and that possibility should be taken very seriously, before it is too late, by every believer in American government of the people, by the people, for the people. The power of the Oval Office and the temperament of a bully make for an explosive combination, especially when he has shown contempt for the press, a taste for violence, a consistent inhumanity, a devouring ego and an above-the-law swagger.As Europe knows, democracies do die. Often, they are the midwives of their own demise. Once lost, the cost of recovery is high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.C.L.A. Gymnast Slips In Hip-Hop Moves, and the Online Crowd Goes Wild", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byThe floor exercise in gymnastics is all about the tumbling, right? Sure, in between the runs the gymnast shows off her balance or does balletlike moves, but that\u2019s just a moment for athletes and fans to catch their breath.DeJesus set aside those normally staid moments in between the tumbling to whip, nae nae, hit the quan and perform other hip-hop dance steps.The unexpected moves, combined with the enthusiastic reaction from fans and DeJesus\u2019s teammates on Saturday, made the video a must-watch for hundreds of thousands and brought an outpouring of positive comments on social media.\u201cI love dancing,\u201d DeJesus said of her decision to try the unorthodox routine. \u201cI wanted to end my senior year with a bang.\u201dShe added: \u201cMy sister Savannah is an awesome dancer. She helped me with the choreo and made it more fun.\u201dThe floor exercise is not even DeJesus\u2019s best event; she was an all-American on bars, and she has made only limited floor appearances over her U.C.L.A. career. Saturday\u2019s performance, which was widely shared on social media, was her first floor exercise of the season.When dancing on the show, DeJesus said, she would throw in some gymnastics moves.DeJesus\u2019s score for Saturday\u2019s routine, a 9.925, tied for third on her team at the meet, trailing two excellent \u2014 if less popular online \u2014 performances and raising the question of how much colorful moves help or hinder scoring from traditional judges.Dance moves in the floor exercises are often overlooked. \u201cCommentators mostly talk about tumbling because it seems to be more impressive to an audience and it\u2019s easier to spot the deductions in landings, height and form,\u201d said Samantha Peszek, an Olympic silver medalist and a former U.C.L.A. teammate of DeJesus\u2019s.DeJesus\u2019s innovation may not lead to perfect 10s, but \u201cit is a subjective sport with human judges, so it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Peszek said.\u201cThe great thing about routines like Sophina\u2019s is that they bring energy and life not only to the audience, but the rest of the team watching,\u201d she added.Would such crowd-pleasing moves actually hurt with more conservative judges? \u201cThe only time dance choreography would hurt a score is if it was inappropriate or if they considered it sloppy,\u201d Peszek said. \u201cBut most of the time if the entertainment value is in a floor routine, it can only help their score.\u201dSo at the Olympic Games this summer in Rio de Janeiro, will we see Danes doing the Dougie and Serbs doing the Stanky Leg?Probably not, Peszek said.\u201cThere are way more requirements to an Olympic-level routine in terms of tumbling and leap elements, so there wouldn\u2019t be enough time to do as elaborate choreography as Sophina,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, international judges seem to appreciate more traditional style of floor choreography, so a floor routine like this would not score as well as it does in collegiate competition.\u201dThe era of gymnastics nae nae is probably not over, though. DeJesus said that if she were selected for future meets, she planned to continue doing her routine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staying Sober After Treatment Ends", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Getting sober is hard. Making sobriety last is much harder. Most people who go into a residential rehab treatment manage to detox and stay that way during their weeks- or months-long stay. But problems begin when they leave. Many patients walk out the door \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and fall off a cliff.They go back to their old drinking or drug friends and places. The stresses of normal life resume. And exactly at the moment they need it most, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re essentially on their own.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTypically, what people have been told to do is go to a lot of Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James McKay, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center on the Continuum of Care in the Addictions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe usual line is 90 meetings in 90 days, and once-a-week group counseling in some sort of outpatient facility.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLeaving rehab presents other dangers. The threat of overdose is greatest after a period of abstinence. The cravings remain, but spending time sober decreases drug tolerance, so a previously survivable dose can now be a killer. The same dangers apply to people newly released from jail or prison, if they did not have access to drugs inside (which many do).The lack of resources for people when they are at their most vulnerable makes no sense. No doctor would help a patient control his blood sugar or blood pressure once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then wave goodbye. The same should be true of addiction. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chronic disease that requires long-term, possibly lifetime, care. So why has care been so scarce?One reason is money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInsurance didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used to cover anything post-discharge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mady Chalk, a former official of the federal agency that provides substance abuse services, Samhsa, and now the director of the Center on Policy Research and Analysis at the Treatment Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was an admission, treatment and then your discharge. And then people entered into a phase that used to be called \u00e2\u0080\u0098after-care.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 After-care is after care.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis is changing. One reason is the Mental Health and Addiction Parity Act of 2008, which required insurers to treat mental health like physical health in group health plans. Obamacare then expanded the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach to cover individual health insurance plans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, of course, has also extended insurance to millions more people.Another part of Obamacare is pushing health systems to gradually abandon fee-for-service payment plans and move to value-based models that reimburse based on outcomes, or that offer a set fee for treating a disease. This makes the detox-rehab churn a money-loser for health providers. Governments, too, are realizing the enormous costs to society of untreated drug and alcohol addiction.A related reason is that the face of drug abuse is changing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a factor that has led to a softening of drug policy in general. In the last decade, 90 percent of new heroin users have been white, and suddenly people in power are noticing that drug abuse requires help, not punishment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen decades ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe field has finally really accepted the idea these are problems that are often times chronic, and lot of patients need long term support if they are going to get better and stay better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said McKay.Medicaid is now starting to cover continuing care, and so are many private insurers.Massachusetts, hit hard by opioid and heroin addiction, recently passed a law compelling insurance companies to cover necessary outpatient care. Finally, continuing care means more than handing a patient a list of local A.A. meetings.Opioids and heroin have brought down the age of addiction, and treatment centers must adapt to a younger population. In 2012, Gosnold began an intensive recovery program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe started piloting it in response to a lot of younger people leaving inpatient treatment and not being able to navigate a continuing care plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kristoph Pydynkowski, the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first recovery manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can be very difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but younger people needed even more guidance. They had to make such a profound change at 19, 20 or 21. I sit down with someone who looks at me like his life is over: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Who do I hang out with? What do I do? How do I stay away from old friends? How do I make new ones?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dPydynkowski, who kicked heroin eight years ago, is one of nine recovery managers, each working with about 10 patients at a time. Before the patient leaves rehab, he sits down with him and maps out the days, writing in every medical appointment and counseling session. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you need a ride? If one of my patients misses one counseling appointment, I throw them in my car and drive them to every single appointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe goal is to get people to the point where they no longer need his services, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very far away at first. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey need to find activities they can enjoy that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t associated with drugs or alcohol,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He goes to the gym and to yoga with patients. He took one 21-year-old patient out at dawn to go fishing; they sat together in silence, watching for the sun to come up.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was with one kid five days a week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he felt like a surrogate father. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was heating water for his mother at his house, waiting for the family to come home. They want me to bathe the ferret! How do you bathe a ferret?\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.A-Chess users wake up to a daily question: How confident are you of your abstinence today? A \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot very confident\u00e2\u0080\u009d answer alerts family members and the recovery manager. Patients also undergo a weekly comprehensive health survey.Before patients leave rehab, they work with their counselor to load into the app high-risk locations like their usual bar or a park where dealers hang out. When the patient ventures near one, he gets an alert: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you sure you want to be here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and people whom the patient has designated are also contacted.\u00c2\u00a0One night at 10, Pydynkowksi got an alert that a patient was in a fast-food restaurant that had been a using spot; he had gone with the purpose of buying drugs. Pydynkowski texted him to wait, drove over, scooped him up and took him to Dunkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Donuts for coffee. Crisis averted.The app also has a panic button; pushing it alerts designated people that a patient needs immediate help.Many of Pydynkowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patients use the app to communicate with him and each other over message boards. One patient in her early 20s asked for help; her dog had just died and her father was sick. Three of her peers in the program picked her up and took her to dinner at Friendly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.Mullens, from First Choice, said her clients are heavy users of A-Chess, especially the discussion board. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt perhaps gives client who might be more shy face-to-face a way to express themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also able to share sober events and resources \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they post if they need a ride to a meeting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But she said that the app had not been readily adopted by clinicians, who were too busy to spend the time necessary to learn how to use it.Apps, by themselves, are not a continuing care program. But since they are used on phones, they are a logical tool to help people stay connected to their programs. David Gustafson, the University of Wisconsin professor who led A-Chess\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development, said that the evidence is that people in recovery need three things: social connection, motivation (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe desire to keep on keeping on\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and confidence that they know how to cope with their struggles. Apps can help with all three.

{"Headline": "Israeli Police Officer Is Killed in Attack by 3 Palestinians in Jerusalem", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe assault was the latest in a four-month wave of Palestinian attacks against Israeli security forces and civilians. Israeli officials said the officers were attacked after they became suspicious and approached two of the men, asking to see their identity cards. Those two men began to stab and shoot at the officers, the police said, and a third assailant fired at the police from behind.The two police officers who were injured were both female. One \u2014 Hadar Cohen, 19 \u2014 died of her wounds a few hours later at a hospital.The attack took place in a predominantly Palestinian area of East Jerusalem, near the Damascus Gate of the Old City. It was not immediately clear where the assailants were going when the officers approached them.Officials said that the officers had apparently headed off what could have been a much deadlier attack. The pipe bombs the assailants were carrying did not go off at the scene; they were detonated harmlessly later by bomb disposal experts.Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon, a senior Israeli military commander who briefed reporters on Wednesday before the attack, said that the recent surge in violence was not likely to end soon and that the army assumed it would continue throughout 2016.According to the police, the three assailants on Wednesday were all around 20 or 21 and came from Qabatiya, a village in the northern West Bank. Palestinian news media reports identified them as Ahmad Zakarna, Muhammad Kamil and Ahmad Abu al-Rub.\u201cYour men are coming with gunfire,\u201d Mr. Zakarna wrote in his post. \u201cMay you rest in peace in heaven and may God grant us the privilege of becoming martyrs.\u201dAli Zakarna, a cousin of Mr. Zakarna and a spokesman for Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian party, in Qabatiya, said the three Palestinian assailants in Wednesday\u2019s attack were good friends of the man who was fatally shot in November. \u201cOur children\u2019s actions are only a reaction to the continuous harsh Israeli occupation,\u201d Mr. Zakarna said. \u201cThe shooting and killing of their friend,\u201d he continued, \u201cencouraged these youths to seek revenge against the enemy.\u201dLocal officials said the Israeli military had surrounded Qabatiya and was not allowing anyone to enter or leave.General Alon, who heads the military\u2019s operations directorate, said \u201cthe footprints of Hamas,\u201d the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, could be seen in efforts to encourage terrorism, even though most of the assailants were \u201clone wolves,\u201d acting without the assistance of any organization.In a statement on Wednesday, Hamas praised the attack but did not claim responsibility for it. Deal or no deal, he said, the \u201cstrategic challenges to Israel mainly come from Iran,\u201d including Iran\u2019s support for militias like Hezbollah and Hamas and the country\u2019s continued development of longer-range missiles.Still, General Alon said, the Israeli military believes that Iran will have little interest in violating the nuclear accord in the next three to five years. Low oil prices make it \u201cessential for Iran,\u201d he said, to reap the financial \u201cfruits\u201d of the accord instead.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, Politics Photoshopped", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 On the evening of Feb. 20 at around 8:40 p.m., while the graduate student Kanhaiya Kumar was locked up in Tihar Jail on sedition charges, his profile picture on Facebook was changed. The new photo, which showed a group of soldiers levering a flag-pole into a wasted hilltop, looked familiar except for one detail. In place of the Stars and Stripes flapping in the wind in Joe Rosenthal\u2019s original 1945 shot of Iwo Jima, an Indian flag was flying full and proud.It is likely that Mr. Kumar\u2019s account was hacked, and that his picture was replaced to signal that subversive thinking will always be surmounted by nationalists, like that hilltop by the valiant warriors.The same altered photo had recently been brandished on prime-time television by Sambit Patra, a spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. \u201cLook at our Indian soldiers!\u201d he had remonstrated. \u201cIndian soldiers, dying, but holding up the tricolor at the border.\u201d The government has been quick to use images as political ammunition, never mind their veracity.The B.J.P. won its historic majority in 2014 thanks partly to its masterful handling of optics. Narendra Modi, who would become prime minister, often campaigned via hologram, even winning a place in the Guinness World Records for most simultaneous virtual appearances. But well into its second year in power, with TV media acting as enablers, an image-addicted B.J.P. risks losing both technical and ethical control over what it shows the country.For a time, the outing of manipulated visuals, usually ones aggrandizing Mr. Modi, hardly seemed to compromise the government itself. In December, the Press Information Bureau published a photograph showing the prime minister sitting at an airplane porthole, surveying the flooded city of Chennai from above. In fact, the watery view had been cut and pasted into his window. Skeptics caught on, yet the public laughed off the relatively benign manipulation: Mr. Modi\u2019s aerial survey was real, even if the picture wasn\u2019t.But few people have been laughing over recent footage, broadcast on national television, that allegedly showed radical students chanting separatist slogans at Jawaharlal Nehru University, here in New Delhi. On Feb. 12 the police charged Mr. Kumar, the president of the student union, under the colonial-era law of sedition. Leading news networks rallied behind the government, keel-hauling the students and their \u201canti-national\u201d apologists. Dubious images from online activists fueled the hysteria.One photograph, circulated by right-wing student leaders and partisans on Facebook and Twitter, showed Mr. Kumar giving a speech in front of a map of a splintered India, in which the states of Kashmir and Gujarat have been annexed to Pakistan. It was the perfect visual illustration of his high treason \u2014 except that it had been Photoshopped. In the original, there is nothing behind Mr. Kumar but a neutral background, possibly a canvas wall.In the week after the protest, news networks repeatedly aired a video clip that seemed to catch Mr. Kumar shouting slogans for Kashmir\u2019s independence \u2014 and would clinch the state\u2019s case that he was personally guilty of seditious speech. One night on India\u2019s political debate show, \u201cThe Newshour,\u201d the B.J.P.\u2019s Mr. Patra \u2014 again \u2014 produced an iPad and announced: \u201cKanhaiya Kumar, that fateful day, also shouted anti-India slogans! I have the video.\u201d The host demanded, \u201cShow the video!\u201d The camera drew in for the kill. There was Mr. Kumar: buffering slowly, and calling out for azadi, freedom.It now appears that this video was a hoax as well. Forensic experts have said it splices together audio of separatist slogans with visuals from a speech Mr. Kumar did give, but that called for freedom from hunger, feudalism, capitalism and caste.This fraud was checked, though not before top journalists and a spokesperson for the ruling party took part in it. Spectacle first, questions later. Damage done.India has had plenty of proof that misleading images can be used to poison national conversation and instigate sudden violence. In 2012, a riot in Mumbai was set off in part by images on Facebook purportedly showing Muslims being slaughtered in the state of Assam. They turned out to be a mosaic of grisly visuals from across Asia.Now distorted images are being used to stir up a hateful frenzy against provocative student activists.To delete a manipulated photograph is easy; to correct a manipulated opinion is not. Doctored images can be exposed, and they have been, but each one leaves a permanent warp in the public\u2019s mind. They chip at Indians\u2019 confidence in what the state and the media are presenting to them. And they drive us away from the shared ground of reliable fact into the opposing trenches of hard-line conviction.An earlier version of this article misstated the date when the police charged Kanhaiya Kumar with sedition. It was Feb. 12, not Jan. 12.Advertisement"}

Fire Department medical workers continued trying to resuscitate him upon arriving. Anthony was then taken to Staten Island University Hospital North, where he was pronounced dead.The New York City medical examiner\u2019s office had not determined the cause of death on Monday, and the police said no charges had been filed. An emergency room doctor described Anthony\u2019s injuries to investigators, though the police said they could not offer additional details publicly.Anthony\u2019s grandmother, who declined to give her name, said on Monday, \u201dI\u2019m barely keeping it together.\u201dShe said the woman who was babysitting Anthony on Sunday had started to help his mother, Marta Delgado, with child care three or four months ago, on and off. \u201cI trusted my daughter\u2019s judgment,\u201d she said.Neighbors said that they regularly heard the woman fighting with her boyfriend, and that the police had often been called to their apartment.Gladys Rivera, 75, who lives across the hall from the woman, expressed bafflement that the child had been left in her care. \u201cShe can\u2019t babysit herself,\u201d she said.Ms. Rivera said she was in bed on Sunday night when she heard shouts coming from the apartment. She said her daughter, who also lives on the building\u2019s second floor, advised her against getting up because \u201cthey fight all the time.\u201dMs. Rivera said the woman was unemployed, and had lived in the apartment with her boyfriend for around five years. She said the boyfriend would often bang on her door mistakenly after coming home late.Anthony\u2019s grandmother said the woman had a son of her own who was about 8 years old and had gone to live elsewhere last year, perhaps for health reasons.In a statement, the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services said, \u201cWe are investigating the circumstances that may have led to the heartbreaking and tragic death of this little boy.\u201dAs officers stood outside the babysitter\u2019s second-floor apartment on Monday afternoon, Gabbii Retamar, a friend of Anthony\u2019s mother, lit a white votive candle and placed it at the base of a streetlamp in front of the brick apartment building, next to a stuffed horse cradling a heart.Ms. Retamar said she was responding to a Facebook post Ms. Delgado had written that morning, asking for prayers for Anthony.\u201cI told her I was sorry, I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to lose a child,\u201d Ms. Retamar, herself a mother, said. \u201cShe cared about her baby very much.

Robert E. Fowler Sr. welcomed them by telling members of the church, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited that they are here, and I am encouraged that they are willing to sit at the same church, at the same service, at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton sat on one side of the church, accompanied by Mr. Lewis, while Mr. Sanders, who brought his wife, Jane, sat on the other. Mr. Fowler told both candidates that he wanted to them to explain why people should vote for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders, your camp contacted us first, so you have the opportunity to go first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fowler said.Mr. Sanders spoke for about 10 minutes, saying that there were competing philosophies in the world and that he wanted to create a government focused on helping all Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of us believe that what God teaches us and what this world is about is that we do not turn our backs on our brothers and our sisters, that essentially we are in this together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have four beautiful kids and seven grandchildren. I want you to worry about my kids, and I have got to worry about your children and your grandchildren. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this church is about, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what our existence is about.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to become a billionaire.\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders added that America had a higher rate of childhood poverty than almost any other major country and a\u00c2\u00a0high unemployment rate among African-American youth, yet gave \u00e2\u0080\u009chuge\u00e2\u0080\u009d tax breaks to the rich.In particular, Mr. Sanders said, Nevada bore the brunt of Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greed as one of the hardest-hit states during the 2008 recession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis state was decimated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.He then talked about the need to reform police departments and to give former inmates education, job training and other resources to ensure that they can become employed.Mr. Lewis introduced Mrs. Clinton and said, \u201cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a senator, secretary of state. Look, she is prepared, she is ready.\u201dMrs. Clinton, who like Mr. Sanders repeated several lines from her stump speech, spoke of the common ground she shared with him.\u201cMy esteemed opponent and I agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can never let big banks wreck our economy. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, Mrs. Clinton added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a single-issue candidate, and this is not a single-issue country.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause if we were to achieve everything about banks and money in politics, would that end racism? Would that make it automatically going to happen that people would be able to get the jobs they deserve, the housing they need, the education their children need to have?\u201dLater in the day, Mr. Sanders spoke to 1,700 supporters at Bonanza High School and repeated that he would focus on income inequality, immigration reform and regulating Wall Street if he were elected.\u201cIf we win here in Nevada, we send a profound message to the entire country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat message is that people in this country will no longer accept establishment politics and establishment economics.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Three of the teenagers were sentenced to five years in prison, while the fourth, who is still under 18, is to be detained at a juvenile detention center.The teenagers did not attend Thursday\u2019s hearing, and their lawyer said they would appeal the decision. \u201cTheir parents have sent them to uncles and aunts outside of Minya,\u201d Mr. Naguib said. \u201cThey feared for their safety. They are all terrified and crying now.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said Mr. Regeni might have been killed as a result of criminal activity or a personal dispute, but made no mention of accusations from Italy that the security forces were involved.\u201cThe Italian had many relationships with people near where he lives and where he studied,\u201d the ministry said in a statement that some human rights activists took as a sign that the police were trying to divert suspicions elsewhere.Copts, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt\u2019s 90 million people, have for decades complained of discrimination. Mr. Naguib said he feared that the growing atmosphere of intolerance in the country could hurt his clients\u2019 chances of a successful appeal.\u201cHow can we be optimistic in a climate where everything is taken so sensitively?\u201d said Mr. Naguib.In the video, one of the students is shown kneeling on the ground, pretending to recite verses from the Quran, as his friends stand laughing behind him. At one point, one of the four places a hand under the neck of another, as if to behead him.The clip was filmed by one of their teachers, also a Christian. He has been convicted on charges of contempt of Islam in a separate trial in relation to the same incident.A year ago, Mr. Sisi, in an address to Egypt\u2019s clerical leaders, urged them to purge Islam of the ideas that encourage violence and have made the religion \u201can enemy of the world.\u201d But since then, the courts have often focused on cases that impinge on civil rights, including free speech.And last week, a Cairo court sentenced a writer, Ahmed Nagy, to two years in prison for publishing an excerpt from his novel in a magazine that was deemed to have offended public morals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reporting Scalia\u2019s Death, With All Deliberate Speed", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorWHEN it comes to covering the death of a sitting Supreme Court justice, what a difference a decade makes.In the late summer of 2005, The Times\u2019s longtime Supreme Court reporter, Linda Greenhouse, found out about the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist when the court\u2019s press officer called her and said, \u201cLinda, the chief died.\u201dMeanwhile, The Times was gearing itself up for a huge wave of stories, all from a standing start. The newspaper did have an obituary prepared, but while Chief Justice Rehnquist had been ill for some time, Justice Scalia\u2019s death was unexpected.In general, the week\u2019s coverage went well \u2014 impressive in terms of depth and scope \u2014 but not without a few bumps along the way, especially early on.A few of the issues that arose brought reader mail. Some readers were upset that The Times was slow to announce the news on Saturday afternoon. Others were bothered by the fact that their Sunday print editions \u2014 some of which have Saturday afternoon deadlines \u2014 did not carry the Scalia news at all.On the matter of The Times being slower to send out an alert about the justice\u2019s death, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, told me that he had believed unusual caution was called for. \u201cI was nervous about alerting it; there was something about what we had that worried me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one where if you get it wrong you can never come back.\u201dBob Swofford was one reader who was disappointed by that. \u201cI wanted to get an immediate, authoritative story from The Times in short order,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut had to rely on other sources.\u201dAdam Liptak\u2019s fine obituary for Justice Scalia, written about two years ago, was a key element in the coverage, but it didn\u2019t appear in its entirety right away. A few paragraphs posted with the news alert. But even though the 4,700-word obit was essentially ready, because of the need for updates, it was about an hour before a full version was posted.\u201cI breathed a sigh of relief knowing that we had pre-written an enormous Scalia obituary a couple of years ago,\u201d Mr. Liptak told me. (The Times often has obituaries in hand for public figures.)Still, having a prepared obituary does not do much good for print readers if a prominent figure happens to die at the wrong time of day, and some subscribers were unhappy, among them Don Noel of Connecticut, a former newspaper editor who wrote to register his dissatisfaction.\u201cAt 5:44 Saturday afternoon, I got a \u2018breaking news\u2019 notification from The Times on my iPhone reporting the death of Antonin Scalia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore than 12 hours later, my Sunday Times was delivered to my doorstep in Hartford \u2014 with not a single word about Scalia\u2019s death.\u201d He wrote: \u201cMaybe print journalism is deader than I\u2019d thought.\u201dMr. Liptak told me about a conference call run by the Washington bureau chief, Elisabeth Bumiller, with at least 12 reporters and editors taking part. \u201cWhen the institution springs to life, it\u2019s really something to see,\u201d he said.Given the fact that a lengthy obituary had already been prepared, it was unfortunate that it took so long to post it in full. And while early print deadlines for the Sunday edition are a fact of life, it\u2019s regrettable that many print subscribers had no whiff of this huge news in their Sunday paper.Finally, on Mr. Kieval\u2019s complaint, I agree that, in an ideal world, the news media \u2014 and society in general \u2014 would be able take a few hours to reflect on a public figure\u2019s life before delving into the process of finding (or delaying) his replacement. But we don\u2019t live in that world, and I don\u2019t fault The Times for jumping immediately into the fray. In fact, I think it was the only way to go.That fray will not be over any time soon, as every sentient being knows by now. Nor should it be expected to be, since the stakes are so high. As Mr. Liptak put it, \u201cThis has the potential to reshape American life for 30 years.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained an incomplete quote from Eliot Kieval.An earlier version of this column misstated when a longer obituary of Justice Scalia was posted. It was about an hour after the news alert was sent, not almost two hours.Advertisement"}

So You\u2019re Not So Special.", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byMY teenage son recently informed me that there is an Internet quiz to test oneself for narcissism. His friend had just taken it. \u201cHow did it turn out?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe says he did great!\u201d my son responded. \u201cHe got the maximum score!\u201dWhen I was a child, no one outside the mental health profession talked about narcissism; people were more concerned with inadequate self-esteem, which at the time was believed to lurk behind nearly every difficulty. Like so many excesses of the 1970s, the self-love cult spun out of control and is now rampaging through our culture like Godzilla through Tokyo.This is a costly problem. While full-blown narcissists often report high levels of personal satisfaction, they create havoc and misery around them. There is overwhelming evidence linking narcissism with lower honesty and raised aggression. It\u2019s notable for Valentine\u2019s Day that narcissists struggle to stay committed to romantic partners, in no small part because they consider themselves superior.The full-blown narcissist might reply, \u201cSo what?\u201d But narcissism isn\u2019t an either-or characteristic. It\u2019s more of a set of progressive symptoms (like alcoholism) than an identifiable state (like diabetes). Millions of Americans exhibit symptoms, but still have a conscience and a hunger for moral improvement. At the very least, they really don\u2019t want to be terrible people.To solve the problem, we have to understand it. Philosophy helps us do so every bit as well as psychology. The 18th-century French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote about \u201camour-propre,\u201d a kind of self-love based on the opinions of others. He considered it unnatural and unhealthy, and believed that arbitrary social comparison led to people wasting their lives trying to look and sound attractive to others.If our egos are obese with amour-propre, social media can indeed serve up the empty emotional carbs we crave. Instagram and the like doesn\u2019t create a narcissist, but studies suggest it acts as an accelerant \u2014 a near ideal platform to facilitate what psychologists call \u201cgrandiose exhibitionism.\u201d No doubt you have seen this in others, and maybe even a little of it in yourself as you posted a flattering selfie \u2014 and then checked back 20 times for \u201clikes.\u201dTranslating Rousseau\u2019s wisdom into a master plan to rescue our culture may itself seem grandiose. But it can help each of us shed the traits of the narcissist. Here is an individual self-improvement strategy that combines a healthy self-love (for Valentine\u2019s Day) with a small sacrifice (possibly for Lent).Second, get rid of the emotional junk food that is feeding any unhealthy self-obsession. Make a list of opinions to disregard \u2014 especially those of flatterers and critics \u2014 and review the list each day. Resolve not to waste a moment trying to impress others, but rather to treat them (and yourself) with kindness, whether it is earned or not.Third, go on a social media fast. Post to communicate, praise and learn \u2014 never to self-promote. What have you got to lose? Only your distorted, reflected self.A subheading last Sunday for an essay about narcissism incorrectly described a figure of Greek mythology. Narcissus was a mortal, not a god.Arthur C. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing opinion writer. Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s like an eight-year term.\u201dMr. Trump, who later corrected the spelling in the Twitter post, is 69.\u201cI only reach two conclusions,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, 44, going in for the kill. \u201cNo. 1, that\u2019s how they spell those words at the Wharton School of Business where he went.  Or No. 2, just like Trump Tower, he must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets.\u201dMr. Rubio\u2019s shift in demeanor from the earlier days in the campaign, when he rarely went off script or off message, was striking. With Mr. Trump having won three consecutive contests \u00e2\u0080\u0094 New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Florida senator\u2019s calculation is that he can no longer afford to be passive when he comes to Mr. Trump.And the best way to challenge him, Mr. Rubio has concluded, is to give Mr. Trump a taste of his own humor. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Pentagon to Offer Plan to Store Eggs and Sperm to Retain Young Troops", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter believes he has come up with a way to help the Pentagon retain troops: freezing sperm and eggs.As part of an initiative to make military service more appealing and family friendly, Mr. Carter has created a pilot program that will pay for troops to have their reproductive cells preserved.The goal is to give those in uniform the peace of mind that if they are hurt on the battlefield \u2014 hundreds of veterans suffered injuries to their reproductive organs in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 they would still be able to have children.The program is also meant to encourage women to stay in the military during their 20s and 30s, a time when many leave after giving birth. By freezing their eggs, they will have the flexibility to remain deployed overseas or otherwise pursue their careers and put off having children.Women who reach 10 years of service \u2014 what Mr. Carter called \u201ctheir peak years for starting a family\u201d \u2014 have a retention rate that is 30 percent lower than their male counterparts.Few companies offer egg and sperm freezing, so the initiative will place the Pentagon \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest employers \u2014 at the forefront on the issue, reproductive advocates said. Some Silicon Valley companies like Facebook have begun offering to cover the cost of freezing eggs \u2014 which can be more than $10,000 \u2014 to help recruit top female candidates.But the initiative, which Mr. Carter first mentioned in a speech last week about improving retention, raises legal and ethical questions that Defense Department officials will have to navigate.\u201cFreezing sperm and eggs is not like freezing chicken for dinner,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center. \u201cWhat happens if you die \u2014 can your wife use it? And what if your mother wants grandchildren and your wife doesn\u2019t, does that mean the sperm can be used with a surrogate? If you\u2019re cognitively disabled, can it be used? And what happens if the company housing your sperm or eggs goes bankrupt?\u201dDr. Caplan said that the practice of freezing eggs had become widespread only in the past five years, and that it could be more problematic than preserving sperm, which has been done for decades. He said the Pentagon should inform service members that the freezing of eggs is not always successful and can cause complications.\u201cIf your eggs won\u2019t work, you won\u2019t find out until you\u2019re 39,\u201d Dr. Caplan said.A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on the legal and ethical questions, saying that details were being worked out. The Defense Department is expected to outline the program in a memo from Mr. Carter in the coming weeks. The program, which applies only to active-duty service members, will be re-evaluated in two years, and could ultimately be made permanent.\u201cAs many families know all too well, these treatments are very expensive and often require multiple attempts,\u201d the spokesman, Matthew Allen, said. \u201cWe know that providing this benefit across the board would result in a significant cost for the department. In addition to cost, we want to better understand the importance of this to our force, as well as its impact on recruiting and retention. In addition to hormone therapies and egg and sperm freezing, we are going to continue looking at ways to provide additional support for these types of treatments in the future.\u201dThe Pentagon estimates that the program could cost about $150 million over five years. It will be offered through Tricare, the military\u2019s health care plan.During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, several cryogenic firms offered to cover the cost for troops to have their reproductive cells frozen. It is not clear whether any soldiers ultimately used those materials to have children. In recent years, some fertility advocates have lobbied the Defense Department to cover the cost.\u201cThis investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\u201cParticularly for women who are midgrade officers and enlisted personnel, this benefit will demonstrate that we understand the demands upon them and want to help them balance commitments to force and commitments to family,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cWe want to retain them in our military.\u201dThe initiative is part of a series of measures that Mr. Carter has pushed to create what he calls \u201cthe force of the future.\u201d He is worried that the military has not adapted enough to compete with top companies for millennials, who put a greater emphasis on work-life balance than did previous generations.In November, Mr. Carter said that the Pentagon would expand its sabbatical programs to more service members so they could gain experience in academia or different industries. He said that the military was working to modernize its retirement benefits and was creating a LinkedIn-style program to match service members with open positions. In December, he opened all combat positions to women.Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said he hoped that the rest of the federal government would follow the military\u2019s lead.\u201cThis is the difference between a returning military member being able to have children or not,\u201d Mr. Tipton said. \u201cWe think this country has an obligation in its power to keep its military members whole, and building families is certainly part of being whole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Group to Air Ads Featuring Ex-Students Saying Trump University Deceived Them", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "The American Future Fund, a conservative nonprofit group, is preparing what a spokesman said is a multimillion-dollar ad campaign highlighting people who say they were ripped off by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise.

But the hard-hitting ads strike Mr. Trump in an area his critics have long perceived as a vulnerability, and his opponents have largely avoided.In mood and message, the commercials resemble the ads Democrats ran against Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, featuring people who said they had been victimized by Mr. Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business practices at the private equity firm Bain Capital.Mr. Trump said in the debate that the claims against him in the Trump University cases were baseless. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I could have settled many times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do it out of principle.\u201dHe continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people that took the course all signed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Trump took aim at two rivals ramping up assaults on him there, ahead of the next Republican primary.  He anticipated the appearance of George W. Bush on behalf of his brother Jeb Bush, promising some choice words once the former president hits the campaign trail next week. But he foreshadowed an attack over President Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty to say about what happened,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said, adding that the elder Bush brother led the country into \u00e2\u0080\u009cquicksand.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump saved his greatest ire for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, divining deeply into a defense of eminent domain in response to a blistering new television ad by Mr. Cruz accusing Mr. Trump of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpattern of sleaze\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his businesses.

{"Headline": "Free the Tampons", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Call it the period paradox. Everyone knows most girls and women menstruate, but even in the age of oversharing, periods are treated like a dirty little secret.Now a growing number of advocates, entrepreneurs and female lawmakers are challenging the taboo, talking about menstruation publicly (and, yes, in mixed company). They want periods put squarely on the public agenda, and are demanding that businesses and government take menstruation into consideration when they design facilities, develop budgets, supply schools or create anti-poverty programs. And they want tampons in every public restroom. And they want them to be free.For those who are squeamish about all this, the message is: Get used to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think many people, men and women, are probably a little uncomfortable thinking or talking about menstruation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of how we can change the conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier this year, Ms. Meng noticed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not allow homeless assistance funds to be used for feminine hygiene products, even though they covered soap, diapers, toothpaste and underwear.

The machines and sanitary supplies are being donated by Hospeco, a Cleveland-based personal care products supplier.Other initiatives are emerging around the country. In Wisconsin, legislators have introduced a bill that would make free sanitary products available in restrooms in all public state buildings, including schools.In Columbus, Ohio, Councilwoman Elizabeth Brown wants restrooms at the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recreation centers and community swimming pools similarly supplied, as well as the public schools. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGirls who get their period shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go to the nurse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Brown said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe underlying message with that is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Certainly we can all agree that having your period is not a monthly illness.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt George School, a private school in Newtown, Pa., Vienna Vernose, a senior, was upset after a boy reacted by saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cew\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a tampon fell from her backpack.

Rosenthal, a New York State assemblywoman, called the taxes \u00e2\u0080\u009ca regressive tax on women and their bodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Notably, items that are not subject to the tax include condoms and sunscreen.Ms. Meng has introduced federal legislation that would allow women to buy feminine hygiene products with flexible spending account funds, which can be used to cover certain medical and dental costs, prescription drugs, prescription eyeglasses and items like bandages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not sanitary pads or tampons.For women to publicly demand menstrual supplies as a basic right is a sea change in thinking, said Chris Bobel, president of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research and an associate professor of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and gender studies at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe message to women has been: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Menstruation is your problem, ladies,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your job is to render it invisible.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dA medium-size package of sanitary products can cost between $7 and $10, plus tax, and a woman could use one package per cycle\u00e2\u0080\u0094 making them a significant expense for poor women and girls. Yet food pantries do not receive a regular donated supply of sanitary pads, said Margarette Purvis, president and chief executive of Food Bank for New York City. She said her organization receives the products sporadically, usually when a retailer has torn packages that cannot be sold.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something the state should maybe take into consideration for those of us who are really struggling, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the last thing on their minds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lakeisha Adams, a 39-year-old Queens mother of four who relies on public assistance, and says she has had to borrow money from relatives to buy menstrual products.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI grew up with five brothers, so I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something a lot of men just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hear about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Adams. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most important things for a woman to have available.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIndeed, many men will go to great lengths to avoid the subject, said Ms. Kramer, the organizer of the Free the Tampons campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey stick their fingers in their ears, \u00e2\u0080\u0098la-la-la, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to me about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 until I say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you have a daughter?

{"Headline": "Support for Breast-Feeding, in a Multitude of Ways", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.In 2001, when Dr. Alison Stuebe was pregnant with her first child, breast-feeding was a personal challenge that soon morphed into a professional research interest. Her son Noah was 3 months old when she began her residency in maternal-fetal medicine at Brigham and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital in Boston. Determined to nurse him for a year, she arrived at the hospital carrying a breast pump and, through sheer determination, more than met her goal. Noah was 2\u00c2\u00bd before he was weaned.In the years since, with two more breast-fed sons, Dr. Stuebe has become a leading expert in the health value of breast-feeding for both mother and baby and a tireless advocate for new mothers trying to navigate its all-too-frequent challenges.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMoms deserve better support, and obstetric providers can and must help, both by assisting their patients and by advocating for policies and practices that enable women to achieve their goals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. And, the guidelines maintain, that support should begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy.To be sure, much has changed for the better since 1972, when breast-feeding by American women reached its nadir of 24 percent. Just three years prior, when my twin sons were born and a serious postpartum infection kept me in the hospital for 13 days, isolated from them, I had to beg for a breast pump every four hours. My desire to breast-feed was belittled by the nurse in charge: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can always feed them formula,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said dismissively as I dissolved in tears.Faced with financial and logistical stresses, many new mothers find it challenging to meet such a goal. Working women rarely get more than six weeks of paid maternity leave, and once back at work, the obstacles to expressing and storing breast milk can be daunting.Accordingly, the new guidelines urge policy changes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotect the right of a woman and her child to breast-feed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid maternity leave, on-site child care, break times for expressing milk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a place \u00e2\u0080\u009cother than a bathroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d to do so. Two decades ago, a former colleague of mine gave up her dream job after two frustrating months pumping milk in the office lavatory.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBreast-feeding is optimal and appropriate for most women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the new guidelines state. However, they add, while advice and encouragement by obstetric professionals are recommended, no woman should be coerced, pressured or unduly influenced to breast-feed.Among the few medical contraindications to breast-feeding are infections in the mother \u00e2\u0080\u0093 H.I.V., untreated tuberculosis, chickenpox or a herpes lesion on the nipple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and mothers being treated with cell-killing cancer drugs. Although clear-cut data are lacking on the effects of marijuana on breast-fed infants, the drug can get into breast milk and the guidelines discourage marijuana use by nursing mothers. Babies with the genetic disorder galactosemia, which impairs digestion of a sugar in milk, should not breast-feed.During pregnancy, women trying to decide whether to breast-feed deserve to be informed about both its benefits and barriers and be given an opportunity and assistance to find ways around any obstacles, the guidelines state.Both mother and baby benefit from breast-feeding. Women who breast-feed have a lower than average risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease later in life. Breast-fed infants enjoy greater protection from infections, sudden infant death syndrome and metabolic disease. Babies born prematurely especially benefit from breast milk, which lowers their risk of infections, especially necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious intestinal disease.Assessing the health of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breasts and her prior experience with breast-feeding should be part of prenatal care, the guidelines urge. Past or anticipated difficulties and concerns should be discussed, ideally in conjunction with the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner, and strategies devised to make the desired feeding plan compatible with the needs and values of the woman and her family.Ultimately, the obstetric guidelines conclude, a well-informed woman is best qualified to decide whether to breast-feed exclusively, combine breast with formula-feeding or feed only formula.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPhysicians should not be dogmatic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Stuebe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFormula is not poison. Like antibiotics, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed, it should be used judiciously.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI created my own plan when I could produce only a quarter of the milk my twins were consuming and faced conflicting advice from the obstetrician and pediatrician. I chose to combine the advice, first offering each baby the breast, then topping it off with formula. When I finally began producing enough milk, they all but gave up the bottle.As in the past, the new guidelines disparage an all-too-common practice of outfitting new mothers at discharge with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgift bag\u00e2\u0080\u009d that contains samples of formula, which can suggest that the hospital endorses formula feeding. Direct-to-consumer marketing of infant formula is also disparaged.But even the most determined breast-feeder can sometimes have difficulty at first establishing successful nursing. Such women face an increased risk of developing postpartum depression \u00e2\u0080\u009cand should be screened, treated and referred appropriately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the guidelines note.Accordingly, there is now a growing legion of professional lactation specialists who can help. Some hospitals have them on staff. More good news: The services of a certified lactation consultant or counselor are now covered as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.A lactation specialist may also be helpful to women who stop nursing before they want to because of problems with pain, low milk supply or difficulty getting the infant to latch on to the breast.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

But on Monday night, he held nothing back, and the crowd of thousands met every one of his lines with whooping cheers.Addressing another protester, a man holding a sign that read, \u00e2\u0080\u009cVeterans to Trump: End Hate Speech Against Muslims,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump repeatedly said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet him the hell out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the crowd booed the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exit.Mr. Trump, who has amplified criticism of Mr. Cruz in the last week using his ability to draw media attention, called him a \u201cliar\u201d and said that it was the reason he lost evangelical voters in South Carolina. \u201cThis guy is sick \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u2019s something wrong with this guy,\u201d said Mr. Trump, a criticism that could be damaging for Mr. Cruz as the race heads into a string of Southern contests with conservative voters on March 1. Mr. Trump did not  limit his rough talk to protesters and his rivals on Monday. Referring to the Iranians who took 10 Navy sailors hostage in January, Mr. Trump said the leader of the Iranians was a \u00e2\u0080\u009crough guy with a rough mouth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to smack the hell out of him.\u201dHe also repeatedly belittled Sgt.

As Iowans were heading to the caucuses on Monday, members of Mr. Cruz\u2019s team spread rumors that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was dropping out of the race and encouraged his supporters to back Mr. Cruz.Mr. Carson was, in fact, planning to go home to Florida the next day and pick up some clean clothes. Mr. Cruz called him to apologize and said that what his staff members did was unacceptable.But on Wednesday Mr. Carson, who came in fourth place in Iowa, said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s apology was not enough.\u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that there were people who tried to take advantage of a situation and tried to distort information,\u201d Mr. Carson said.He went on to quote a passage from the Bible that says, \u201cBy their fruit you will know them,\u201d and suggested that the situation revealed something about Mr. Cruz\u2019s character.\u201cLet me put it this way, when I discovered that there were things in my campaign that I couldn\u2019t agree with after making an investigation, I made changes,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what a good leader does.

{"Headline": "Syrian Officer Gave a View of War. ISIS Came, and Silence Followed.", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byReporter\u2019s NotebookBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Ours was an unusual, sometimes operatic, correspondence that unfolded over more than a year. Abu al-Majd, a Syrian police officer who was being deployed more and more often like a soldier, texted at all hours, sending news from the front lines and grumbling about boring, sunbaked patrols, his complaints sometimes punctuated by expressions of terror, pride or doubt.For us, it was a critical window into the raging war in Syria that we were too often forced to follow from afar. For him, it seemed, as much as anything, about having a connection to people who lived outside the claustrophobia of war, yet cared about what he was going through.On May 19 last year, Abu al-Majd sent a pair of snapshots. One showed him in fatigues, smoking a water pipe and starting to smile, as if a friend had just walked in; two cups of Turkish coffee, still foamy, stood on a table.He had taken the photos specially. \u201cThese,\u201d he texted, \u201cmight be the last pictures.\u201dWe did not hear from him again. Six weeks later, his parents received a call from a man who identified himself as a soldier and warned, \u201cDon\u2019t be hopeful.\u201d Then he hung up.They went to a security office, where a bureaucrat handed them a piece of paper that said: \u201cMissing.\u201d That stark label, it turned out, masked a terrifying tale of a fighter\u2019s desperate bid for survival, and his struggle between duty and fear.Palmyra, also known as Tadmur, had lost its main livelihood, tourism, and on its grid of concrete-block streets, men sat around with little to do. Islamic State militants were just a few miles east, while Syrian Army tanks occupied the medieval citadel above the ruins.Women whispered to us of relatives who had been kidnapped, or had disappeared into government custody after a local rebellion was quashed. Some of our escorts were jumpy, and a few shopkeepers stared at them with icy eyes. For junior officers like Abu al-Majd, our visit was rare entertainment. At the ruins, they clambered over huge slabs of limestone, striking playful poses.A month later, Abu al-Majd texted just to say hello. Later he opened up, talking about things he missed, like pomegranates and grapes from the volcanic soil of his family\u2019s ancestral village in the Golan Heights. As the conversations grew deeper, he seesawed between pride in his national duty and fear, boredom, even anger at the injustices and incompetence he saw in the government\u2019s prosecution of the war.Checking in regularly, he joined several hundred contacts we maintain inside Syria by telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and other media: army defectors, Islamist insurgents, activists, government officials, business owners, doctors, commanders on all sides. There are people who support the government, people who loathe it, and people from what they call \u201cthe gray middle,\u201d who just want the war to end.A Quiet LoyalistHe was a loyalist \u2014 the son of a retired, low-ranking army officer \u2014 but not someone who plastered his Facebook page with Syrian flags or pictures of dead insurgents or pledges of allegiance to President Assad. Mostly, he shared photos of his friends and nephews.He had joined a regular police unit at least a year before the uprising, chasing drug dealers and prostitutes. But as war put pressure on the army, many police units were sent into the fray. Abu al-Majd was deployed to front-line checkpoints and patrolled for insurgent activity east of the central city of Homs, around Palmyra.With supplies scarce and the Syrian pound plummeting in value, he joked that his salary, around $100 a month, was barely enough to keep him stocked with his favorite apple-flavored tobacco. He was secretly in love with one of his cousins, but now worried that he could never afford to marry her. The isolation ate at him.\u201cPlease, tell me the latest news,\u201d he wrote in September 2014. \u201cWe don\u2019t have TV here, no electricity, I\u2019m living in exile. I\u2019m dead, dead.\u201dWhen he got leave, Abu al-Majd went home to cosmopolitan Damascus. He was jealous of troops serving in the capital who could drink and go out with women and enjoy relatively regular electricity, he once said, \u201cas if they are in Europe.\u201dHe confided that he consoled himself with the music of the Lebanese pop artist Wael Kfoury; one of his favorite lyrics was, \u201cI wish I could bring you a gift the size of my love.\u201d\u201cIf I die,\u201d he asked, \u201cwould you say, \u2018God bless his soul?\u2019\u201dHe shared a memory from 2012 that haunted him. He had been on the phone with a friend whose fighting position was being stormed by insurgents.\u201cI could feel the knocking on his door,\u201d Abu al-Majd recalled. \u201cDo you know that feeling when someone you know, and you like a lot, will be killed in a few minutes, and you don\u2019t know what to do?\u201dHe complained that Lebanese Hezbollah militiamen backing the government earned more than Syrian fighters, and that troops at busy checkpoints farther west raked in bribes while on the desert front, he said, \u201cwe are eating air.\u201d\u2018Something Called Patriotism\u2019In spite of his frustrations, Abu al-Majd felt that \u201cone shouldn\u2019t turn against his government whatever they do.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing called \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018against\u2019 Bashar,\u201d he explained, referring to the president. \u201cThere\u2019s something called patriotism, nationalism, loyalty \u2014 something called \u2018we are Syrians and we should defend our nation.\u2019 You are either with the state or with the terrorist groups.\u201dHe said he wished he would wake up in his old house to find the war had been a dream.\u201cIf I had known how deep was the sea, I would never have swum,\u201d he said, quoting the Damascene poet Nizar Qabbani. \u201cIf I had known my end, I would never have begun.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re giving two families one portion,\u201d he told us later. \u201cNot only that, they are saying dirty words to people, as if the civilians are beggars.\u201dAbu al-Majd wrote to Hwaida Saad, a Times reporter, on WhatsApp and other platforms. \u201cBefore the events I was different,\u201d he said on Feb. 4, 2015. \u201cI used to be a soccer player. I was a fan of Real Madrid. But I haven\u2019t watched sports for four years. Little television. Little electricity.\u201dThe next month, he was outraged after his cousin, a new conscript, was sent to Idlib Province, where the army was losing ground. One day, Abu al-Majd said, the cousin called to report that he and nine others were surrounded, without vehicles, and digging a hole to hide in. Over the sound of gunfire, he asked Abu al-Majd, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201dAbu al-Majd was beside himself.\u201cWe need 10,000 soldiers, not just 10,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine, they put them in that place to meet their fate.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m Committing Suicide\u2019Abu al-Majd was on leave in Damascus as the extremists reached the edge of Palmyra. His mother tried to keep him there by hiding his ID card. He debated asking for a transfer, testing the sincerity of a presidential declaration a few months before that gave men the option to serve close to home.\u201cI\u2019m not a coward, but I\u2019m a human being who sometimes gets scared,\u201d he said, adding, as if looking for approval, \u201cAm I right?\u201dBut the next day he decided to go back out. He soon learned his unit would be sent to Palmyra; the commanders said they would report anyone who did not join.\u201cI\u2019m committing suicide,\u201d Abu al-Majd told us. \u201cI\u2019m walking on my feet toward death, but I can\u2019t do anything. Don\u2019t ask me what time I\u2019m leaving; I hate this question. I wish I wouldn\u2019t wake up tomorrow.\u201dHis messages were a drumbeat of anxiety.May 16: He shared a Facebook post from a friend: \u201cO God, homeland, your heroes are living in graves, and your thieves are in castles.\u201dMay 17: He reached Homs, and went to a fortune teller. She saw him moving to a pleasant place, \u201cgreen, with trees all around.\u201d Paradise?May 18: A reprieve. Land mines on the road to Palmyra had forced his bus to turn back.May 19: The last snapshots.Then: nothing.We had followed many battles, but Palmyra was different. It was resonant as the home of Syria\u2019s most magnificent antiquities, and we had been there recently. We knew archaeologists, antigovernment activists, tribal leaders, tea shop owners and security men. We even knew a fighter with the invading Islamic State force. Together they gave us an up-close, real-time view of a city falling.The Islamic State beheaded government employees in the street, shot soldiers in an ancient amphitheater and gave bread to residents. Government warplanes dropped bombs, as officials incorrectly declared that all civilians had been evacuated. Activists opposed to both Mr. Assad and the Islamic State went into hiding.A young intelligence officer we had met in Palmyra \u2014 he had shown us pictures of himself in a helicopter loaded with the barrel bombs often dropped on rebellious neighborhoods \u2014 told of escaping with nothing but his gun. Another police officer, with a reputation for torturing suspects, described walking for a day and a half across the desert to reach safety. Before fleeing, he said, he had seen Abu al-Majd at the military airport, wounded in the leg and shoulder.Abu al-Majd\u2019s social-media status was frozen at \u201cI am in Tadmur,\u201d or Palmyra, followed by a frowny face. \u201cPrecious, don\u2019t be sad for me. We are from God and to God we return.\u201d\u201cI talk to you because someone hears my voice,\u201d Abu al-Majd wrote on May 5, 2015.It was July 23 when we heard from Abu al-Majd\u2019s family that he was officially missing. They gave up on learning more from security officials \u2014 \u201cdogs,\u201d one relative called them \u2014 and, presuming he was dead, hosted mourners and received condolences.We needed to know more.How It EndedIn the ensuing months, we reached two police officers who had stayed in touch with Abu al-Majd to the end and three Palmyra residents who had witnessed his fate, and we compared notes with relatives. This is what we learned.On May 19, about 60 officers and soldiers had boarded unarmored buses bound for Palmyra, with flak jackets but no weapons. Abu al-Majd was terrified to go, but unsure of what punishment he might face in a country where people could go to prison and simply disappear, was also terrified not to.\u201cHe kept calling all the way from the bus, \u2018We\u2019re going to die,\u2019 repeating those words,\u201d one of his fellow officers recalled. \u201cI told him to give the driver any excuse, like he wants to buy cigarettes, and then run away, but he never listened to me.\u201dThe bus dropped the men at the military airport on the outskirts of Palmyra, which was attacked that night. Many were killed; the others fled. Abu al-Majd hid in the house of a family he knew.He called Damascus daily from the land line, speaking softly, begging friends to send a car. His father told him not to surrender; his uncle advised him to read the Quran.But the Islamic State was threatening to kill anyone who harbored a government fighter. After eight days, Abu al-Majd felt he could no longer endanger his hosts, and fled down the street in a borrowed robe and loose pants, trying to pass for a resident.\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t a soldier,\u201d Abu al-Majd wrote on May 14, 2015, but \u201ca civilian, living a secure life, married, with someone I love, in a place with no clashes, no fear.\u201d\u00a0Then he quoted the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani: \u201cLove me away from our city, which is replete with death,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Days later, Abu al-Majd went silent.He must have walked down the same cinder-block streets where he had accompanied us a year earlier, lined with cellphone shops and bakeries. He went unnoticed until the call to prayer.The Islamic State requires men to attend prayers, so he entered a mosque. Inside, a fighter approached and asked Abu al-Majd if he was with the police.\u201cHe said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m here and I\u2019m praying and I didn\u2019t do anything,\u2019\u201d recalled a Palmyra resident who was there.The fighter responded, \u201cNow, you remembered to repent?\u201dOn the street outside, the militants announced his arrest, using his full name.\u201cI saw 10 Daesh fighters with their horrible faces, one holding the sword,\u201d a local woman told us later, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cThey beheaded him in front of my eyes.\u201dThe body lay in the street for several days, according to three witnesses. Last month, family members said security officials had told them they had a video of the killing, but did not share it.\u201cI blame the government,\u201d one relative said. \u201cWhat can 200 soldiers do against 2,000 Daesh? I don\u2019t have a problem with death, but with the way he died.\u201dIt is where we remember Abu al-Majd.

Some of them canceled trips to Iran, waiting for his release or at least to learn why he had been taken into custody in the first place.Citing privacy considerations, the State Department on Wednesday said it did not plan to release any information about Baquer Namazi\u2019s arrest.\u201cWe are aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in Iran,\u201d Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement.But at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican asked Secretary of State John Kerry about Mr. Namazi\u2019s arrest.\u201cI am very familiar with this and I am engaged on it specifically, but I am not permitted due to privacy reasons to go into details here,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, according to a transcript provided by the State Department.Ms. Namazi said that neither she nor a lawyer had been able to find out about Mr. Namazi\u2019s status. The lawyer, she added, was unable to get permission to see Mr. Namazi, a former Unicef representative in Kenya and Egypt.\u00a0She said Mr. Namazi has a serious heart condition as well as other health problems that require medication. The elder Mr. Namazi\u2019s detention came as Iran prepares for parliamentary elections on Friday. The elections have heightened tensions between hard-liners, who control the judiciary and the powerful clerical councils, and reformers. It was unclear if that acrimony had anything to do with the arrest.Siamak Namazi had been visiting Iran when he was arrested. He grew up in Iran, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt and the United States, studying international relations at Tufts and urban planning at Rutgers. He returned to Iran in 1999 as a consultant for foreign businesses, and in 2007 he moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wildly Popular App Kik Offers Teenagers, and Predators, Anonymity", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byThe allegations are beyond chilling: two Virginia Tech freshmen charged with the premeditated kidnapping and killing of a 13-year-old girl who, authorities say, communicated with her murderer online.But the way they chatted \u2014 on a wildly popular messaging app called Kik \u2014 has increasingly become a source of concern for law enforcement.Kik is cooperating in the investigation. Its officials say they responded to \u201cmultiple emergency requests\u201d from the F.B.I. for information that helped lead to the arrests of the students, David Eisenhauer, 18, and Natalie Marie Keepers, 19, both aspiring engineers from Maryland. And experts in Internet crime caution that the app is just one of many digital platforms abused by all manner of criminals, from small-time drug dealers to terrorists.\u201cKik is the problem app of the moment,\u201d said David Frattare, commander of the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which includes hundreds of law enforcement agencies. \u201cWe tell parents about Kik, and to them it\u2019s some earth-shattering news, and then it turns out it\u2019s been on their kid\u2019s phone for months and months. And as a law enforcement agency, the information that we can get from Kik is extremely limited.\u201dKik\u2019s appeal to young people goes far beyond anonymity. Teenagers like its special emoji and other features. It offers free and unlimited texting. And like AOL Instant Messenger and MySpace before it, Kik is a space that parents are unlikely to know about. But it is also place where inappropriate sexual content and behavior can flourish.Cases involving Kik in just the past 10 days include:\u201cThe Kik app has become so popular, it\u2019s probably the one where law enforcement has seen the most activity,\u201d said Leslie Rutledge, the Arkansas attorney general, who issued a public plea last year to parents in her state to educate themselves about their children\u2019s online habits after two Arkansas men used Kik to solicit nude photos from under-age girls \u2014 and an undercover investigator.\u201cWe view user names and anonymity as a safe way to connect with people you meet on the Internet,\u201d said Rod McLeod, a spokesman for Kik.Kik estimates that it has 275 million registered users worldwide, with 70 percent of them in the United States. (The company does not report figures for daily or monthly active users.) But the very anonymity and secrecy that make Kik appealing also pose serious challenges for law enforcement. The app asks for the user\u2019s real name and email address, but it works even if those are fictitious, and the user does not have to supply a phone number.Law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about apps that offer users greater anonymity and reach.Unlike some competing apps, Kik says it does not have the ability to view written messages between users, or to show them to the police. It can view pictures and videos, but retains them only until the recipient\u2019s device has received the message. Those practices are legal.With a court order or in a dire emergency \u2014 as in Nicole\u2019s death \u2014 the company can provide the authorities with a log of a user\u2019s sent and received messages, and in some cases can supply the user\u2019s Internet protocol address, giving a physical location.In deciding what information to store, the company says, it aims to \u201cstrike a balance\u201d between \u201cprotecting user privacy and the need to remove bad actors from our platform and assist law enforcement.\u201dBut Kik says it can find users on its system with only a user name. And because Kik is based in Canada, law enforcement officials say, it can be a slow process. Requests have to go through the United States Justice Department.\u201cThey\u2019ve assisted us in a lot of our cases,\u201d said Detective Josh Woodhams of the Bentonville, Ark., Police Department. \u201cBut when it comes to the content of conversations, they don\u2019t retain information including photos and videos. So it makes it tough for us.\u201dLaw enforcement officials say they often run across Kik in cases of \u201csextortion,\u201d or blackmail, in which a sexual predator coaxes a young person to send nude photos \u2014 and then threatens to post the photos online, or alert the child\u2019s parents or harm the child, if he or she does not send more.David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire said research suggests that social media has not spawned an uptick in violent crimes involving children, but cases involving pornography are on the rise. So are arrests.Professor Finkelhor cautions against \u201ctechnophobia,\u201d saying character traits \u2014 not technology \u2014 make young people vulnerable. Those who are socially isolated, who have conflict with their parents, who are bullied in school or who are depressed are \u201cat higher risk,\u201d he said, \u201cboth in face-to-face and electronic environments.\u201dThose risk factors were clearly present in the abduction in Virginia of Nicole Madison Lovell, whose mother, Tammy Weeks, has said she was bullied in school, in part because of the tracheotomy scar she bore from her liver transplant.And they were a factor in a November case involving Kik in Ohio, where a 15-year-old girl got in a car with a man she knew only through Kik, who drove her more than 500 miles from her home in Cleveland.On Kik, she found someone, claiming to be a man in his 20s, who offered her help and gave her the attention she craved, she said.With her phone gone, there was no way for the police to track the girl\u2019s movements or tie her to the man. But weeks later, law enforcement officials said, her abductor got cocky and careless and, posing as the girl on a Facebook account, he contacted her friends. With help from Facebook, investigators read the messages and tracked down Mr. Schroeder, who has pleaded not guilty to charges in federal and state court.Investigators learned only later that the girl had met Mr. Schroeder on Kik. Asked about the odds of finding her if the man had not gone onto Facebook, Mr. Frattare, of the Ohio crime task force, said, \u201cIn my opinion, it would have been slim to none.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was pressed by a man in the audience but declined to repeat what he had said, which many Republicans have criticized as going too far. Mr. Trump also mused about preferring fast-food restaurants such as Kentucky Fried Chicken because he said they\u2019re cleaner than other restaurants. And he conceded that he had made mistakes as a husband in his first two marriages, saying, as he tries to win voters in a heavily evangelical state, that he was a better father than a husband because he was heavily focused on his work.

Recorded phone messages are a time-tested political technique in South Carolina, often used as a difficult-to-trace method of disseminating harshly negative information to voters.The Courageous Conservatives PAC has aired provocative pro-Cruz ads in other states in the past. Rick Shaftan, the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead strategist, confirmed that it had sent out the phone message over the weekend, and that the group would go after Mr. Trump aggressively over the next few days.Mr. Shaftan said he had already cut two radio ads questioning whether Mr. Trump would appoint conservative judges to replace Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court justice who died on Saturday, as well as criticizing Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position on abortion, which has shifted over the years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to say it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shaftan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him call us liars.

And as soon as a company hits turbulence, calls for a management shake-up almost always follow.History suggests that changing course can have big results. But not every company has needed to shake up its ranks to regain its footing. And even those that did bring in new management have found themselves under attack again:In the late 1990s, Priceline seemed to have the golden touch. On its first day of trading in 1999, its market value hit $12.9 billion. At the time, it was the highest first day valuation of any company that had gone public.The company\u2019s stock plummeted. At one point, the company was worth less than $250 million.Over the years, Priceline acquired competitors including Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, becoming dominant in the online travel segment. By 2010, it surpassed Expedia in online hotel reservations. It now has a market value of $53 billion.Keeping competition at bay is critical for any technology company, said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf you\u2019ve discovered a valuable space, there\u2019s a lot of companies, new entrants,\u201d he said.Amazon was a pioneer in web retailing, beginning with online book sales in 1995. In 1999, Time magazine anointed the founder, Jeff Bezos, its Person of the Year. But the company had not recorded a profit in its early years, causing some analysts and investors to question whether it was any different than all the other dot-coms that failed by 2001.\u201cAt Amazon, they were ruthlessly committed to the customer experience,\u201d said Nick Donatiello, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cAnd that is still their strategy.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Bezos consistently relayed his growth plan to investors.That\u2019s unlike some tech companies like Yahoo and Twitter, Professor Hsu of Wharton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear communication either by way of their actions or their words as to how they are going stay relevant.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is unlikely Bezos could have anticipated how the various initiatives would turn out,\u201d he added. \u201cHe therefore had some sense of the necessary pacing of new business introductions to widen the touch points Amazon would need to ultimately win.\u201d\u201cIt took a change in management to clean up some prior misdirection and set a new strategy,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cTo make these changes, the company needed to \u2018reset expectations\u2019 and take the short-term hit from Wall Street as it invested for the long-term gain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because of how Alabama is, black kids don\u2019t have the political connections to make their voices count, so they\u2019re even more vulnerable.I\u2019ve experienced dozens of micro-aggressions: being forced off the sidewalk, or asked during class if all black people eat collard greens, or why the slaves didn\u2019t just free themselves \u2014 this was in American literature class; we might have been reading \u201cHuckleberry Finn.\u201d Having to put on a happy face and pretend these things aren\u2019t dehumanizing to me was a farce.The root cause of these issues is the Machine, an underground coalition of 28 fraternities and sororities that has controlled politics on campus for over 100 years. In recent decades, the Machine has been accused of assaulting and intimidating students \u2014 they\u2019ve been known to key cars and draw swastikas on campus \u2014 and electioneering in student government and local elections.A review of campaigns since 1900 provides linear and ideological connections to today\u2019s racial unrest.We Are Done was not just a protest; it\u2019s also a movement. We are done tolerating the bigotry, injustice and social inequality on campus. We have 11 demands, which include implementing a division of diversity, funding programs that support multicultural work, and requiring the trustees to acknowledge the Machine and take steps to bring it above ground. Our demands are not radical but a logical extension of human rights.The Legion of Black Collegians puts on a homecoming for black students. They were rehearsing for an upcoming event when people called them \u201cniggers.\u201d President Wolfe didn\u2019t find the need to do anything.About a week later, 10 of us stood in front of President Wolfe\u2019s car during the all-school homecoming parade. We each recited a line about an incident of racist violence at Mizzou since 1950. A police officer put his hands on my chest; we were shoved off the street. Wolfe\u2019s driver hit one of the demonstrators. Wolfe sat there and watched.That was our first major action under Concerned Student 1950. We wanted our voices to be heard. But a group of white people formed a line in front of us and began chanting over our reality. After, one black student, Jonathan Butler, decided to go on a hunger strike. The only way to save his life was to get Wolfe out of office. We had media, a petition that went around. Eventually, many of the football players announced they wouldn\u2019t play until he resigned. Wolfe resigned.New York Times journalists, student activists and college administrators discussed race on college campuses on Feb. 4.I have always wanted to give back to black people. Ferguson is two hours away. I had gone there in 2014 and added my body power to actions. Ferguson sparked a movement on campus that let us know we have the right to fight back. Now I definitely want to pursue a life in policy and social change.After reading Paulo Freire\u2019s \u201cPedagogy of the Oppressed\u201d in 11th grade, I understood that education was part of a system to help reproduce oppression and oppressive contexts.

Not teaching in schools, but education that helps you see yourself and your world differently.I\u2019m African-American and 6 feet 5. I\u2019m constantly followed in stores; I\u2019m pulled over a lot when I\u2019m driving. I was 18 and the police almost blew my head off because I reached for my registration too quickly. I\u2019ve never been taken in, but I\u2019ve had to pay a lot of fines for mundane things. I had to pay $200 because my taillight wasn\u2019t bright enough! That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting against.Just because Berkeley sits on the political left doesn\u2019t mean racism doesn\u2019t happen here. On campus, if more than five black people congregate, a police presence pops up. They never say anything; they just stand there and watch, which is creepy.Students at the social work school here held a teach-in over racist comments one of their white professors had made. He said Black Lives Matter should focus on black-on-black crime rather than police brutality. He read a rap song he wrote about it. First and foremost, it\u2019s empirically inaccurate for someone with a Ph.D. who studies vulnerable communities to assert such a thing. Second, to be so culturally insensitive as to insist that the only way you can get black students to understand is to do a rap song, especially in a graduate program at one of the top schools in the country, is insulting.If students at Princeton feel they must protest, then there is a problem that needs to be discussed. But they\u2019re not trying to discuss it, they\u2019re trying to force their ideals on the university. I respect what the student activists are doing here, but not the way they\u2019re going about it and the directions of the demands. They try to silence anyone who disagrees with them. It\u2019s a very \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality. On Facebook it was heavily hinted I was a traitor and white sympathizer.I don\u2019t think anyone reasonable would assume we are honoring Woodrow Wilson for his racism. The best way to acknowledge his legacy is to preserve the monument and reinforce the fact that he had appalling beliefs that were wrong then and wrong now. If we cannot look toward Wilson as a source of honor, then we can\u2019t go back to Jefferson, Plato, Aristotle. Margaret Sanger advocated eugenics! Abraham Lincoln had some very racist ideas. If we can\u2019t honor someone who has a past, there won\u2019t be anyone left to honor.I haven\u2019t experienced racism on campus at all. Part of it is the environment I\u2019ve been in \u2014 I\u2019m an athlete. I played football and we\u2019re treated differently. We get more respect.

{"Headline": "The View From the Back Row in Paris", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Photographers and film crews immediately swarmed a car as it glided in front of Place Vend\u00f4me on a Sunday night in late January, jostling to capture the beauty who stepped out. Bystanders craned to get a glimpse of a woman wearing a bright orange dress, cunningly engineered with provocative cutouts and bound with matching thin ropes, pulleys really, covering a few key bits. The word filtered through to the back of the hive that it was Rita Ora, the British pop star and fashion-show mainstay, and, crucially, someone clearly committed to working a dress.Ms. Ora was there for the Atelier Versace show and the start of couture week in Paris, which over the next four days would feature 25 shows on the official calendar, attracting hundreds of journalists and retailers, dozens of customers from markets as far-flung as Russia and China, tight bands of photographers cordoned off on a platform at each of the shows to record the elaborate, fantastical gowns for posterity, and a handful of celebrities to populate the front rows and satisfy the paparazzi.And me.For once, thanks to the offer to attend the shows as a neophyte and write about the experience, I would be able to witness the greatest spectacle in fashion \u2014 not just on Twitter and Instagram, but in person.Handsome young sentries, whose purpose seemed to be purely aesthetic, lined the hall of the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, the site of the Dior show. This was the first Dior show without the designer Raf Simons, and there was curiosity about the collection, of course, and speculation whether any of the regular Dior stars would show up. Paparazzi surrounded one woman. Was it Jennifer Lawrence? Charlize Theron? Natalie Portman? The sea parted: Olivia Palermo.That evening, as I headed off to Giambattista Valli, I began to panic. A longer-than-expected M\u00e9tro ride (no car and driver for me!) and then a wrong turn on the way to Le Carreau du Temple had us blocks away at the scheduled start time. No worries, my show companion told me, the shows do not begin on time, \u201cEver.\u201d (Sure enough, we sat inside for almost half an hour after arrival, marveling at the stars we still could not identify and at a woman who arrived in a gown with a long train, along with an assistant who carried that train for her until she was safely in her seat.)The Chanel clients dutifully surrendered their iconic quilted bags to the X-ray conveyor belt, while a larger utilitarian cross-body bag caused a slight commotion as the guards scurried to find a bin large enough to accommodate it.The atmosphere was decidedly familial. The Chanel-clad guests warmly greeted one another, some with plumb lips and tousled wavy hair, others of the thin, pulled-together Betsy Bloomingdale variety. One tall man with an elaborately and elegantly tied scarf told a friend: \u201cI am good. At this age, I\u2019ve decided I will be good. What else can one say?\u201dInside the Grand Palais was a heart-stopping set that would elicit heartfelt bravos at an opera, perfect for a \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d staged in Scandinavia. A large wooden structure (later described as a dollhouse or minimalist country home), surrounded by a garden (real grass) with a painted rich blue backdrop sky infused with sunlight. It was a memory of a landscape never seen.The actresses Juliette Binoche and Isabelle Huppert, as well as the Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, graced the front row. Handsome gray-haired men, immaculate in crisp shirts, expensive watches and presumably Armani suits, dotted the audience.It was surprisingly intimate. The actress Marisa Berenson, the house muse, warmly greeted the guests, embracing a woman in a kimono who was smiling and mingling. A check of her chair tag (she was to be seated next to Giancarlo Giammetti, the longtime business partner of the designer) and a quick Google search identified her as Madame Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, the widow of the artist Balthus. She was there in support of her daughter, Harumi, who designed the jewelry for the collection.Very impressive and all very chill. The only drama was confusion over the seating in the back row. Most were nervous to be caught playing musical chairs and potentially face a public humiliation. Two men took the logical action and decided to sit where there were empty seats. The show was called for 6:30 p.m., and it was approaching 7. One looked at his watch, impatiently. \u201cTell him, it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d his comrade said.Harp music cued the show\u2019s start, and models floated by in serpentine gold headpieces, barefoot, across petals, in diaphanous, airy dresses, and coats with what looked to be antique velvet, yet, of course, was not.The thousands of hours spent creating the collection, the details and the vision, combined with the ethereal impermanence of the shows, was mind-blowing. The urge to document the experience prompted me to overshare during the week with my 111 Instagram followers and 432 Facebook friends. The posts racked up likes and comments from nonfashionista friends enjoying the contact high. A last photo of the impossibly stylish front-row beauties at Valentino was captioned, \u201cC\u2019est Fini.\u201d\u201cThank God,\u201d one armchair spectator posted. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201dThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201dPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.Apple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201dConor Dougherty and Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms\u2019 Online Content", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byChina is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval.The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video.The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval.China already has some of the world\u2019s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years.Legal scholars say the new rules seem aimed at restricting any type of content that might be considered a threat to the Communist Party, or social stability, with the regulations hinting at a greater effort to bring anything published by foreign entities under Chinese law.\u201cThis is the latest in a series of legal changes that seek to restrict the influence of foreign or western ideas,\u201d said Jacques deLisle, an authority on Chinese law who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also part of a larger attempt to exercise control over the Internet and new media.\u201dThe new regulations, though, do not detail exactly what types of content and which organizations would be affected. Though the new rules, for example, might seem to apply to foreign news organizations in China, existing rules already restrict global media outlets from posting content on the Internet using servers inside China. Most global news outlets, including The New York Times, are published on servers outside China, and are unlikely to be affected by the new rules.Still, legal experts say the regulations announced this week are broad enough to pose challenges to a wide range of foreign multinationals operating in China, since many of them act as distributors of online content or services.There are also questions about how such regulations would be enforced, and what types of companies would be considered distributors of online content. As a result, they could raise market-access issues for foreign companies in China ahead of trade talks with the United States.Analysts say Chinese laws are often vague and broad, which gives regulators the ability to claim greater jurisdiction. As a result, how laws are implemented is often more important than the letter of the law.One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple\u2019s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.A large number of foreign games for smartphones are released through joint ventures between Chinese companies and multinationals, and it appears the new regulations could affect those partnerships.Multinational companies have long complained that the rules in China are discriminatory. Foreign firms need licenses that can be difficult to get to operate web services in China, and there are restrictions on their ability to invest in many Chinese sectors. Several big companies, including Microsoft, have also been the subject of anti-trust investigations.The regulations stipulate that anything published online should \u201cserve the people\u201d and promote socialism and do no harm to national interests, barring, for instance, the spreading of rumors or propagating evil cults.Paul Gillis, an accounting expert who teaches at Peking University in Beijing, says a lot will also be determined by the way China executes and enforces the rules, since there is tremendous variation in the way laws are enacted and enforced in the country and to whom they apply.\u201cWhat about law firms and accounting firms \u2014 are they going to be subject to these rules?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what about companies that just have an instruction manual online, are they also going to fall under this type of rule?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using a Mother\u2019s Microbes to Protect Cesarean Babies", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "The first germs to colonize a newborn delivered vaginally come almost exclusively from its mother. But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room.That difference, some experts believe, could influence a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifelong health. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section.The small proof-of-principle study suggests a new way to inoculate babies, said Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and lead author of the report, published on Monday in Nature Medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe study is extremely important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who did not take part in the work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust understanding that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible is exciting.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut it will take further studies following C-section babies for many years to know to what degree, if any, the method protects them from immune and metabolic problems, he said.Scientists have theorized that these children may be missing key bacteria known to play a large role in shaping the immune system from the moment of birth onward. To replace these microbes, some parents have turned to a novel procedure called vaginal microbial transfer.A mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaginal fluids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 loaded with one such essential bacterium, lactobacillus, that helps digest human milk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are collected before surgery and swabbed all over the infant a minute or two after birth.An infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first exposure to microbes may educate the early immune system to recognize friend from foe, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.Friendly bacteria, like lactobacilli, are tolerated as being like oneself. Those from hospital ventilation vents or the like may be perceived as enemies and be attacked.These early microbial interactions may help set up an immune system that recognizes \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-self\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the rest of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.In the United States, about one in three babies are delivered by C-section, a rate that has risen dramatically in recent decades. Some hospitals perform the surgery on nearly seven in ten women delivering babies.An ideal C-section rate for low-risk births should be no more than 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization.Dr. Dominguez-Bello\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study involved 18 babies born at the University of Puerto Rico hospital in San Juan, where she recently worked. Seven were born vaginally and 11 by elective C-section. Of the latter, four were swabbed with the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaginal microbes and seven were not.Microbes were collected on a folded sterile piece of gauze that was dipped in a saline solution and inserted into each mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vagina for one hour before surgery. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector.One to two minutes after the babies were delivered and put under a neonatal lamp, researchers swabbed each infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, face, chest, arms, legs, back, genitals and anal region with the damp gauze. The procedure took 15 seconds.Dr. Dominguez-Bello and her colleagues then tracked the composition of microbes by taking more than 1,500 oral, skin and anal samples from the newborns, as well as vaginal samples from the mothers, over the first month after birth.For the first few days, ambient skin bacteria from the delivery room predominated in the mouths and on the skin of C-section babies who were not swabbed, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. They were all covered with lactobacilli.Gut bacteria in both C-section groups, however, were less abundant than that found in the vaginally delivered babies.Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth.The results show the complexity of labor, said Dr. Alexander Khoruts, a microbial expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cannot be simplified to a neat, effortless passage of the infant through the birth canal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.As the month progressed, the oral and skin microbes of all infants began to resemble normal adult patterns, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But fecal bacteria did not, probably because of breast or formula feeding and the absence of solid foods.The transfer fell short of full vaginal birth-like colonization for two reasons, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Compared to infants who spent time squeezed inside the birth canal, those who were swabbed got less exposure to their mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s microbes.And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.A larger study of vaginal microbial transfer is underway at N.Y.U., Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Eighty-four mothers have participated so far.Infants delivered both by C-section and vaginally will be followed for one year to look for differences in the treated and untreated groups and to look for complications. Thus far the swabbing has proved entirely safe.The procedure is not yet recommended by professional medical societies, said Dr. Sara Brubaker, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at N.Y.U. Until more is known, physicians are hesitant to participate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it has hit the lay press,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPatients come in and ask for it. They are doing it themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Brubaker is one of them. When her daughter was born three and a half months ago, she arranged to have her baby swabbed.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Former N.A.A.C.P. President Endorses Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Benjamin T. Jealous, a prominent black leader and former N.A.A.C.P.  president, endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president on Friday and vowed to increase his support among black voters in South Carolina, a crucial primary state, as well as across the country.Mr. Jealous, who led the N.A.A.C.P. from 2008 to 2013, said he gave his endorsement because Mr. Sanders opposes the death penalty, will combat institutional racism and has \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best plan for ending mass incarceration and improving community policing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As the race for the Democratic presidential nomination moves beyond Iowa and New Hampshire into more diverse primary states, Mr. Sanders must work hard to compete with Hillary Clinton, who has a big lead on Mr. Sanders among black voters, who have known and supported her and former President Bill Clinton for years.Mr. Jealous said he planned to spread Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message and believed the race between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton was reaching \u00e2\u0080\u009ca real tipping point.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving helped strengthen Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts in 2008, I know how things can turn very, very quickly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Jealous said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs somebody who has organized throughout the entire South, I intend to be very engaged and to help build the campaign in the South and quite frankly help to build it in the cities of the Midwest and throughout the country where you see both large black and brown populations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Jealous and Mr. Sanders made the announcement during a conference call on Friday after snow in New Hampshire forced the campaign to cancel a news conference in Exeter, N.H.In explaining his plan to help Mr. Sanders, Mr. Jealous also praised his  past work and his policy ideas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThroughout his life he has been a fearless, tireless and trustworthy champion for the right of all our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children to have full and unfettered access to the American dream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Jealous said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie Sanders has the courage to confront the institutionalized racism and bias that stains our nation. Bernie Sanders leads with the sort of freedom-minded conviction that strikes fear in the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the worst of Wall Street.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders stressed that his plans to make public colleges tuition free, to raise the minimum wage and to focus on creating jobs would especially help people of color, who face higher rates of incarceration, and black youth, who face higher rates of unemployment. The senator also said, as he has in the past, that if elected he would work on reforming police departments and federally decriminalizing marijuana possession.He added that he knows he is not well known in South Carolina, especially among black people, but expects to make \u00e2\u0080\u009chuge progress\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the state. He also said that as soon as New Hampshire votes, he would be spending as much time as possible in Nevada and South Carolina, where the nominating contests come later this month.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, frankly, that we do have the agenda that will make sense to the African-American community both in terms of economics and in terms of criminal justice and other issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think our job is to get that agenda out aggressively, and I think Ben Jealous is going to be an enormous help in enabling us to do this not only in South Carolina but across the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "The Robots Are Coming for Wall Street", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueHundreds of financial analysts are being replaced with software. What office jobs are next?Supported byNadler couldn\u2019t have double-checked all this analysis if he wanted to. It was based on thousands of numbers drawn from dozens of databases. He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand. But most of the additional space is taken up by a kitchen, a pool table and a putting green.The growth has made Kensho worth hundreds of millions of dollars and turned Nadler into a millionaire many times over, at least when his stake in the company is taken into account. But it\u2019s not clear how beneficial his company will be to the American labor market as a whole. Back when I first met Nadler, for a lunch last summer, he wasn\u2019t too proud to admit this. \u2018\u2018The cynical answer that another tech entrepreneur would give you is that we\u2019re creating new jobs, we\u2019re creating technology jobs,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve created, on paper at least, more than a dozen millionaires.\u2018\u2018That might help people sleep better at night,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018but we are creating a very small number of high-paying jobs in return for destroying a very large number of fairly high-paying jobs, and the net-net to society, absent some sort of policy intervention or new industry that no one\u2019s thought of yet to employ all those people, is a net loss.\u2019\u2019Nathaniel Popper is a financial reporter for The Times and the author of \u2018\u2018Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding a Drug for Healthy Aging", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Given their druthers, most people would opt for a long and healthy life. Few relish the idea of spending years, even decades, incapacitated by illness, dependent on caregivers and unable to enjoy the people, places and activities that make life worth living.In 1980, Dr. James F. Fries, a Stanford University physician who studied chronic disease and aging, proposed that a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompression of morbidity\u00e2\u0080\u009d would enable most people to remain healthy until a certain age, perhaps 85, then die naturally or after only a brief illness.Now, a group of experts on aging envisions a route to realizing Dr. Fries\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal: one or more drugs that can slow the rate of aging and the development of the costly, debilitating chronic ailments that typically accompany it. If successful, not only would their approach make healthy longevity a reality for many more people, but it could also save money. They say that even a 20 percent cut in how fast people age could save more than $7 trillion over the next half-century in the United States alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAging is by far the best predictor of whether people will develop a chronic disease like atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke, cancer, dementia or osteoarthritis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. James L. Kirkland, director of the Kogod Center on Aging at the Mayo Clinic, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAging way outstrips all other risk factors.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe and fellow researchers, who call themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeroscientists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d are hardly hucksters hawking magic elixirs to extend life. Rather, they are university scientists joined together by the American Federation for Aging Research to promote a new approach to healthier aging, which may \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or may not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be accompanied by a longer life. They plan to test one or more substances that have already been studied in animals, and which show initial promise in people, in hopes of finding one that will keep more of us healthier longer.As Dr. Kirkland wrote in a new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAging: The Longevity Dividend\u00e2\u0080\u009d: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy targeting fundamental aging processes, it may be possible to delay, prevent, alleviate or treat the major age-related chronic disorders as a group instead of one at a time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis colleague S. Jay Olshansky, a gerontology specialist in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois in Chicago, said it is often counterproductive to treat one disease at a time. Preventing cardiac death, for example, can leave a person vulnerable to cancer or dementia, he explained.A better approach, Dr. Kirkland said, would be to target the processes fundamental to aging that underlie all age-related chronic diseases: chronic low-grade inflammation unrelated to infection; cellular degradation; damage to major molecules like DNA, proteins and sugars; and failure of stem cells and other progenitor cells to function properly.The team, which includes Dr. Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx, and Steven N. Austad, who heads the biology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, plans to study one promising compound, a generic drug called metformin already widely used in people with Type 2 diabetes. They will test the drug in a placebo-controlled trial involving 3,000 elderly people to see if it will delay the development or progression of a variety of age-related ailments, including heart disease, cancer and dementia. Their job now is to raise the $50 million or so needed to conduct the study for the five years they expect it will take to determine whether the concept has merit.The project represents a radical departure from ordinary drug studies that test treatments for single diseases. However, the group, spearheaded by Dr. Barzilai, said the Food and Drug Administration has endorsed their idea to test a single substance for effectiveness against a range of ailments.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf metformin turns out not to work, there are several other substances in the pipeline that could be tried,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Barzilai said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the auspices of the National Institute on Aging, three research centers have tested 16 substances in different animal models and got incredible results with four of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGreen tea, one of those tested, bestowed no health or life span benefits, despite its popularity. But the drug rapamycin, an immune modulator used following organ transplants, was most effective among those tested, Dr. Barzilai said.The team is starting with metformin because it is a cheap oral drug \u00e2\u0080\u0094 costing about two cents a pill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with six decades of safe use in people throughout the world. Among those with Type 2 diabetes who have taken it for years, there is evidence suggesting that, in addition to diabetes, it protects against cardiovascular disease, cancer and possibly cognitive impairment, Dr. Kirkland said, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit targets the fundamental processes of aging, which tend to be linked.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Barzilai said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur goal is to establish the principle of using a drug, or two in combination, to extend health span. The best we can expect from metformin is two or three additional years of healthy aging. But the next generation of drugs will be much more potent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy analyzing the action of genes that extend health span, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit should be possible to devise drugs that mimic the genes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effects,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Two such gene-based drugs that show early promise against age-related diseases are already being tested.But until definitive studies are completed and substances are shown to be safe as well as effective in prolonging health, Dr. Olshansky cautioned against dosing oneself prematurely with widely touted substances like resveratrol, the antioxidant found in red grapes and wine, or growth hormone.Consumers must exercise caution, he warned, because \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an entire industry out there trying to market the products we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re testing before they are adequately evaluated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also emphasized that taking a drug found to ward off age-related ills is not a license to abandon a healthy lifestyle. Doing so \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould completely negate the benefit of a compound that slows aging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe in \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byPart of the challenge is balancing individuals\u2019 privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism.Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He mentioned specifically the Cruz campaign\u2019s efforts to spread a rumor that Dr. Ben Carson had suspended his candidacy while Iowa voters were still caucusing. \u201cWhat he did to Ben Carson in Iowa was a disgrace,\u201d said Mr. Trump, adding it \u201caffected me, too,\u201d because he believes he lost votes in Iowa as a result.He also accused the Republican National Committee of failing to fulfill the terms of a pledge he signed not to run for president as an independent if he does not win the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThe pledge isn\u2019t being honored by the R.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Trump said, mentioning the crowds at the last two debates, where he was frequently booed. In Mount Pleasant, Mr. Trump trashed Mr. Cruz as a false Christian. \u201cThe worst is holding up a Bible all the time talking about how \u2014 you\u2019re willing to lie about anything and you hold up a Bible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m Christian, I\u2019m Protestant, I\u2019m Presbyterian to be exact.\u201d He said he was speaking out to counter ads by Mr. Cruz, who has focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s past praise for his sister, an appeals court judge, as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Mr. Trump implored the news media to help publicize his attacks on Mr. Cruz, saying it would save him money, adding, \u201cPsychologically, I like to watch my costs.\u201d In Mount Pleasant, he was more overt, saying, \u201cWho the hell wants to take out $2 million worth of commercials when I have enough cameras back there that can get the word around?\u201dWhile Mr. Trump saved most of his fire for Mr. Cruz and George W. Bush, his wrecking-ball performance smashed a few other windows, too. Jeb Bush was mocked for using an exclamation point in his campaign slogan, and, after vowing not to go after Senator Marco Rubio \u201cfor being the choke artist,\u201d Mr. Trump mocked the senator\u2019s propensity to sweat, saying that at one debate, \u201cI was standing next to Rubio, and I thought he just got out of a swimming pool.\u201d Instead of coverage of the Bushes\u2019 campaigning in South Carolina, Mr. Trump sucked up all the news media attention and interest for the afternoon with his instant command of cable news. Mr. Trump also called Mr. Cruz \u201ca basket case,\u201d and said that South Carolina voters were smart enough to understand the truth. While Mr. Trump did not bring up George W. Bush, when asked, he mocked Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d appearance during the Iraq war and pointedly said the country had not been \u201csafe\u201d during the president\u2019s tenure. \u201cYou had him on the aircraft carrier saying all sorts of wonderful things,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhat does that mean, he kept the country safe after 9/11?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that for years.\u201d Growing sharper as he talked, he said: \u201cWhat about during 9/11? I was there.\u201d He added: \u201cThe worst attack ever in this country? It was during his presidency.\u201d Praising George W. Bush for what happened after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was like saying \u201cthe team scored 19 runs in the first inning, but after that, we played pretty well,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump was pointed on the effect the former president would have on his brother\u2019s campaign: \u201cIt would be better for him if he stayed out.\u201d Mr. Trump was pressed repeatedly as to whether he was saying the former president was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Mr. Trump sought to keep pressure on George W. Bush without explicitly repeating the phrase \u201cthey lied,\u201d as he did in the debate on Saturday, referring to the Bush administration\u2019s claims of the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation struck many Republican strategists as perilous to his candidacy in a military-heavy state where the former president is still popular. \u201cI don\u2019t say anything,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying this \u2014 if you look back at your records, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s tremendous information and the C.I.A. and various other agencies were not talking and they were not getting along and there were a lot of personality conflicts and they all hated each other and we ended up with the World Trade Center, O.K?\u201d Pressed again about whether he was faulting Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump said, \u201cNo, I think we could have had greater vigilance, but I would never say anybody was responsible for that.\u201d Mr. Trump, meanwhile, insisted he had the right credentials to deal with the rigors of campaigning in a state in which nastiness is par for the course. \u201cI\u2019ve won many club championships \u2014 you have to deal with pressure,\u201d said the real estate and golf course developer.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Egyptian Military Calls Toddler\u2019s Life Sentence for Murder a Mistake", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 As alibis go, this one would seem to be airtight: Your honor, my client was only a year old at the time of the crime.But it did not stop an Egyptian military court from convicting the accused, a boy now 3 \u00bd, of killing three people, carrying guns and firebombs, blocking a road with burning tires, and trying to damage government buildings \u2014 and sentencing him to life in prison.But that, too, may be a mistake: Before the military statement, a police spokesman, Abu Bakr Abdel-Karim, said in a television interview that the wanted culprit was the toddler\u2019s uncle, a 51-year-old man who has a similar name.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Abdel-Karim said the reason for the mix-up remained unknown. \u201cI don\u2019t know why there is a contradiction between the statements,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the one responsible for communication with the army.\u201dA military spokesman, Mohammed Samir, refused to comment.The case shed a stark light on the often dysfunctional Egyptian judiciary, which since 2013 has sentenced hundreds of people to death or to life in prison in mass trials on what human rights advocacy groups have called trumped-up charges. Ahmed\u2019s conviction was for crimes allegedly committed by supporters of Mr. Morsi in January 2014.The army\u2019s announcements about the case of mistaken identity have not included any apology for the distress caused to the child\u2019s family, which was evident in an appearance the boy and his father made on one of Egypt\u2019s most-watched talk shows.\u201cI swear I don\u2019t want to upset anyone,\u201d the father, Mansour Qorani Sharara, said through sobs as he held the boy and pleaded for help. \u201cThey told me they will take my child. No one will take my child.\u201dThe show\u2019s host, Wael el-Ibrashy, favored the ouster of Mr. Morsi and is a prominent supporter of the current government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. But he said despondently, \u201cI don\u2019t know how people are meant to believe in justice after they see this.\u201dMr. Sharara\u2019s wife, Hemat, called in to the show to say that the police came to the family home looking for her husband and child while Mr. Sharara was on the air. Mr. Sharara had already spent four months in prison because the authorities mistook him for his son.Egypt maintains that its judiciary is independent, and the government routinely rejects all criticism of its judges or their verdicts. Even so, human rights groups say Egyptian judges comply with the government\u2019s wishes.Insulting the judiciary is a crime in Egypt, and many people have been convicted of the charge in recent years.The judiciary came under fire this week after a Cairo court sentenced an author, Ahmed Nagy, to two years in prison for publishing an excerpt from his novel, which contained sexually explicit details and drug scenes, in a magazine.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of Ahmed\u2019s father. He is Mansour Qorani Sharara, not Sharer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Rallies Large Crowd in Boston Before the Primary", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "BOSTON \u2014 A buoyant Hillary Clinton plunged into the crowd here after a barnstorming speech, posing for selfies and shaking hands on the eve of what she hopes will be a pivotal victory in the 11 states, including Massachusetts, that hold Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday.Polls show Mrs. Clinton with an edge in Massachusetts, which many analysts say is a must-win for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sensing that the nomination may be within her grasp, Mrs. Clinton seemed eager here to bring the fight to the Republicans.

{"Headline": "European Privacy Regulators Want Details on \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe move by the privacy regulators, which represent individual countries within the 28-nation European Union, indicates an unwillingness to accept the word of officials in Brussels that they can adequately safeguard citizens\u2019 personal data.The primary concern is how much access American intelligence agencies will have to European citizens\u2019 personal information.Europe\u2019s privacy regulators set a Feb. 29 deadline for receiving the new information. If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans\u2019 privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate \u2014 and potentially fine \u2014 companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.These uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal \u2014 known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region\u2019s privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.\u201cI am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe\u2019s negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, \u201cthe current situation isn\u2019t ideal.\u201dThe main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans\u2019 data when it is transferred to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standardsSome of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others \u2014 particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters \u2014 have said they favored the current data transfer approach.This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies\u2019 activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world\u2019s largest economies.\u201cBusinesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,\u201d said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesday\u2019s developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a big concern about this agreement,\u201d said Estelle Mass\u00e9, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. \u201cWill it hold up in court?\u201dComplicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe\u2019s tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens\u2019 digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe\u2019s data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.\u201cHalf a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still expect that cool heads will prevail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 2014, after federal officials tried to confiscate Mr. Bundy\u2019s cattle, professed militiamen flocked to his ranch in Bunkerville, Nev., to face down the authorities. When the agents retreated, Mr. Bundy hailed it as a victory for those angered by federal regulation, and he has been seen as a hero by the Oregon occupiers and by people sympathetic to their cause.Cliven Bundy\u2019s lawyer, Michael Arnold, said his client had been arrested at the Portland airport and would face a felony charge of conspiracy to impede officers of the United States from discharging their official duties, in connection with the 2014 standoff.Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, about six hours from Portland, was taken over by a small band of armed militants on Jan. 2. They demanded that two local ranchers, imprisoned on arson charges for a fire that spread to public lands, be released, and that federal lands that the occupiers said were improperly taken from local ranchers in decades past be returned to local or private control.On Wednesday, the F.B.I. said in a statement, one of the occupiers rode an all-terrain vehicle outside the barricades at the refuge. Agents tried to approach the driver, the statement said, and he returned to the encampment at the refuge at high speed.Law enforcement officers then moved to contain the remaining occupiers by placing agents at barricades immediately ahead of and behind the area where the occupiers were camping.\u201cIt has never been the F.B.I.\u2019s desire to engage these armed occupiers in any way other than through dialogue, and to that end, the F.B.I. has negotiated with patience and restraint in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully,\u201d Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge of the F.B.I. in Oregon, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we reached a point where it became necessary to take action in a way that best ensured the safety of those on the refuge, the law enforcement officers who are on scene, and the people of Harney County who live and work in this area.\u201dLater, Michele Fiore, a Nevada assemblywoman who has expressed sympathy for the occupiers, got on the phone with the four holdouts, as did an F.B.I. negotiator the occupiers called Mark.Mark was on the phone only briefly. And Ms. Fiore spoke on the live stream to the occupiers, promising them that she was on her way to help negotiate their exit.Ms. Fiore encouraged the group to remain calm, put down their weapons and leave the refuge. \u201cWe don\u2019t need our weapons right now,\u201d she said, adding that the F.B.I. would not fire on the occupiers. \u201cThe world is watching.\u201dMs. Fiore, who is running for Congress from Nevada, transformed during the course of the live stream from an aspiring negotiator to something closer to a counselor, telling the panicked occupiers to remain calm, leading them in prayer and encouraging them to disarm.At another point, she encouraged them to invest in the political process, telling them, \u201cWe need your voice on a committee.\u201dThe occupiers were unconvinced. Voices intermittently screamed in the background, \u201cThey don\u2019t care.\u201dLate Wednesday, the occupiers said they would be willing to turn themselves in accompanied by Ms. Fiore and the evangelist Franklin Graham.On Thursday morning, Mr. Graham said he would travel to Oregon to try to mediate.\u201cLast night I was on the phone with them for several hours, was able to have prayer with them, and they have said they would come out today,\u201d Mr. Graham said in a statement on his Facebook page. \u201cI am on my way there and hope to be there by 7:00 a.m. their time.\u201dMr. Graham\u2019s involvement appeared to be unfolding rapidly.

It was a seeming change of tack for Mr. Trump, who has rarely missed a chance to tell a crowd how well he was doing, or how poorly his opponents were faring, in the polls.But, for 45 minutes at a rally at Great Bay Community College, he did not mention his poll numbers. He did not attack or mention Mr. Cruz or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who came in third in Iowa. And his campaign added three smaller, more retail politics events to his Thursday and Friday schedules in addition to the large rallies he typically favors (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done five of these today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he hoarsely told the crowd).

{"Headline": "What Microsoft\u2019s Xamarin Purchase Says About the Cloud Computing Fight", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Microsoft announced on Wednesday that it was buying Xamarin, a company that helps software developers write applications for mobile devices. The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million.It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years.A.W.S., Google and Microsoft\u2019s Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there.Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries.Developers \u201ccan choose any cloud\u201d in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added \u201cyou\u2019ll see a deep integration with Azure,\u201d including features that won\u2019t be available in competing clouds.In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others.It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity.\u201cWe see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, \u201cevery enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers.\u201dThat idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used.\u201cThe customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,\u201d said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. \u201cThey all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Accuses Hillary Clinton of Copying His Message", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Though the Vermont senator has repeatedly said he wants to avoid a negative campaign, Mr. Sanders delivered one of his most striking critiques of Mrs. Clinton yet, accusing her of mirroring his style and highlighting their differences on the campaign finance system and trade policies. The comments come as Mr. Sanders is fighting to prove he can remain viable in the race, which will mean broadening his support beyond the thousands of young people and working-class whites that pack his events.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to say that I am delighted that Secretary Clinton, month after month after month, seems to be adopting more and more of the positions that we have advocated. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, adding that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cbeginning to use a lot of the language and phraseology that we have used.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, I think I saw a TV ad and thought it was me. But it turned out it was Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture in the end,\u201d Mr. Sanders said at a news conference at an ironworkers union office in Boston.Mr. Sanders went on to imply that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stances on issues were not as genuine as his own.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the people of Massachusetts and the people of the United States need to know the difference between hastily adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and long-held ideas of the candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders has said that the Iowa caucuses, where Mrs. Clinton narrowly beat him, and the New Hampshire primary, where Mr. Sanders won by double digits, proves that his message of a rigged economy is resonating with voters. However, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday delivered a blow to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s momentum and raised questions about how much longer he can remain in the race.Without directly accusing Mrs. Clinton of being influenced by Wall Street money, Mr. Sanders pointed out that Priorities USA Action, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d that is supporting Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign, raised $25 million during the last reporting period from special interest groups, including $15 million from Wall Street.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I know that every candidate who has ever received special interest money always says that the millions and millions of dollars they have received will never influence them. Never, never, never,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the American people need to ask a very simple question: If these contributions from Wall Street and other powerful special interests have no influence over the candidate, why are these special interests making huge campaign contributions?\u201d\u201cSimple question. Now maybe they are dummies. And maybe they just think they throw millions of dollars and expect to get nothing. Maybe. I doubt that very much.\u201dOn Tuesday morning, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign responded to Mr. Sanders\u2019s attacks.\u201cHow revolutionary: after a loss in Nevada and facing an uphill climb in South Carolina, Bernie Sanders is breaking his campaign pledge once again to trot out old, tired attacks on Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Christina Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Marco Rubio Sees Bounce in Latest New Hampshire Poll", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "SALEM, N.H. \u2014 One of the most respected surveys of New Hampshire voters confirmed on Thursday that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has quickly become the candidate to beat in the state\u2019s primary on Tuesday, a sudden rise that has reordered the Republican primary race and unnerved his rivals.Donald J. Trump remained in first at 29 percent, unchanged since the university\u2019s last survey in late January. But, most significant for Mr. Rubio, he remained ahead of the candidates who pose the biggest competition for him in New Hampshire. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, were bunched together at 13 percent, 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has taunted Mr. Rubio for the last two days by calling him the \u201cboy in the bubble\u201d for taking fewer questions from voters and reporters than many of his rivals, saw his support all but collapse. He now stands at 4 percent, down from 9 percent in the last survey. Some of the voter interviews were conducted before the Iowa caucuses. For them, the poll\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus 5.2 percentage points; for interviews done after the caucuses, it was 6.8 percentage points. That means the results may not portray as big an increase or a decrease for any candidate.On the campaign trail on Thursday, Mr. Rubio was visibly upbeat. Speaking to around 700 voters in Salem, N.H., who had packed a school cafeteria and spilled into the gym, the Florida senator brought his wife, two sons and two daughters up on stage with him and joked as how being from Miami they were excited for a coming snowstorm, even if people in New Hampshire were not. Then he made a self-effacing pander: If the people of New Hampshire were against snow, \u201cI am against snow,\u201d he said, drawing laughs from the audience.He urged them to get behind his campaign for the sake of Republican unity, saying that Democrats wanted the G.O.P. to be at war with itself heading into the general election. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to have a very spirited primary. Believe me, I know,\u201d he said, referring to attacks from Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie. \u201cThey want us to remain divided, right up to November.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Book of Memory,\u2019 by Petina Gappah", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.With the advent of social media, forgetting can seem like an obsolete danger: Facebook timelines and chat logs have externalized the burden of remembering. But a different and more pernicious kind of forgetfulness looms in Petina Gappah\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Book of Memory,\u201d whose narrator grapples with the threat of \u00aderasure.The none-too-subtly named Memory, an albino woman imprisoned in a bleak Zimbabwean prison, is convicted of the murder of Lloyd, a wealthy white professor. As she awaits the results of her appeal, she pieces her fragmented childhood recollections into a tentative, jumbled \u00adautobiography. But the events she recalls resist interpretation, and she is left to make sense of scenes she can neither forget nor explain.Memory\u2019s relationship with Lloyd is the mystery at the heart of the story. Though the prison guards assume Lloyd was Memory\u2019s lover, Memory insists that he was a sort of adoptive parent. Under his care, she grew up in luxury at Summer Madness, a sprawling estate across town from the impoverished neighborhood where she lived with her parents and siblings until the age of 9.Memory remembers \u2014 or thinks she remembers \u2014 passing into Lloyd\u2019s hands when he bought her from her parents. Like so much of her past, this foggily recalled transaction went undocumented: There are no written records, no photographs. Memory\u2019s family, along with her life at Summer Madness, seem \u201cto have emerged complete into the present, without a history.\u201d In stark contrast, she no\u00adtices that Lloyd\u2019s past \u2014 and the history of the British in Zimbabwe \u2014 is thoroughly recorded.Memory is not even bound to her childhood home by the tenuous links of physical likeness: In her community, color is defining, and her albino tone is socially illegible. As a child, she \u201cnoted obsessively the different shades\u201d of her family members\u2019 skin. Her preoccupation is not an isolated phenomenon but rather a national fixation shared by her mother and female neighbors. In this color-conscious culture, Memory is an enigma \u2014 \u201ca ghost against the others,\u201d more specter than body.\u201cLike the peppered moth,\u201d she writes, \u201cI adapted to my changing environments\u201d without laying any lasting claim to them. \u201cThe Book of Memory\u201d is an attempt to reclaim, by way of reconstruction, a genealogy both personal and cultural, an exercise in self-searching that upends many of Memory\u2019s most deeply entrenched conceptions about herself and her origins.But these scant philosophical forays are the most nuanced part of a novel propelled almost exclusively by cheap suspense. Its tone, which is self-consciously literary, and its plot, which treats us to the standard bouts of amorous obsession and familial turmoil, are flavorless fare with little lasting force. Gappah\u2019s story collection, \u201cAn Elegy for Easterly,\u201d won the Guardian First Book Award, but the partial revelations in this work are short-lived enticements that satisfy few of our deeper narrative appetites.\u201cThe Book of Memory\u201d contains all the elements of made-to-order profundity, copied from the familiar templates: the depressive mother; the isolated, bookish protagonist, scarred by her fraught past; the inoffensively experimental prose. Its characters, a motley crew who practically scream \u201ctroubled,\u201d are themes unconvincingly personified. \u201cI longed to be like all the others. I tried to get as dark as the other children. I longed to belong,\u201d Memory clarifies, as if we could\u2019ve missed it. Gappah describes rather than animates, dragging her ensemble from chapter to chapter without allowing its players to move of their own accord.\u201cI do not mean to sound like I am writing a self-help manual, but your mind truly is the only thing you can control when you are in prison,\u201d Memory muses. But like a self-help manual, Gappah\u2019s book cloaks its aphoristic abstractions in the trappings of shallow lyricism, hoping that we might mercifully mistake melodrama for substance.THE BOOK OF MEMORYBy Petina Gappah276 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.Becca Rothfeld is a freelance critic and a master\u2019s student at the University of \u00adCambridge.Advertisement"}

The attack was the latest in more than four months of violence, and it came as senior Israeli officials clashed over the degree of force to be used against Palestinian minors wielding knives.Palestinians using guns, knives and vehicles as weapons have killed at least 28 Israelis since Oct 1. Israeli forces have killed at least 160 Palestinians during the same period, as many as two-thirds of them assailants, according to the Israeli authorities. The others died in clashes with Israeli security forces.The Israeli military identified the off-duty soldier who was killed on Thursday as Sgt. Tuvia (Yanai) Wiessman, 21, a resident of a nearby Jewish settlement, Maale Mikhmas. The Palestinian news media identified the assailants as Ayham Bassam Ibrahim Subih and Omar Salim Rimawi, residents of Beituniya, a Palestinian town on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Ramallah.The attack took place in the aisles of the Rami Levy supermarket in an Israeli-run industrial zone in the Ramallah area. Two Israeli civilians described on Israeli television how they had used their personal weapons to shoot the assailants.As Israel has grappled with the recent wave of violence, Palestinian officials, human rights organizations and some international leaders have accused the Israeli military and police of using excessive force. Critics have accused Israeli forces of shooting to kill, including some instances, captured on video, in which the assailants no longer appeared to be posing a mortal threat.Israeli leaders have vehemently denied those charges, praising the forces \u2014 and occasionally, armed guards and civilians \u2014 for acting effectively and in legitimate self-defense.But speaking to high school students on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, urged caution and restraint. The military, he said, \u201cmust not speak in catchphrases such as \u2018whoever comes to slay you, slay him first,\u2019 or state that anyone holding a knife or a pair of scissors must be killed.\u201d His remarks implied criticism of some Israeli politicians who have said that Palestinian assailants who attack Jews should know that they will not emerge alive.General Eisenkot added: \u201cThere were places where a 13-year-old girl was holding a pair of scissors or a knife, and there was a barricade between her and the troops. I wouldn\u2019t want a soldier to open fire and empty a magazine on a girl like that, even if she\u2019s doing something extremely serious. You have to exercise the correct amount of force necessary to carry out the mission.\u201dIsrael\u2019s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, gave his backing to General Eisenkot after some right-wing politicians criticized his remarks.

{"Headline": "Fordham Prep Rattled by 2 Students\u2019 Suicides", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday, students described the mood among their classmates and teachers as shellshocked, as the school marshaled resources to provide counseling to grieving students and reassurance to worried parents.Michael Park, 16, a junior, said his religion teacher had talked in class about the idea of \u201ccopycat suicide,\u201d saying that sometimes news of a suicide can inspire people who are depressed to see killing themselves as an option, and encouraged students to seek help if they were having such thoughts.Through a spokeswoman, Fordham Prep\u2019s president, the Rev. Christopher J. Devron, said that after the first death, the school set up a counseling center for students and held a meeting for faculty members, led by the school\u2019s counselors, to help teachers recognize signs of emotional distress.Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North, said that, for now, the agency was posting police officers on the platforms of stations serving Fordham Prep students when they were coming and going from school.She said the second student suicide at Fordham Prep was almost certainly an instance of imitation, with the deaths so close in time and in the same manner being \u201cmore than just a coincidence.\u201dBut Fordham Prep is known for a relatively relaxed atmosphere and the lifelong friendships that form there. Students refer to it affectionately as Holiday Prep for the abundance of days off, and alumni describe their classmates as brothers.On Tuesday, Fordham Prep extended the typical morning meeting in which students gather in small groups with their faculty mentors.The teachers told those who had not already heard about the second student\u2019s death, Father Devron said, and spoke about the preciousness of life, students said. Students said the teachers noted that guidance counselors would be stationed in the library each day for most of the next month to talk.After school on Tuesday, as some students ran to catch a train at the Botanical Garden station, others described themselves as frightened and confused by the events.Andrew Ohakum, 17, a senior, said students had emerged from the morning meetings in shock.\u201cIt was almost complete silence,\u201d he said of the hallways. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201dAnother student, who declined to give his name, said he could not make sense of the suicides.\u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on; I don\u2019t know why this is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to keep everyone in our prayers.\u201dMr. Kelly, who lived in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., played hockey and was a counselor-in-training at Camp Shankitunk in Delhi, N.Y., according to an obituary.Anshuman Konuru, a 2015 graduate who is now a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania, said that he had known Mr. Kelly since elementary school and that they had often ridden the train together, though he had not talked with him since he graduated.\u201cFrom what I saw, he was a really great kid, and he was always so happy, and always had a smile on his face,\u201d he said.Mr. Konuru said his Facebook feed was full of expressions of shock and grief from his classmates, many of whom had changed their profile pictures to the Fordham Prep logo to show solidarity with the school. He said everyone was bewildered and anxious.\u201cWe were there for four years, and we hadn\u2019t heard of anything happening like this at our school,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re worried about how the Fordham community will regroup after this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to deal with.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Living With Cancer: A Woman Like Me", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "A clip from \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Woman Like Me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSusan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.We commonly assume that cancer afflicts the aging or aged, but approximately 16 percent of breast cancer deaths involve women under the age of 50.  How can or should an alarming death sentence be confronted in midlife?  The personal challenges posed by incurable disease unfold in an absorbing documentary about movie-making, \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d which opened in New York in October and became available on Netflix this January.The co-directors of \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d Alex Sichel and Elizabeth Giamatti, consider the roles played by temperament, spirituality and art as two vigorous women attempt to reconcile themselves to a terminal prognosis. The film portrays Ms. Sichel confronting metastatic breast cancer by making two movies.  The first is a documentary of herself in the hospital with medical personnel and at home with her family.  Ms. Sichel, who received the diagnosis just before her daughter started kindergarten, is shown dealing with her ambivalence about the traditional therapies she undertakes.  Her parents, sisters and husband struggle on camera with their ambivalence about the holistic therapies she also undertakes.    Braided with the documentary, the second movie Ms. Sichel makes is fictional: The actress Lili Taylor plays a buoyant alter ego, Anna, who must respond to the same dire diagnosis. The fictional narrative of \u201cA Woman Like Me\u201d centers on a happier version of Alex Sichel so she can watch someone stepping lightly through her fraught terrain. For example, Anna sits with a friend in a restaurant and interrogates the waitress.  Is there dairy in the vegetarian dish? Are there gluten-free options?  Her friend orders the cavatelli, Anna steamed kale without salt.  After a pause, though, she changes her mind; she will have the cavatelli as well as a glass of Cabernet.  In the near future, she says, she does not want to look back on \u00e2\u0080\u009cpointless good behavior.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn contrast, Ms. Sichel presents herself in a series of tortured conversations with a variety of advisers as she hurtles between fear and hope on an emotional roller coaster. She visits a meditation center and consults a Buddhist teacher, but equanimity often eludes her.  Intermittently sad and angry, yet terrified of dying angry, she tries to find serene memories, only to recall her sorrow at her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, whereas Anna remembers her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooking.\u201cA Woman Like Me\u201d hints that some people may be endowed with a disposition that facilitates their making peace with their imminent demise, although maybe those people exist only in fiction.  Yet both stormy Alex and sunny Anna try to learn how to acknowledge their looming mortality.  In especially poignant scenes, Alex and Anna must come to terms with their grief at losing their young children and also with their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future grief at losing them.Anna copes with cancer most dramatically when she rehearses her death with her husband.  Enlisting his help, she promises to refrain from moaning, but wants to know what his final words to her will be.  And then she encourages him to drape a white sheet over her head.  Anna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directing the scene with her husband tells us something about Alex Sichel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to spend the last year of her life co-directing a movie.Like Anna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rehearsing, Ms. Sichel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie-making is a testament to creativity and to the multiplicity of the self.  Ms. Sichel refutes what cancer will inevitably make of her by imagining what she makes of it.  In \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d she offers a defense of cancer art as a way of envisioning and practicing mortality.  Throughout the film she espouses the efficacy of Buddhism, but the creator of Anna provides us proof of the value of story-telling.If Alex Sichel could not become a sunnier person, she could envision herself being one. Through this endeavor, she and her co-director, Ms. Giamatti, illuminate what it means to live with incurable cancer not, as Ms. Giamatti put it during a phone conversation, in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalcion or Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d manner, but in all its messy and contradictory intensity.After watching the movie, I was upset at learning that Ms. Sichel died on June 23, 2014, at the age of 50, and then I was surprised at my distress since the end of the film makes it abundantly clear that she was suffering advanced disease.  Yet somehow I could not believe that this engaged and engaging woman was dead. My reaction also testifies to the power of art, for Alex Sichel and her double Anna continue to touch and instruct people like me by showing us characters like ourselves.  If we cannot attain complete and lasting tranquility in the face of a death sentence, we can nevertheless conceive of a series of precarious, provisional moments of acceptance.  Story-telling serves not as an escape from the reality of disease but as an assertion of the self against what will eventually happen.Terrible as cancer is, it has prompted people to produce astonishing art. The power of this meta-movie resides not in retrospective platitudes about women with metastatic disease but in its representations of their urgent exertions to imagine the unimaginable.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "From \u2018Je Suis Charlie\u2019 to Attacks on Free Speech", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialAfter the murderous attack on the offices of the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d became a rallying cry in France and across much of Europe in support of free speech and freedom of expression. It is a sad and depressing sequel to that display of solidarity that so many European nations seem willing today to curtail those same freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.These are not isolated cases, but the problem they point to is not simply one of misguided laws. The rise of international terrorist organizations and the ability of the terrorists to recruit and indoctrinate via the Internet and social media have created an indisputable threat to democratic societies, one that tests traditional boundaries between security and freedoms.Even in the United States, where the Constitution proclaims that freedom of speech may be curbed only if it poses a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d there is a legitimate debate about what this means in the context of the sort of horrific propaganda that ISIS has spread. In Europe, limits on what can be said or done in specific categories are not uncommon, such as laws in more than a dozen European nations that ban denial of the Holocaust.On the contrary, what is foolish is the rush to exploit fear and crisis to suppress the freedoms that define democracy \u2014 the very freedoms Charlie Hebdo stood for and its attackers sought to undermine. There is no question that terrorism requires a robust response, but it cannot be used as justification for arbitrary and unfair laws.Advertisement"}

As it happens, Mr. Cruz voted for the same legislation, but later reversed course when it came up for a second vote.Mr. Harris, the Rubio adviser, called it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most egregious example\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign style, which he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cphony\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeceitful.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harris then analyzed the image in clinical detail.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not Marco Rubio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harris said, pointing to the image of Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, which appears to have been somewhat sloppily superimposed over another man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis person, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who this is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they Photoshopped Marco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face onto this body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harris said.Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign did not deny that the image was altered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo days before the presidential primary in South Carolina, they want to talk about a picture we used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a top Cruz aide, Rick Tyler, told CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Rubio has a better picture of him shaking hands with Barack Obama, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to swap it out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.The episode did not end at the rally. About an hour later, at another Rubio campaign rally in Anderson, S.C., Mr. Harris raised the topic again, by showing reporters what he said was the original image of a white man shaking the hand of a black man. Several details from the image matched up identically with those in the picture from the Cruz-sponsored website.Mr. Harris said that Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, Jeanette, had done some online sleuthing and found the original image.

{"Headline": "Facebook Loses a Battle in India Over Its Free Basics Program", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, Mark Zuckerberg has had a grander vision than just connecting the more than one billion people who already use Facebook: He wants to connect the entire world.That effort hit a major roadblock on Monday, when Indian regulators banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others.Free Basics offers people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet.Even with that noble aim, Facebook miscalculated in introducing the program in India. While Facebook expected to be welcomed with open arms, its message to the country focused on itself rather than the broad coalition of telecommunications firms supporting the effort, experts said. That, in turn, fostered a climate of distrust about Facebook\u2019s future intentions in the country and led to the questions from regulators.India\u2019s decision also puts Facebook in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality. Yet the Indian regulators\u2019 ruling, which furthers net neutrality, puts Facebook in a losing position.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s stumble in bringing his signature project to India underscores the difficulties of widening Internet access to the world at large, which companies like Google and Xiaomi of China also are trying. While there is enormous potential upside in offering web services to hundreds of millions of people who are currently not digitally connected, regulators and local officials have proved much more difficult to navigate than these tech companies anticipated.\u201dThere has been such a great deal of spotlight on a single Internet issue,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, editor and publisher of MediaNama, an Indian news site, who has strongly opposed Facebook\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think Internet policy in India will ever again be made in a vacuum, a black box.\u201dFree Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the world\u2019s tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative.In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment.Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking. Locals were wary of the company\u2019s unknown long-term plans for advertising or other parts of Facebook\u2019s business.\u201cThe phrase \u2018no free lunch\u2019 translates pretty well into a lot of different languages,\u201d said Josh Levy, an advocacy director for Access Now, an international digital rights organization.The issue of these Internet services has been debated in other countries, including the United States, where the Federal Communications Commission is studying whether zero-rated services comply with its own net neutrality rules.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which announced the new regulations on Monday, said in its policy document that mobile phone companies should not be allowed to \u201cshape the users\u2019 Internet experience\u201d by providing free access only to certain services.Since most Indians are not yet online, the agency noted, such programs have great power to shape a newcomer\u2019s whole view of the Internet.\u201cWhat we want is for everyone in the world to get access to the same Internet,\u201d said Mr. Pahwa of MediaNama. \u201cThe Internet is not just a collection of 130 websites. We don\u2019t want to be forced to make a choice between access and net neutrality.\u201dThe Cellular Operators Association of India said it was disappointed with the decision. The regulations \u201cconstitutes a welfare-reducing measure of high concern by blocking a possible avenue for our less advantaged citizens to move to increased economic growth and prosperity by harnessing the power of the Internet,\u201d said Rajan S. Mathews, director general of the group.In a post to his personal Facebook page on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg also pushed back. \u201cConnecting India is an important goal we won\u2019t give up on, because more than a billion people in India don\u2019t have access to the Internet,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWe know that connecting them can help lift people out of poverty, create millions of jobs and spread education opportunities.

She will literally do something until she drops.\u201d\u201cI always say it\u2019s better if we\u2019re on the same team,\u201d he added.Mr. Conran creates the kinetic, computer-generated prints in the collection. But as Ms. Rocha confided: \u201cEven when we design, we\u2019ll show something to each other and discover we\u2019ve been thinking, designing and drawing in the same way. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cute or sickening.\u201dThey met in New York at a friend\u2019s party, Ms. Rocha making her entrance fresh from a gala wearing an emerald green evening gown. \u201cI thought: \u2018Who is this girl? She\u2019s so overdressed,\u2019\u201d Mr. Conran recalled. \u201cShe literally thinks she\u2019s a princess.\u201dMs. Rocha was anything but princess-y at Spin in a Co & Co top and jeans, her garb a splashily colorful contrast to Mr. Conran\u2019s dark Balmain jacket and Rag & Bone jeans.

{"Headline": "Tennis Umpire Suspended for Corruption Worked at U.S. Open", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byIn a statement, the United States Tennis Association, which operates the Open, attributed the extraordinary situation to \u201ca flaw in our process\u201d and explained that Pitner had picked up his credential before the U.S.T.A. received notification of the suspension.Pitner\u2019s ability to continue officiating while suspended only makes the need for reform and greater cooperation and communication within tennis more evident, officials acknowledged.\u201cWe are working closely together, and we are doing everything we can, but we\u2019ve got to communicate on an ongoing basis in a better way than we have,\u201d David Haggerty, president of the International Tennis Federation, said in a telephone interview from London on Friday. \u201cI think everyone has good intentions, but now we\u2019ve got to connect the dots and make sure the process is in place to do what we need to do to make sure tennis is clean.\u201dPitner was suspended under the I.T.F. code of conduct for officials after an investigation by the sport\u2019s internal watchdog, the Tennis Integrity Unit. According to the I.T.F., Pitner\u2019s certification was suspended on Aug. 1, 2015, for 12 months for \u201csending information on the physical well-being of a player to a coach during a tournament and regularly logging on to a betting account from which bets were placed on tennis matches.\u201dThe U.S.T.A. said it was notified on Aug. 24, the day before the qualifying tournament for the Open began, that Pitner had been placed on the \u201cdo not credential\u201d list. It remains unclear why I.T.F. officials in New York took no apparent note of the suspended Pitner\u2019s presence.It remains unclear how many matches Pitner worked at the Open, but the U.S.T.A. said he had served as a linesman from the qualifying tournament through Sept. 10. The I.T.F. changed the rules governing the code of conduct for officials for 2016 and is now required to announce such suspensions. But it was not expressly forbidden to announce them in 2015; based on legal advice, the federation chose not to immediately disclose the penalties against Pitner and Parfenov.If Pitner\u2019s suspension had been announced publicly, the chances that the U.S.T.A. would have mistakenly allowed him to keep his credential would have been reduced.\u201cWhen you create an integrity protection capability, but make it work in secret, with opaque procedures and reporting, this type of fundamental error normally proliferates through ignorance or stupidity, not malice,\u201d said Chris Eaton, executive director for sport integrity at the International Center for Sport Security. \u201cIt is certain the tennis authorities at the U.S. Open had no knowledge of the umpire\u2019s suspension. But if you extrapolate this error into the field of public criminality, the public would rightly be up in arms.\u201cThere is now a regular litany of integrity breaches in tennis,\u201d Eaton added, \u201cand the progressive vulnerability and nature of these breaches have been enhanced, not prevented, by the resource-deprived, policy-shackled nature of the secretive Tennis Integrity Unit.\u201dGordon A. Smith, the chief operating officer and executive director of the U.S.T.A., acknowledged the need for a more open flow of information.\u201cLook, I think the new watchword for tennis is transparency,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt about that. We\u2019ve always had to balance confidentiality and putting names out there when there\u2019s not evidence, but you can overdo that and people can think, Well, you\u2019re not doing anything, when in fact we\u2019re doing a lot. So there\u2019s a balance, and we need to make people understand that our interest is in the integrity of the sport.\u201dPitner also worked at other events after his suspension, including the ATP event in Doha, Qatar, in January, where he was a linesman. That occurred despite the ATP\u2019s confirming that Pitner had been placed on a \u201cno credentials\u201d list.\u201cIt appears that a breach in procedures has meant that Mr. Pitner did serve as a line judge at this year\u2019s ATP event in Doha,\u201d the ATP said in a statement. \u201cThe ATP is reviewing this issue with immediate effect to ensure that no further breaches take place at any future ATP events.\u201dThe I.T.F. said that after reviewing records, it had determined that Pitner also worked as a chair umpire at an amateur seniors event in Umag, Croatia, in September.Haggerty said the I.T.F. was reviewing Pitner\u2019s one-year suspension in light of the fact that he had continued to work since the suspension was imposed.\u201cI can clearly tell you that going forward, every suspension of an official for corruption, for integrity issues will be made public and circulated to all of our partners to make sure everyone understands when someone is suspended and should not be used for officiating,\u201d Haggerty said.Pitner could not be reached for comment, but Igor Rajkovic, a media officer for the Croatian Tennis Association, said by telephone on Friday that Pitner had told Croatian tennis officials he did not want to speak with reporters.Unlike a chair umpire, a linesman has limited ability to affect the outcome of a match, particularly on a court with electronic line-calling. But accredited officials, through their proximity to players and coaches, could have access to inside information on form or on injuries that would be useful to gamblers.In its statement on the Pitner incident, the U.S.T.A. said it \u201ctakes this matter extremely seriously and has made the investigation of what caused the error its highest priority, and will work with the newly created Independent Review Panel to ensure instances such as this are not repeated in the future.\u201dSmith said he believed safeguards could quickly be put in place.\u201cIt\u2019s so unusual to have a person who is banned from officiating on the eve of the U.S. Open after his credential is already issued,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a process to make sure that whenever we get a name, whether it\u2019s at the last minute or not, we go back and ensure that they haven\u2019t already been issued a credential. It was an honest mistake, but I think that\u2019s an easy fix to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton hold commanding leads in South Carolina ahead of the primary election there, according to a poll released Tuesday.The poll shows Mr. Trump\u2019s support remaining steady in South Carolina since October, while Mr. Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses and performed well in New Hampshire, is on the rise. The Republican primary is on Saturday. Republicans by far see Mr. Trump as the strongest candidate to handle the economy, illegal immigration and fighting terrorism. They also see him as the most likely to win in a general election. On social issues and foreign policy, Mr. Trump holds only slim leads over Mr. Cruz. Mr. Trump has been facing attacks in recent days as his rivals look to blunt his momentum. The vitriol between him and Mr. Cruz has been especially pitched, as the Texas senator has sought to portray Mr. Trump as a fake Republican while Mr. Trump has questioned Mr. Cruz\u2019s mental stability.On the other side, 56 percent of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina support Mrs. Clinton, compared with 38 percent who back Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mrs. Clinton wins handily on all issues, with vast advantages on health care policy and race relations. Mr. Sanders does manage to keep it close on gun policy, an issue that some Democrats say he has been weak on.  With Democrats holding their South Carolina primary on Feb. 27, Mr. Sanders has just over 10 days to narrow the gap with Mrs. Clinton.

It would be very hard, he said, for the Clinton campaign to knock Mr. Sanders off of a message that was drawing such enthusiastic support. That said, he acknowledged that there was a threshold of negativity from the Clinton campaign that would force the Sanders campaign to respond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we are going to try and avoid making that happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor now, anyway.

The unseasonable weather probably dampened spending for utilities as well.Automakers on Tuesday are scheduled to report sales of new vehicles in the United States for January. While the pace of sales was brisk for most of the month, overall industry volumes were probably curtailed by the effects of severe weather in the Northeast and Southern states.Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP will report their quarterly earnings starting on Tuesday, and the results are not expected to be pretty.

{"Headline": "The Last Train Before the War", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "There is a photograph of my father and grandfather, taken on Sunday, Aug. 27, 1939, at a spot overlooking the Rhine above the Lorelei Rock, where the chasm of the river tightens and the quickened flow makes a murmuring sound, which has mystical resonance for the Germans.My dad had emigrated to Canada in 1934. He was in Germany that summer visiting his parents for the first time in five years. His name was Hermann, but even his German friends called him Billy. My grandfather was Heinrich, but his Anglo-Irish wife called him Bobs.They had come out from Frankfurt, on a Sunday jaunt, in a little car that my father had borrowed from a friend. Their lives were insecure, jangled by history, and dressing well was very important to them. They always had to be perfectly tailored and groomed, as they are in the photo. Bobs ordered suits he really couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford from his English tailor in Hamburg. The American soft-collared shirt he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wearing in the picture was a present from his son, who had made a quick stop at Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue between getting off his train from Montreal and boarding the New York, a Hamburg-American liner.Five days after the photograph was taken the German Army invaded Poland and the Second World War began. When I look at the photo, it seems to me my grandfather is seeing the war coming down the river. Billy has a hand on his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, as if to reassure him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but Bobs sees what he sees. Or maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listening to the Lorelei. In some legends the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murmur is a bewitching sound made by a beautiful woman, luring men to their death in a dangerous place.Maybe she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whispering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWar.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey were Catholics, not Jews, not socialists, so not especially vulnerable. Bobs had been scolded by a febrile shopkeeper, a local Nazi Party boss, for declining to return the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGerman greeting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeil Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u009d gesture, but that was nothing compared with the insults and terror that others experienced.My grandparents had met and were married in London. They were living in a seaside villa on the Isle of Wight when World War I began in August 1914. Bobs was arrested and interned as an enemy alien for four and a half grim years, then deported. His health was shattered. Their savings were exhausted. English Quakers gave them enough money to pay for their tickets and food on the journey to Germany. Along the way their trunks of clothes and household goods were looted by French occupation troops.When they stepped off the train in Frankfurt in January 1919, neither my grandmother nor my father spoke a word of German. She never learned, but Billy taught himself by reading and rereading the novels of Karl May, romantic tales of German adventurers and noble Apaches on the high plains of Texas and New Mexico. May was Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite writer. Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, too.That summer of 1939 Billy had hoped to persuade his parents to leave Germany. But applying for exit visas meant posting bonds and paying an extortionate \u00e2\u0080\u009cflight tax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with no guarantee the visa would even be granted. And my grandfather doubted that England, Ireland or Canada would welcome him, well-dressed or not, any more than they welcomed German Jews. He was a deportee. If they did let him in, he was sure to be interned if another war began.Five days after that moment on the Rhine, with the war underway, Billy received a telegram from the British consul in Cologne, warning of \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrained relations between His Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Government and Germany\u00e2\u0080\u009d and suggesting he leave the country immediately.He had booked his return on another Hamburg-American liner sailing for New York in the first week of September. But waiting that long was risky. And he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to be caught aboard a German-flagged ship if England declared war (which it did on Sept. 3). According to the Nuremberg racial laws he was a German. The Nazis wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize his British passport in time of war; he would owe the same duty to the Fatherland as anyone else. Which meant military service or a one-way ticket to Dachau.He decided to aim for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and a Holland America ship. His train from Frankfurt was oversold. The mood on the platform was near hysteria: In a few hours Britain would declare war on Germany. He said goodbye to his parents, in English. Bobs was concerned the German border police would board the train as it approached the frontier and take Billy off, but he reached Rotterdam safely. After three fraught weeks, he was able to get passage on a ship for New York. Reaching Montreal, he immediately applied for a commission in the Royal Canadian Navy. He was turned down for being \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo German.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMy father did not hear from his parents for years, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know they were still alive until a friend serving in the Canadian Army found them living in the rubble of Frankfurt in 1945.My grandparents were not Jews. Nothing else in their story probably mattered more than this: They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Jews. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bartered their English shoes and silver picture frames for potatoes, their city had fallen down around them, but they were alive.Decades later I was with my father in a hospital room in Montreal. He was dying, and slipping in and out of a coma. No one had shaved him or combed his hair in a couple of days and he wore one of those demeaning hospital johnnies. He looked pretty wild. Every now and then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start climbing out of bed. Then he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d calm down and, sounding very lucid, ask me to fetch his suit out of the closet, and his shoes, and help him get dressed, quickly. Properly dressed, because the last train was leaving for Rotterdam, and he had to get himself aboard, and across the frontier.\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfPrivate Lives: Personal essays from writers around the globe, on the news of the world and the news of individual lives. \nMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pentagon\u2019s New Parental Leave", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialSecretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced last week that women in the military would get 12 paid weeks of maternity leave in all the services, twice the amount most were previously entitled to. (The Navy last year changed its policy to give women 18 weeks of paid leave.) In addition to the change announced by Mr. Carter, which does not require legislative approval, the Pentagon intends to ask Congress to increase paid paternity leave to 14 days from 10 days.Mr. Carter\u2019s thinking on this issue was informed by talking with private businesses about their parental leave policies in an effort to make the Pentagon, which employs roughly 1.3 million troops on active duty, more family-friendly.Historically, the American military has struggled to recruit top talent during periods of low unemployment. Defense officials said that was an impetus for expanding parental leave. But Mr. Carter also wanted to move the Pentagon closer to private-sector companies with more generous parental leave policies to encourage service members to stay in the military longer. The Pentagon determined that female troops leave the military after a decade at a rate that is 30 percent higher than that of men.Beyond expanded leave, Mr. Carter announced that the Pentagon would increase child care services and establish some 3,600 rooms where new mothers could breast-feed at military installations worldwide. The Defense Department will also aim to be more flexible with employees who have compelling, family-related reasons, like medical treatment of a relative, to extend a particular assignment.Mr. Carter said that the department\u2019s research of parental leave showed that more flexible policies made good business sense. Several technology companies with which the Pentagon competes for talent, including Facebook, have recently adopted more generous leave policies.Advertisement"}

What sealed it was the watch the man is wearing; Mr. Sanders recalled owning a watch like that, Mr. Devine said.Mr. Sanders, then a 21-year-old student at the University of Chicago, was arrested on Aug. 12, 1963, while protesting segregation in Englewood, where Chicago Public Schools was planning to build a school. The video was shot by Jerry Temaner, one of the co-founders of Kartemquin Films. Mr. Sanders was charged with resisting arrest.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Fat Cats on a Diet: Will They Still Love You?", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Maya has had a tough time slimming down. After 16 months of dieting, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dropped 10 pounds and 6 ounces.True, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than 40 percent of her body weight.At her heaviest, the domestic shorthair cat tipped the scale at 24.9 pounds. She looked like a furry Pilates ball.The decision to lose weight was not Maya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; it was her owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Larissa and Doug Peluso, of Eatontown, N.J. Maya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mobility was decreasing: She could no longer jump on their bed, and they knew she might be suffering from joint pain and facing diabetes. Their vet said they had to help her regain her feline figure.Still, they hesitated.If they reduced portions, Mrs. Peluso worried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould Maya get aggressive and depressed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d With no treats to curry Maya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good graces, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe she would hate us.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMany factors contribute to weight gain in house cats. Among them is the complexity of the human-animal bond, namely how humans demonstrate love with food, and how cats learn \u00e2\u0080\u009caffectionate behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to get fed.Many owners \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree-feed\u00e2\u0080\u009d cats, letting them graze at will. But bored indoor cats, like bored indoor humans, may eat beyond satiety. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCats don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t self-regulate well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Goldstein.Concerned with the human role in feline obesity, Cornell researchers asked: If a cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food were reduced, would its behavior change? If so, how would owners translate those changes? For the study, 48 cats, each at least 25 percent over ideal weight, were put on one of three restricted diets, equal in calories. Owners answered extensive questionnaires about their cats:Before the diet, when your cat was hungry, did it beg? Meow? Pace? After feeding, did it jump in your lap? Since the diet, does your cat bat at you? Hide? Hiss? Steal food?Good news, cat owners! More than three-quarters of the cats lost weight. And though the frequency of pre-feeding behavior increased \u00e2\u0080\u0094 begging, meowing, pacing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it did not begin earlier. (Translation: The cats may have intensified owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 guilt about giving them less food, but did not protract their misery.)Better yet, owners felt that despite the restricted feeding, the cats did not turn vindictive. Instead, owners believed the cats showed more affection. After feeding, the cats would more often purr and sit in the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Beaver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut cats don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold a grudge if you limit their food.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen cats rub up against their owners throughout the day, owners like that behavior, she said, so they feel guilty and think, \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, they must want more food.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So people feel good feeding their cats and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know other ways to give them affection.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd sometimes, if cats are expecting to be fed and the owner isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obeying, the cat may swat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you feed them to stop the behavior. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a learned component. It works.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of cats are bored and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the bigger picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the only thing they have to do all day is eat, they will ask for more and more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rather than overfeed cats to please them, she said, owners could engage their natural curiosity with interactive play, even training them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 really \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to go to their place and wait for food.Putting Maya on a diet was hard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe begging! The meowing! I felt like I was torturing her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.With just a few more pounds to reach her goal, Maya is a different cat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe light is turned on inside her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Peluso. Maya chases toys and plays hide-and-seek with their other cat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe can jump on our bed and sleep with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe unknowingly got her into that situation, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to bring her back.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome behavior modification obstacles remain, particularly when the couple goes on vacation.

Mr. Cruz announced that he would not pull the ad, daring Mr. Trump, who has threatened for days to file some form of suit against his rival, to do just that. That spat was capped by the surprise announcement that Gov. Nikki R. Haley, Republican of South Carolina, was endorsing Mr. Rubio, providing him with a potentially significant push in the final three days. That announcement was a blow to Jeb Bush, who seemed to be wearing disappointment at events during the day. Those four candidates all hope to finish in the top three slots in South Carolina.After Saturday, the race moves to territory that is more favorable to Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, with a string of contests in the Midwest. Mr. Rubio hopes to consolidate much of the vote to try to become the person who can sell himself to voters and donors as the man to stop Mr. Trump, who has run through the reeds of the Republican establishment with a machete in recent days.

{"Headline": "Outrage Grows as Italy Investigates Student\u2019s Death in Egypt", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byThe newspaper, Il Manifesto, published an article on Friday that the Italian student, Giulio Regeni, 28, had written under a pseudonym weeks before he was found dead that was sharply critical of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while describing faltering attempts by Egyptian unions to organize.There was no indication that Mr. Regeni\u2019s writing led to his death, but the article contributed to the broader Italian outrage over Mr. Regeni\u2019s injuries as news outlets pointed an accusatory finger at the Egyptian security forces. Egyptian officials said on Thursday that Mr. Regeni had been tortured extensively and probably died from a brain hemorrhage.\u201cGiulio, Egyptian police under accusation,\u201d read the headline of La Stampa, a Turin-based daily newspaper.Hoping to defuse a potentially damaging crisis with a relatively close European ally, Egyptian officials promised cooperation and vowed to find Mr. Regeni\u2019s killers. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, spoke with Mr. Sisi by telephone and both agreed to cooperate to \u201cunravel the mystery,\u201d Mr. Sisi\u2019s office said in a statement.Italian officials had strenuously urged Egypt to allow a joint investigation into the killing, and on Friday evening, a team of Italian and Interpol investigators was scheduled to land in Cairo, officials from both countries said.That was proof, said Egypt\u2019s ambassador to Rome, Amr Helmy, of the two countries\u2019 \u201cmutual desire to identify the culprits who committed this criminal, shameful act.\u201dBut before the Italians had landed, Egyptian investigators claimed to have made a breakthrough that, to critics, raised the specter of a cover-up. Having determined that Mr. Regeni\u2019s killing was a \u201ccriminal and not a terrorist act,\u201d an interior ministry official said, the authorities had arrested and were investigating two suspects in Giza.Mr. Regeni, a doctoral candidate at Cambridge University, arrived in Egypt in September to conduct field research into Egypt\u2019s labor movement, particularly among street vendors. That is a sensitive subject in a country where disgruntled workers helped oust President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Mr. Regeni\u2019s academic supervisors said he took care not to get into trouble with his research, although he wrote on the side for Il Manifesto. He used a pseudonym because he worried about the \u201cgeneral atmosphere of repression\u201d since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, said Giuseppe Acconcia, a journalist at the paper, in an email.Mr. Acconcia said that in recent weeks Mr. Regeni had expressed concern about the harsh government-led crackdown before the anniversary on Jan. 25 of the uprising that ultimately ousted Mr. Mubarak, but did not report specific threats to himself.It turned out that Jan. 25 was the day Mr. Regeni disappeared, shortly after he left his apartment to meet a fellow Italian near Tahrir Square in Cairo. Who took him, and why, are the central questions facing investigators.But in Mr. Regeni\u2019s case, the strongest suspicions have focused on the security forces because the circumstances of his disappearance match those of many Egyptians who have vanished into secretive detention facilities, run by the security forces, where torture is common. Most appear in court or jail, but some have been found dead.Mr. Regeni\u2019s body was discovered hours after Mr. Sisi met with an Italian trade delegation in Cairo Wednesday. In the meeting, Italian officials expressed concern for Mr. Regeni, who was then still missing. That evening, the Italian ambassador to Cairo cut short a diplomatic reception when he learned that Mr. Regeni\u2019s body had been found. On social media, other Egyptians say the case is a suggestion that even foreigners \u2014 who are regularly painted as spies by the news media, but rarely subjected to violence by the security forces \u2014 are not immune from the harsh treatment many Egyptians have endured for decades.\u201cNot while the media is constantly charging people and pushing them to doubt any foreigner in the street as a potential spy seeking to destroy their country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNot while this state of fear and doubt is pushing everyone to take matters into his/her own hands.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome, and Merna Thomas and Nour Youssef from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything About Everything: David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u2018Infinite Jest\u2019 at 20", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byEssaySomething happens to a novel as it ages, but what? It doesn\u2019t ripen or deepen in the manner of cheese and wine, and it doesn\u2019t fall apart, at least not figuratively. Fiction has no half-life. We age alongside the novels we\u2019ve read, and only one of us is actively deteriorating. Which is to say that a novel is perishable only by virtue of being stored in such a leaky cask: our heads. With just a few years\u2019 passage, a novel can thus seem \u201cdated\u201d or \u201cirrelevant\u201d or (God help us) \u201cproblematic.\u201d When a novel survives this strange process, and gets reissued in a handsome 20th-anniversary edition, it\u2019s tempting to hold it up and say, \u201cIt withstood the test of time.\u201d Most would intend such a statement as praise, but is a 20-year-old novel successful merely because it seems cleverly predictive or contains scenarios that feel \u201crelevant\u201d to later audiences? If that were the mark of enduring fiction, Philip K. Dick would be the greatest novelist of all time.How is it, then, that \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d still feels so transcendentally, electrically alive? Theory 1: As a novel about an \u201centertainment\u201d weaponized to enslave and destroy all who look upon it, \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is the first great Internet novel. Yes, William Gibson and Neal Stephenson may have gotten there first with \u201cNeuromancer\u201d and \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d whose Matrix and Metaverse, respectively, more accurately surmised what the Internet would look and feel like. (Wallace, among other things, failed to anticipate the break from cartridge- and disc-based entertainment.) But \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d warned against the insidious virality of popular entertainment long before anyone but the most Delphic philosophers of technology. Sharing videos, binge-watching Netflix, the resultant neuro-pudding at the end of an epic gaming marathon, the perverse seduction of recording and devouring our most ordinary human thoughts on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 Wallace somehow knew all this was coming, and (as the man himself might have put it) it gave him the howling fantods.Theory 3: \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is a peerlessly gripping novel of character. Even very fine novelists struggle with character, because creating characters that are not just prismatic snap-off versions of oneself happens to be supremely difficult. In \u201cHow Fiction Works,\u201d the literary critic James Wood, whose respectful but ultimately cool view of Wallace\u2019s work is as baffling as Conrad\u2019s rejection of Melville and Nabokov\u2019s dismissal of Bellow, addresses E.\u2009M. Forster\u2019s famous distinction between \u201cflat\u201d and \u201cround\u201d characters: \u201cIf I try to distinguish between major and minor characters \u2014 round and flat characters \u2014 and claim that these differ in terms of subtlety, depth, time allowed on the page, I must concede that many so-called flat characters seem more alive to me, and more interesting as human studies, however short-lived, than the round characters they are supposedly subservient to.\u201d Anyone reading or rereading \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d will notice an interesting pertinence: Throughout the book, Wallace\u2019s flat, minor, one-note characters walk as tall as anyone, peacocks of diverse idiosyncrasy. Wallace doesn\u2019t simply set a scene and novelize his characters into facile life; rather, he makes an almost metaphysical commitment to see reality through their eyes. A fine example of this occurs early in \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d during its \u201cWhere was the woman who said she\u2019d come\u201d interlude, which concerns the paranoid weed addict Ken Erdedy, whose terror of being considered a too eager drug buyer has engendered an unwelcome situation: He is unsure whether or not he actually managed to make an appointment with a woman able to access 200 grams of \u201cunusually good\u201d marijuana, which he very much wants to spend the weekend smoking. For 11 pages, Erdedy does nothing but sweat and anticipate this woman\u2019s increasingly conjectural arrival with his desired 200 grams. I suspect no one who has struggled with substance addiction can read this passage without squirming, gasping or weeping. I know of nothing else in the entirety of literature that so convincingly inhabits a drug-smashed consciousness while remaining a model of empathetic clarity. The literary craftsman\u2019s term for what Wallace is doing within the Erdedy interlude is free indirect style, but while reading Wallace you get the feeling that bloodless matters of craftsmanship rather bored him. Instead, he had to somehow psychically become his characters, which is surely why he wrote so often, and so well, in a microscopically close third person. In this very specific sense, Wallace may be the closest thing to a method actor in American literature, which I cannot imagine was without its subtle traumas. And Erdedy is merely one of the novel\u2019s hundreds of differently damaged walk-on characters! Sometimes I wonder: What did it cost Wallace to create him?Theory 4: \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is unquestionably the novel of its generation. As a member (barely) of the generation Wallace was part of, and as a writer whose closest friends are writers (most of whom are Wallace fans), and as someone who first read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d at perhaps the perfect age (22, as a Peace Corps volunteer in Uzbekistan), my testimony on this point may well be riddled with partisanship. So allow me to drop the mask of the introducer to show the homely face of a fan, and much later a friend, of David Wallace.As I read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d in the dark early mornings before my Uzbek language class, I could hear my host mother talking to the chickens in the barn on the other side of my bedroom wall as she flung scatters of feed before them. I could hear the cows stirring, and then their deep monstrous mooing, along with the compound\u2019s approximately 10,000 wild cats moving in the crawl space directly above my bed. What I am trying to say is that it should have been difficult to focus on the doings of Hal Incandenza, Don Gately, R\u00e9my Marathe and Madame Psychosis. But it wasn\u2019t. I read for hours that way, morning after morning, my mind awhirl. For the first few hundred pages of my initial reading, I will confess that I greatly disliked \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d Why? Jealousy, frustration, impatience. It\u2019s hard to remember exactly why. It wasn\u2019t until I was writing letters to my girlfriend, and describing to her my fellow Peace Corps volunteers and host-family members and long walks home through old Soviet collectivized farmland in what I would categorize as yellow-belt Wallaceian prose, that I realized how completely the book had rewired me. Here is one of the great Wallace innovations: the revelatory power of freakishly thorough noticing, of corralling and controlling detail. Most great prose writers make the real world seem realer \u2014 it\u2019s why we read great prose writers. But Wallace does something weirder, something more astounding: Even when you\u2019re not reading him, he trains you to study the real world through the lens of his prose. Several writers\u2019 names have become adjectivized \u2014 Kafkaesque, Orwellian, Dickensian \u2014 but these are designators of mood, of situation, of civic decay. The Wallaceian is not a description of something external; it describes something that happens ecstatically within, a state of apprehension (in both senses) and understanding. He didn\u2019t name a condition, in other words. He created one.As I learned \u2014 as Wallace\u2019s eager imitators learned \u2014 as Wallace himself learned \u2014 there were limits to the initially limitless-seeming style Wallace helped pioneer in \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d All great stylists eventually become prisoners of their style and, in a final indignity, find themselves locked up with their acolytes. Wallace avoided this fate. For one, he never finished another novel. For two, he created ever more space between the halves of his career \u2014 the friendly, coruscating essayist and the difficult, hermetically inclined fiction writer \u2014 so that, eventually, there was little to connect them. Another way of saying this is that the essays got even better and funnier \u2014 the funniest since Twain \u2014 while the fiction got even darker and more theoretically severe, even if so much of it was excellent.The last time I saw David Wallace, in the spring of 2008, he successfully affected artistic contentment, which I now know was the antipode of his true feelings. Nevertheless, I came away from our encounter excited about the work that was to come, which he\u2019d briefly alluded to. He\u2019d given us one novel of generational significance; surely he\u2019d write the novel that helped us define what the next century would feel like. Our great loss is that he didn\u2019t. His great gift is that the world remains as Wallaceian as ever \u2014 Donald Trump, meet President Johnny Gentle \u2014 and now we\u2019re all reading his unwritten books in our heads.David, where be your gibes now? Your gambols, your songs \u2014 your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? They\u2019re in the books, where they\u2019ve always been. Will always be. You have borne us on your back a thousand times. For you, and the joyful, despairing \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d we will roar forever amazed, forever sorrowful, forever grateful. I hope against hope you can hear us.Tom Bissell\u2019s new book is \u201cApostle: Travels Among the Tombs of the Twelve.\u201d This essay is adapted from his foreword to the 20th-anniversary edition of \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d by David Foster Wallace, which will be published later this year.Advertisement"}

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York,  is an admirer of Donald J. Trump and has been friends with him for decades. His endorsement could be useful to Mr. Trump, both as an affirmation in national security terms and an appeal to transplanted New Yorkers in Florida and elsewhere. But while Mr. Giuliani speaks with Mr. Trump regularly, and has done so for months, he does not consider himself an adviser and is not yet ready to endorse any of the candidates. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it advising him,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a telephone interview on Monday after a published report suggested he has recently emerged as a key adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m going to endorse,\u201d though he said he was open to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, but \u201cnot Cruz,\u201d he said, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief rival so far.Mr. Giuliani was mayor for eight years and before that the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump has been a major figure since the late 1980s. \u201cI talk to him on a pretty regular basis,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself an adviser. I\u2019ve talked to Donald for 25 years. So I talk to him a lot anyway.\u201d Mr. Giuliani said he frequently spoke with Jeb Bush when he was a candidate, about as frequently as he did to Mr. Trump, and that he spoke more frequently with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, with whom he is also friends. As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani said he would call and offer his thoughts and advice on a range of topics. \u201cSometimes he takes it, sometimes he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. He told Mr. Trump that he thought his statement during his campaign kickoff speech that Mexican immigrants were rapists and were bringing crime into the country \u201cwas backwards,\u201d although he thought he had \u201ca pretty good point about illegal immigration.\u201d He said he also still considered former President George W. Bush \u201cone of my heroes,\u201d and disagreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions that the Bush administration has mishandled the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But Mr. Giuliani, who was heralded for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and ran for president himself in 2008, said Mr. Trump had made a valuable case about China\u2019s currency manipulation. He  said he also valued what Mr. Trump had said about the terrorism threats of the Islamic State.Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio are \u201cmore flexible people\u201d than Mr.  Cruz, Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThey\u2019re not rigid ideologues.\u201d He added of Mr. Trump, \u201cYou don\u2019t succeed in business by being a rigid ideologue.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Wavers on Disavowing David Duke", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Donald J. Trump came under fire on Sunday for declining to disavow the support of David Duke, the white nationalist and ex-Ku Klux Klansman who has called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cby far the best candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFacing criticism from his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Trump later moved to distance himself from Mr. Duke. However, the sequence exposed Mr. Trump to questions about his judgment and fitness to be president.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, just so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in an interview with CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Duke has not formally endorsed Mr. Trump, but he has embraced the Republican presidential candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause wholeheartedly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cVoting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Duke told his radio audience recently.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he deserves a close look by those who believe the era of political correctness needs to come to an end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Duke said, calling for a leader who would secure the border and dismantle the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJewish controlled\u00e2\u0080\u009d financial industry.The discussion of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support among white supremacists comes on a day when he also re-posted a tweet quoting Benito Mussolini, the founder of the fascist movement, and called for libel laws to be weakened so that he could more easily sue the press when it covers him critically.The campaigns of Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz pounced on Mr. Trump for failing to distance himself from Mr. Duke on Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you need to do research on the K.K.K. before you can repudiate them, you are not ready or fit to be president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe Pounder, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u2019re better than this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, addressing Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should all agree, racism is wrong, K.K.K. is abhorrent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome civil rights groups also expressed concern about a mainstream politician failing to denounce white supremacist ideology.\u00e2\u0080\u009cCondemning David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan at every opportunity should be the easiest thing anyone can do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hatefulness of their ideas and actions are well established and should be condemned forcefully by all responsible political leaders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of knowledge of Mr. Duke was surprising because he said as recently as Friday that he did disavow Mr. Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support.Mr. Trump also expressed his disapproval of Mr. Duke back in 2000 after deciding not to embark on a presidential bid in the Reform Party.\u201cThe Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. Fulani,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement, referring to Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani, the former standard-bearer of the New Alliance Party and an advocate of Marxist-Leninist politics. \u201cThis is not company I wish to keep.\u201dBut on Sunday, Mr. Trump insisted that he would not condemn someone who he does not know anything about.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t know David Duke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t believe I have ever met him.

{"Headline": "The R\u00e9sum\u00e9 and References Check Out. How About Social Media?", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byThe WorkologistThe human resources department at my company (a nonprofit with about 100 employees) is extremely concerned with avoiding hiring factors that might get us into trouble legally. So obviously they don\u2019t ask candidates about age, marital status and so forth. But they also do not look at a potential employee\u2019s social media. There is little case law to date, Ms. Bertini said, so employers are wise to be cautious \u2014 but, she added, they needn\u2019t overreact. The main risk, she said, is in drawing conclusions based on social media that result in decisions that would be legally problematic under any circumstances: rejecting a candidate as a result of learning of her pregnancy, for instance.Yet flat-out blindness to a potential employee\u2019s public social media presence seems, at this point, like overkill. If a candidate who describes himself as a people person in a job interview is simultaneously posting overtly bigoted comments on a Twitter or Facebook account that\u2019s visible to everyone on the Internet, that\u2019s a defensible reason (legally and morally) for not making him your new sales representative.\u201cIt\u2019s going to surface, and you\u2019re going to have to deal with it one way or another,\u201d Ms. Bertini said. \u201cSo why not deal with it when you still haven\u2019t hired the person?\u201dMs. Bertini checks sources like LinkedIn and public Facebook profiles when screening candidates for jobs at her firm, and recalls one who seemed promising but had a questionable profile picture. When asked, the candidate agreed that it projected the wrong image, and changed it. She got the job and has proved \u201cphenomenal,\u201d Ms. Bertini said.In the above situation \u2014 being \u201calerted\u201d to a job candidate\u2019s potentially offensive social media comments \u2014 you should proceed with care. If those comments are truly public and raise legitimate concerns about a potential negative impact on your company, it seems fair to bring them to H.R.\u2019s attention. Then let those in charge of hiring decide how to proceed.But if you know about these questionable comments only because you happen to be in touch with somebody who has access to the person\u2019s more private online expressions, you might think twice. A basic litmus test might be: How comfortable would you be explaining exactly how you know about the comments?In other words, social media has to be treated with the same nuance as real life \u2014 because these days, that\u2019s what it is.Enjoying the rewards (financial or emotional) of certain professions or positions can entail sacrificing the clearer limits of the proverbial 9-to-5 gig. And of course technology has made the work-life boundary more porous in general \u2014 so maybe answering the occasional job-related weekend email balances out time spent browsing travel bargains at the office.But just because managers can communicate with employees at all hours doesn\u2019t make such behavior necessary, or even smart. Bothering a worker who is on vacation when there are other solutions isn\u2019t necessarily evidence of a boss setting a standard. It may just be evidence of an impulsive and disorganized management style.So I concede that workers should not merely blow off emails from the boss across the board. But simply acquiescing to nonstop, instant availability isn\u2019t the solution. The key is to find a balance that works best for the organization. The best managers in even the most demanding professions understand that, in the long run, everyone benefits from legitimate downtime.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bumpy Rise of a Young Bull Rider", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "21st-Century ManCooper Davis is a husband and father at age 21. And he has one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.Supported byFor two long evenings and one long day in late January, Kaitlyn Davis sat high in the stands of Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, tucked in with her 8-month-old son, Mackston, his stuffed toy bull and a large Louis Vuitton leather carryall packed with baby supplies. \u201cStory of my life,\u201d Ms. Davis said, noting the Vuitton bag and the toy bull.Ms. Davis, 20, and her husband, Cooper Davis, 21, had driven all night from Buna, Tex., so that Mr. Davis, a professional bull rider, could compete in the three-day event, his first since winning the Professional Bull Riders world finals \u2014 along with its $250,000 purse \u2014 last October.Ms. Davis was more anxious than usual about the weekend\u2019s rides. Her husband had recently sliced three tendons while working on his parents\u2019 barn when a metal sheet slipped off the roof and sheared his right wrist. His hand surgeon had cleared him for \u201cnormal activities,\u201d Ms. Davis said, \u201cbut bull riding is not a normal activity.\u201dIt is not. Bull riders endeavor to spend eight seconds \u2014 an eternity, if you\u2019re watching or living it \u2014 on the back of a one-ton animal whose bucking and spinning creates a hurricane of centrifugal force. Young men like Mr. Davis, 5 feet 9 inches tall and 140 pounds, hang on with a combination of arm strength, balance and steely focus.It\u2019s a violent, bloody and, yes, beautiful sport. Concussions, spine trauma and torn shoulders, groins and knees are its most common injuries. Mr. Davis has broken both ankles, a shoulder and his jaw. Not that you can tell by looking at him. Mr. Davis, exceedingly fair and fine-boned, appears unmarked, closer to 17 than 21.But bull riding, he went on to say, \u201cis different from the gaudiness of rodeo. It\u2019s different from the corporate grandiosity of professional football. There\u2019s no other contest between man and beast like this. People say hunting is a confrontation between man and beast. But the hunter has a gun. All the bull rider has is a rope to hang on to.\u201d12 PhotosThis is why Ms. Davis was sweating out each night, bleary-eyed from the long drive and a tenacious cold. \u201cI\u2019m worried about his hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish he\u2019d waited to ride another week.\u201dMr. Davis was typically sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about it.\u201dRetirement comes at an early age, and very few people walk away from the sport unscathed, as Cody Lambert, one of founders of the PBR, said. \u201cAt the end, there\u2019s not a bunch of jobs just waiting for them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur dream when we started was to make it where young men could retire from the sport and have something, so they could start their own business or have their own ranch. We had watched a lot of our heroes go through their careers and have nothing at the end, and no job skills either.\u201dStock contracting \u2014 breeding and leasing the bulls to events \u2014 can be an option. Last April, L. J. Jenkins, 28, broke his neck riding a bull named Strong Heart, ending an 11-year career. This year, he and his wife, Christen Dye, have their own stock company and are leasing bulls to the PBR. In Oklahoma City, four of their animals \u2014 Mister Mean, Hurt Me No More, Rooster and Ricky \u2014 were competing.A reporter asked Ms. Dye if she was relieved when Mr. Jenkins was forced to retire. \u201cHe\u2019d never had a really bad accident before,\u201d she said, \u201cso I never thought he was going to. I never worried.\u201dTandy R. Freeman III, the PBR\u2019s medical director, said all bull riders are stoic about their injuries: \u201cThere is an ethos some call \u2018cowboy up.\u2019 You\u2019re not supposed to complain about things, you\u2019re supposed to just do your job.\u201dBehind her, four preteen girls in nearly identical uniforms \u2014 plaid shirts, bluejeans and neatly brushed curtains of long hair \u2014 shouted out the words to Luke Bryan\u2019s \u201cCountry Girl (Shake It for Me).\u201d Ms. Davis tends to sits apart from the other wives and girlfriends, mostly because last year, the year Mr. Davis went pro, she was at first pregnant with Mack, and then holding Mack the newborn, a consuming situation that precluded bonding with the other women. \u201cAlso,\u201d she said, \u201cCooper and I were both newbies.\u201dMs. Davis was studying marketing and communications at Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex., and working for a home builder when she met Mr. Davis. He courted her with the same single-minded focus he brings to bull riding. When he told her what he did for a living, she laughed. \u201cNo, what\u2019s your real job?\u201d she said.Soon after they started dating two years ago, Mr. Davis bought a 5,000-square-foot brick house with white columns and white shutters on 10 acres in Buna, a traffic stop of a town 45 minutes from Beaumont. He begged Ms. Davis to move in with him, and when she hesitated, he moved all her clothes instead.\u201cMy father said, \u2018If you take her, you can\u2019t bring her back,\u2019\u201d Ms. Davis recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve been there ever since.\u201dThe house is airy and decorated in cowboy chic: plump, tufted English sofas in cowhide and leather; kitchen chairs with a Southwestern print upholstered by Mr. Davis. He and Ms. Davis are handy and house-proud.They each have a walk-in closet; his is as full as hers. Bull riding is messy, but riders have to be clothes hounds, wearing the logos and apparel of their sponsors, on crisply starched shirts and pressed bluejeans from Ariat, say, one of Mr. Davis\u2019s seven sponsors, or Wrangler. According to the PBR, top riders earn $75,000 to $100,000 a year from each of their sponsors. Cowboy fashion is punishing; Mr. Davis wears Band-Aids on his nipples so they don\u2019t bleed from the abundance of starch in his shirts.When he proposed, Mr. Davis led Ms. Davis on an elaborate scavenger hunt that ended at the house, where Mr. Davis was standing in a heart-shaped ring of votive candles. On the back door, he had hung a framed chalkboard that read, in part, \u201cI don\u2019t expect things to be easy, but I\u2019ll always be here when they\u2019re tough.\u201dMr. Davis has been riding bulls since he was 13, to the profound dismay of his family. \u201cThey all hated it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was one of those things I wanted to do so bad, and they weren\u2019t going to tell me no, and once they figured out I was pretty good, they felt better about the choice.\u201d Well, not exactly.\u201cWe thought he would grow out of it,\u201d said Kim Davis, his mother. \u201cWhen he broke his shoulder in high school, we thought that would make him not want to ride. We begged him to stop, but there was no stopping him.\u201dSenior year, Mr. Davis was competing so often \u2014 and winning handily \u2014 that he home-schooled himself on the road. Later, he enrolled at a community college and joined its rodeo league, which meant his tuition was paid for, but he left before the semester was up because he realized he would rather go pro while he was young and strong. In October, when Mr. Davis won the World Finals, he paid off the mortgage on the house.\u201cHis dad and I are still paying on our house,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of Cooper.\u201d Not that it gets any easier watching him compete. \u201cAs a mother, you never get used to it, ever.\u201dOn Friday night in Oklahoma, Mr. Davis rode conservatively, and earned a decent score. Bulls and riders both accrue points: bulls for their feistiness, riders for their grace and body control. On Saturday, the chute opened before Mr. Davis was ready, and he didn\u2019t last the full eight seconds.Afterward, he didn\u2019t contest the outcome and ask for a reride. Mr. Davis is a gracious guy: Friday night after he rode, he signed autographs for a good half-hour, even though his hand was aching. Not all the riders fronted up for this post-event tradition. Sunday was a good day: Mr. Davis scored in the top 10.Late that night, Mr. Davis and Ms. Davis drove the eight hours back to Buna, dropped Mack off with his grandparents, and then immediately drove to Houston to fly to Colorado for two days of skiing before the next event that weekend in Anaheim, Calif. Speaking by phone from Breckenridge, Colo., Mr. Davis was cheerful despite not having slept. \u201cOklahoma helped me get the monkey off my back,\u201d he said, meaning his hand. \u201cNow, I\u2019m back to riding bulls and having fun. Same old, same old.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the annual attendance at the Professional Bull Riders tour. It is 3 million, not 1.5 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Hunt for the Attacker in the Fatal Stabbings of 3 on Staten Island", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byThe man, identified by the police as Michael Sykes, 23, of Brooklyn, made his way from the scene at the Ramada in the Willowbrook section of Staten Island, to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal on Wednesday after the stabbings, officials said.Less than an hour after the killings, a man matching Mr. Sykes\u2019s description was seen aboard a Manhattan-bound ferry that had left the terminal at 9:30 a.m., a law enforcement official said. A passenger on the ferry contacted detectives on Wednesday night to say that the man had been fidgeting with a cellphone before breaking it apart and tossing it overboard, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. The man in question was later seen elsewhere in the city, the official said.As Mr. Sykes was fleeing, the authorities said, a housekeeper at the hotel discovered the bodies of Rebecca Cutler, 26, and her three daughters. Two of the girls, Ziana, 1, and a 4-month-old whom the police identified as Maiyah, but who was identified on her mother\u2019s Facebook page as Maliyah, later died. Ms. Cutler had been stabbed more than two dozen times, and the girls had been stabbed multiple times as well, the official said.Ms. Cutler\u2019s eldest daughter, 2-year-old Miracle, survived the attack. She was in critical but stable condition at Richmond University Medical Center on Staten Island on Thursday and was expected to recover.An absence of crucial clues was hampering the search for Mr. Sykes, the official said. His lack of a criminal record, for instance, meant investigators had no fingerprints to work with. And the fact that he did not have a phone of his own meant there were no digital trail to follow, the official said.The police had not determined what prompted the killings, but investigators were exploring the possibility that Mr. Sykes had exploded in a jealous rage over Ms. Cutler\u2019s relationship with the father of Ziana and Miracle, the law enforcement official said.The police have said Mr. Sykes took Ms. Cutler\u2019s phone during a dispute on Tuesday evening. According to the official, investigators believe it was the same phone the man was seen destroying on the ferry. Mr. Sykes may have taken the phone to determine whether Ms. Cutler had been calling another man, the official said.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the focus of his rage might have been the fact that he thought that she was in some way getting back with, or maintaining some ongoing relationship with the father,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we think that he snatched her cellphone the day before.\u201dStill, all seemed well with the pair when they were seen having breakfast together Wednesday morning, and there had been no obvious clues that she was in danger, the police have said.The killings thrust the city\u2019s homelessness problem back into the spotlight, prompting officials to review protocols and increase security at the remaining 40 hotels used to house families that cannot be accommodated in shelters.The 28 remaining homeless families at the motel were moved to other accommodations, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The other hotels used to house homeless people were offered 24-hour security; the three others on Staten Island all accepted, the spokeswoman, Ishanee Parikh said.Relatives of Ms. Cutler\u2019s who had been at the hospital since first learning of the killings had not yet begun to think about making funeral arrangements, an uncle, James Mathis, said on Thursday.Mr. Mathis said his niece had wound up homeless after leaving his apartment in search of privacy and independence.Mr. Mathis said that his wife did not like Mr. Sykes and banned him from the family\u2019s apartment.Mr. Sykes lived with his family on the third floor in Howard Houses, a public housing project in East New York, and the police were searching for him there.On Thursday, residents of the building where Mr. Sykes lived recalled a pleasant young man who offered to help tenants carry their groceries and held the door as residents.Jamie Underwood, who lives down the hall from Mr. Sykes\u2019s family, said every encounter was marked with pleasantries.\u201cI watched him grow up,\u201d Mr. Underwood said. \u201cHe held the door for me just last week.\u201dKenneth R. Rosen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It even shows Mr. Trump saying that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was only a hero because he was captured.Interspersed with that footage is Mr. McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, saying that he would support the candidate his party nominates in any case. The ad concludes with an image of Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign slogan, \u201cCountry First,\u201d and laments that 30 years and Washington have changed the Arizona senator.\u201cNo matter what Donald Trump says, John McCain would support him for president,\u201d the narrator says.Lorna Romero, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, called the ad a \u201ccheap, pathetic display.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "F.E.C. Tells Sanders Campaign That Some Donors May Have Given Too Much", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "The Federal Election Commission has asked the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to re-examine contributions from more than a hundred donors who appear to have given more than the legally permissible amount.The vast majority of the donors gave several small contributions to Mr. Sanders for the Democratic primary that eventually totaled more than the $2,700 limit, according to a letter the election commission sent to Mr. Sanders on Thursday. Such glitches are common in political campaigns, which are required to track small donors and begin itemizing their contributions when their total reaches $200. That can be harder when donors use slightly different variations of their names or contribute from more than one address. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign may choose to refund the excess contributions or re-designate the excess for use in a general election campaign, when candidates can accept another $2,700.But the F.E.C.\u2019s review suggests that the sheer volume of small contributions Mr. Sanders is receiving \u2014 more than 3 million of them so far, according to his campaign \u2014 may be straining his campaign\u2019s ability to keep track of which donors are which. Most of the contributions cited by the commission were given by donors with relatively unusual names, whose small checks are generally easier to tally.In early February, after the end of the fourth fund-raising quarter, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign announced that it had more than 1.3 million donors, an astonishing number for so early in the campaign cycle. And last week, the campaign announced it had received 3.25 million total donations, the most of any presidential candidate in the race. The campaign\u2019s most recent F.E.C. filing was nearly 100,000 pages long.In an e-mail, Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are looking into the F.E.C. staff questions and are committed to full and accurate disclosure of the tremendous grass-roots support for Sen.

{"Headline": "Deal Shows Investors Are Willing to Make a Blind Bet on Uber", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byA deal about to close on Wall Street illustrates just how much some investors are willing to give up to gain a piece of the hottest start-up.The institutional investors are getting financial disclosures on revenue and expense metrics and projections, a person briefed on those terms said. But the 290-page offering document for the New Riders fund, which was reviewed by The New York Times, does not provide any financial details about Uber.The investors are also not getting direct equity in Uber, but only indirectly through the fund. As a result, the fund has few protections for investors.Even so, all this has not stopped wealthy investors from committing about $500 million to Uber\u2019s latest round, the people briefed on the transaction said, valuing the San Francisco-based company at $62.5 billion.The fund\u2019s investors are seeking to profit from whenever Uber decides to go public, presumably at a much higher valuation.Such speculation highlights the euphoria that still surrounds a select group of Silicon Valley start-ups even as valuations for others decline and the public stock market stumbles. For some investors, the deal is as much about having an early, exclusive slice of a trailblazing company, one that has become the world\u2019s most valuable start-up.\u201cOnly Uber can do this,\u201d said Joshua M. Brown, a financial adviser at Ritholtz Wealth Management. \u201cThey are the last of the gigantic unicorns that people are clamoring to get into.\u201dMorgan Stanley is offering $475 million of new preferred stock in Uber to its clients, the people said, through a special fund that holds only those shares. These clients must have a net worth of at least $10 million and a minimum investment of $250,000. They are not allowed to invest more than 5 percent of their net worth.Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also pitching Uber to its clients through a similar fund. The brokerage firm, however, requires an investment of at least $1 million and a net worth of $100 million, and its clients must have had $5 million in Merrill Lynch accounts for six months, people briefed on the Bank of America terms said. This may explain why Bank of America is expected to sell just $25 million worth of the deal, they said.Representatives from Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Uber declined to comment for this article.But in some ways the Uber deal is asking even more of investors. The company has already raised $10 billion as a private company and has yet to give any indication of when it might go public. And despite raising large sums of cash, Uber has spent much of that expanding around the world \u2014 and is still losing money.The wealthy investors buying into the deal most likely know of at least some of the risks and can afford to lose money.Still, the lack of financial data on Uber in the deal documents could become a disadvantage for them. Without details on revenue, costs and other data, it is hard for the investors to assess over time whether the company is performing well and whether the more than $60 billion valuation was expensive or cheap.In the offering document, Morgan Stanley says that Uber represents an \u201cattractive investment opportunity\u201d but warns that it \u201chas conducted limited due diligence with respect to the company.\u201d The document says Morgan Stanley has not \u201cindependently verified the accuracy or completeness of such information.\u201d\u201cLack of visibility, that\u2019s par for the course with these types of things,\u201d said Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm. \u201cThere\u2019s been unlimited appetite for Uber equity; they\u2019ve been able to raise at will.\u201dFor Morgan Stanley, the deal may raise competing loyalties. On the one hand, the firm gets up to 2 percent of the capital that wealthy investors commit, as well as a small performance fee if their investment triples.Yet the deal may be more important to Morgan Stanley for cementing its relationship with Uber. It could put the Wall Street firm in a prime position for investment-banking business, like leading an initial public offering or advising on acquisitions.Morgan Stanley has sought to address this tension by including 10 pages of potential conflicts of interest in the deal document.An argument can be made that in funds like New Riders, banks are helping democratize to a degree the process for investing in private companies. Start-ups are staying private longer than ever before, enabling institutional investors like venture-capital funds and hedge funds to benefit from the biggest growth spurts.At that time, rules prohibited having more than 500 investors \u201cof record\u201d without publishing financial disclosures. To avoid them, Goldman Sachs set up a fund, designating itself the investor \u201cof record,\u201d while allowing its own wealthy clients to acquire interest in the fund.The structure was similar to Morgan Stanley\u2019s current arrangement with Uber: placement fees paid to the bank, little liquidity, and few financials, said a person briefed on the terms from 2011. In the end, Goldman Sachs had to restrict the investment to those outside the United States, on concern that the firm may have violated regulatory prohibitions for \u201cgeneral solicitation and advertising\u201d private offerings.The Facebook case turned out fine. The company made its market debut with a valuation of more than $100 billion \u2014 more than twice where Goldman Sachs clients invested, and even though it slipped to about $60 billion one year after going public, most still came out ahead. Today, Facebook is valued at $315 billion.Many of the restrictions that hampered the Goldman Sachs-Facebook deal were lifted through the Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups Act of 2012. The investors in the Uber fund are no doubt hoping to repeat the success that those investors had in Facebook. But there are risks.\u201cThey are a brand-name, venture start-up,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey are basically saying, \u2018We\u2019re Uber and no one\u2019s putting a gun to your head, and we\u2019re doing you a favor.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

Donald J. Trump has held a comfortable lead, with several candidates bunched up in competition for second place. Those candidates include Mr. Christie and Mr. Rubio, but also the winner of the Iowa caucuses, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.

{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Meets Yahoo Developers at a Confrontation-Free Gathering", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Many of the people attending Yahoo\u2019s mobile developer conference on Thursday were not there for the traditional business of striking deals or learning more about the company\u2019s products.They were there to watch a live episode of Silicon Valley\u2019s 21-year-old soap opera: The Story of Yahoo. As one recently hired Yahoo employee put it, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to gossip?\u201dAnyone hoping for dramatic confrontations or big plot twists was sorely disappointed, however.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, clad in a jacket of white and Yahoo purple, made introductory remarks, noting that Yahoo had more than 600 million monthly users on mobile devices. She thanked the thousands of developers who had integrated Yahoo ads into their apps and were now raking in about $200 million a year in revenue from them (with Yahoo getting an extra $100 million or so on top of that).\u201cOur commitment to the developer community is stronger than ever,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cWe want you to know that you are in the right place.\u201dAs Ms. Mayer exited to modest applause, Simon Khalaf, the company\u2019s senior vice president for publisher products and the former chief of Flurry, the analytics company that Yahoo bought two years ago, took the stage.He delivered his annual report on the state of the mobile world, with his trademark array of fun facts and statistics. The number of people in the world who check their phones more than 60 times a day is now 280 million, he said \u2014 a population of mobile addicts big enough to be the fourth-largest country in the world.Americans spend an average of 4 hours 11 minutes a day on mobile phones, more time than they spend watching television. And mobile video game play was dropping because of the rise of e-sports, where spectators watch skilled players compete against one another.Next came a panel about the new trend of concierge services delivered through messaging services. Hyatt Hotels, for example, lets guests orders fresh towels via Facebook Messenger.But throughout, there was barely a mention of Yahoo or its role in the mobile world \u2014 perhaps because the company is still struggling to articulate a strategy that will help it compete with Facebook and Google, the two giants in mobile.In short, Yahoo was almost a bit character at its own show.Sitting in the audience of about 500 people, Bob Bahramipour, senior vice president for global business development at InMobi, an India-based global advertising platform, said he had mostly come to \u201cplant seeds\u201d about a possible future partnership with Yahoo.Given all the uncertainty over the company\u2019s future \u2014 will it be sold or broken up for parts? Will Ms. Mayer and her management team be forced out by disenchanted investors? \u2014 he said that InMobi was not sure that anyone at Yahoo would be in a position to close a deal anytime soon.Xinhua Liu, chief marketing officer of Cheetah Mobile, a Chinese company that makes mobile utilities and game apps with 567 million monthly users worldwide, was more upbeat. Yahoo, he said, was a great partner, supplying content, search results and native display ads \u2014 all things he couldn\u2019t get from other partners like Facebook and Google.\u201cYahoo is well positioned to serve these offers\u201d from brands, he said, complementing Cheetah\u2019s other revenue streams, such as application install ads from Facebook. Mr. Liu said that Yahoo\u2019s corporate turmoil did not worry him since the team he worked with was stable.The same could not be said of Mr. Khalaf\u2019s team, which includes Yahoo\u2019s news, finance, sports and media content. On Wednesday, Yahoo gutted its media staff and closed half of its digital magazines.In an interview after his presentation on Thursday, Mr. Khalaf said that the company would now focus more on showcasing content created by its users, concentrating on popular topics like news, sports, politics and finance.Conversations are important to driving traffic and engagement, Mr. Khalaf said. Investors, for example, don\u2019t just want to read articles about the companies in their stock portfolio, he said, \u201cthey want to brag about how their portfolio is doing.\u201dTumblr, the social network that Yahoo acquired in 2013, will be an important source of that user content, particularly for images and video. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you can do inexpensively,\u201d Mr. Khalaf said.As for the larger soap opera that is Yahoo, he said he reminds his team, \u201cIn the Valley, one day you\u2019re the pigeon and the second day you\u2019re the statue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The clowns first rambled into the soldiers\u2019 path on a recent weekend patrol, honking horns and singing nursery rhymes.The next Saturday, the Loldiers tried to repeat the trick at a nationalist rally. The police were not amused and arrested two of the clowns for disturbing the demonstration.Jussi Jalonen, a local historian who studies extreme right-wing movements, said the clown troupe was employing the art of parody in an attempt to make anti-immigration fervor and the vigilante patrols appear ridiculous.\u201cThey are basically a performance group who are protesting \u2014 peacefully and by the means of comedy \u2014 against the extreme right,\u201d he said.The clowns declined to break character to give interviews, though the clown who was arrested at the demonstration said afterward that he had made the police laugh when he was taken to the station. \u201cIt was lovely,\u201d the clown said of his arrest.Some of the anti-immigration demonstrators dismissed the clowns as anarchists. They said that just as in Batman\u2019s Gotham City, the heroes are the vigilantes, and the clowns are the villains.\u201cThey are trying to provoke the Soldiers of Odin to hit them, so they will take the blame,\u201d said one of the anti-immigration protesters, who was waving a flaming torch and identified himself only as Jarkko, a 36-year-old construction worker. \u201cBut the Soldiers of Odin have kept their cool and have not responded to their provocations.\u201dThe Soldiers of Odin were not visible at the demonstration, though some of the marchers said some members might have been there but not in their trademark leather jackets with images of Odin on the back.The Soldiers of Odin say they are undaunted by the arrival of the clowns, promising more marches when the snow melts in the spring and when new arrivals are expected.\u201cThey are not giving us trouble,\u201d said Tony, the leader of the Tampere division of the Soldiers of Odin. \u201cThey are making trouble for themselves.\u201dHis small vanguard of 50 soldiers emerged in Tampere over the past few weeks, playing off resentment of the elite, distrust of the Finnish news media, frustration over growing unemployment and fear prompted by a sudden influx of foreigners \u2014 all coming alongside accompanying reports of sexual assaults and terrorist attacks across the Continent in 2015.\u201cThey write that we are Nazis, but that is not true,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThe group is not a Nazi group. The group is a patrol group.\u201dHe said his group is well disciplined and imposes strict codes of conduct on members, though he declined to be specific.\u201cWe look very carefully who comes and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, referring to those allowed to participate in the patrols.Out on a midnight patrol, a new soldier who calls himself Sami, 42, a paramedic and a father of four, said the group had been wrongly portrayed by the news media.\u201cThey are making stories that put these guys in a bad light,\u201d said Sami, declining to give his last name out of concern that reporters would call him at work or home, as he trudged through the slush, watching for trouble.He has a black jacket, but he has not been in the group long enough to earn the Odin insignia on the back. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the police have enough resources,\u201d he said.The 1,200 new asylum seekers seem to be well aware that they are the subject of considerable controversy and fear. \u201cSome of them are afraid of us,\u201d said Ahmed Ramzi al-Bayati, 22, an asylum seeker from Iraq. \u201cWhen they see us, they step aside.\u201dBut he said he has nonetheless been made to feel welcome by volunteers and instances of local hospitality.\u201cI think they are afraid for their country,\u201d he said of the Finns. \u201cThey don\u2019t want anyone to demolish it after what they did to build it. No one wants that. But if they see the good side of us ...,\u201d he trailed off and smiled.Mayor Anna-Kaisa Ikonen said most people in Tampere view the influx of migrants with a moderate mix of generosity and pragmatism that belies the extremism on both sides of the issues. \u201cI hope we won\u2019t see this polarization going any further,\u201d she said.Vigilante patrols \u201cdefinitely are not the tradition,\u201d she said, stressing that she \u201chas always felt safe\u201d in her city, but that on the other hand, taking to the streets dressed in a clown suit was \u201cprobably not my way of doing things.\u201dTaina Kopra, the ringmaster of the local Sorin Circus and an experienced clown teacher, reviewed videos of the clowns at a demonstration in Tampere and found their performance wanting because they were inconsistent in sticking to their characters.\u201cIt may not be good clowning,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it certainly seems they got their message across.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Players would not say they earned additional time to play, or a bonus turn, upon reaching a certain score. They were bestowed an extra life, a new chance at existence.The Greens, who live in Colorado, spent the past three years making the game with a small team of artists and designers. Ryan Green, who is a programmer, quit his job to work on the project. It is based on their own lives and that of Joel, who died while the game was in development.\u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d is not the first memoir to arrive in the form of a video game, but it is probably the most ambitious.\u201cI feel like \u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 is one of those breakthrough moments,\u201d said John Sharp, a professor of games at the New School and the author of \u201cWorks of Game,\u201d a book about the intersection of games and art. \u201cI think we may look back at this game and see this as a touch point, a moment of rethinking what people can do with interactivity.\u201d\u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d mixes animation and magical realism to convey the Greens\u2019 emotional state during Joel\u2019s illness. There is one dragon, but much of the game consists of re-enactments of mundanities like phone messages and hospital visits. Water fills a room as a doctor says there are no more treatments for Joel\u2019s cancer.The interactions offered to the players of \u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d are relatively limited. Players mostly click to decide which part of a vignette \u2014 feeding ducks at a pond or escorting Joel through a playground \u2014 will unfold, and when to move on to the next part of the Greens\u2019 story.The restricted controls are intentional. A go-kart race through a hospital frustrated some critics, Mr. Green said, because the unwavering speed of the go-kart is dictated by the game. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can do is steer, hopefully.\u201dWithholding some control from the player was an attempt to convey feelings of helplessness and despair. \u201cOne of the great strengths of video games is that automatically a player goes into a game expecting to have some agency,\u201d Mrs. Green said. \u201cAnd it felt like the perfect way to talk about cancer, because all a parent wants is to have some agency.\u201dLike \u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d \u2014 and unlike \u201cThe Marriage\u201d and \u201cGravitation\u201d \u2014 \u201cdys4ia\u201d feels like an interactive diary by its designer rather than a gamelike metaphor. It uses familiar tropes from video games, like shooting targets, negotiating mazes and moving blocks, to express Ms. Anthropy\u2019s state of mind.Four years after the release of \u201cdys4ia,\u201d Ms. Anthropy said she feels that it has been interpreted simplistically as an \u201cempathy game\u201d that can give players the momentary sensation of what it\u2019s like to be a transgender woman.\u201cI\u2019m wary of positioning these games as educational tools, instead of just as games that are working within this form to communicate something,\u201d she said. \u201cThis idea that they have a purpose, they have a message and there\u2019s a takeaway, some neat little idea that you can walk away with, seems reductionist.\u201dMr. Sharp of the New School compared the cultural status of games in the early 21st century to that of painting during the Italian Renaissance, when it began to shift from being a functional tool to a purely aesthetic form.\u201cIt took hundreds of years to make this transition for painting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, looking at it through my art-historian goggles, it\u2019s not really a surprise that there are folks who are outside the epicenter of the games community who make the assumption that if games aren\u2019t escapist, they must be educational or therapeutic.\u201dIn \u201cPapo & Yo,\u201d Mr. Caballero\u2019s father is represented as a monster who becomes violent when he eats frogs. Rather than defeating or curing the monster, players learn to live without him.\u201cWe have proved that we can tell these stories through game design,\u201d Mr. Caballero said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t proved that you can be profitable.\u201dAbout 10,000 people have bought it, according to the website SteamSpy.

Rather than the usual biographical video that plays at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s events, the former president from \u201ca place called Hope\u201d in Arkansas starred in a video that introduced Mrs. Clinton as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cchange maker\u00e2\u0080\u009d who put the water crisis in Flint, Mich., on the map and helped children from the early years of her career.When Mrs. Clinton took the stage in the crowded atrium of an auditorium at the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, she repeatedly started sentences with \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d a name that still goes a long way in this state where he served as governor before becoming the first Arkansan in the White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBack in the early 1990s when Bill got into the White House\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said as she reminded the largely black audience that the precursor to President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Affordable Car Act was \u201cHillarycare,\u201d her failed effort to overhaul the health care system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou heard Bill talk about a program I brought to Arkansas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, explaining an early childhood education program she put into effect as the first lady of this state.And, at a time in the campaign when parts of Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy, including the 1994 crime bill and an overhaul of the welfare system, have come under criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Mrs. Clinton recited the economic successes of the Clinton Administration, including the 23 million new jobs created and the millions of Americans lifted out of poverty. The Republican candidates, she said are \u201cselling the same snake oil: trickle down economics\u201d that reversed Mr. Clinton\u2019s economic achievements.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to me that you all know, Arkansas runs deep in me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had 18 wonderful years in the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so grateful and so proud to have Arkansas connections and I will do whatever I can as president to be a good partner to this state.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton holds a home state advantage against Mr. Sanders in the Democratic contest in Arkansas on Tuesday, but the state, where Democrats got trounced in the 2014 midterm elections despite Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best efforts, will almost surely be a Republican stronghold in the general election.Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton used the opportunity in the final days before Super Tuesday to argue a Republican president would wreck the economy, dismantle Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature achievements, and make the country less safe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fighting words in a state where conservative radio dominates and Donald J. Trump has drawn enthusiastic crowds.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the leading Republican candidate, in his long line of insulting all kinds of people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said, without explicitly mentioning Mr. Trump, \u201cthat makes the job harder.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only offensive, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous because we have to build bridges in order to get people to work with us to defeat ISIS and the other terrorist networks.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier on Sunday, at a stop at a coffee shop in Nashville, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump\u2019s initial refusal to disavow the white supremacist David Duke \u201cpathetic.\u201dThe Clintons maintain an apartment overlooking the Arkansas River on the top of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in nearby Little Rock and Mr. Clinton in particular frequently visits to catch up with old friends, attend funerals, high school reunions and deliver speeches at his presidential library. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to keep our roots here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am looking forward to coming back to Arkansas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd campaigning in the general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBill will no doubt be here, too.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Netflix Aims for Family-Friendly Nostalgia With New Slate", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOver the last couple of years, as Netflix has crashed the gates of the television industry, the service has aimed to attract all age groups. It created adult-oriented dramas like \u201cNarcos\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d developed more than two dozen original series for children and started a comedy, \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d starring four actors in their 70s.Now, Netflix is prepared to go after another audience, one that it says has been forgotten and abandoned by traditional television networks: families.As prominent family-friendly programming blocks like ABC\u2019s \u201cT.G.I.F.,\u201d faded into oblivion and gave way to reality shows, \u201cit left a significant hole in the market,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, one he said his service was seeking to fill.At a time when there is more television than ever \u2014 there were 412 original scripted series last year, more than double the number seven years ago \u2014 Netflix is spending with abandon, both domestically and internationally.About 18 months ago, Netflix began to develop and invest in the kind of programming that is \u201cexciting to younger adults and more than tolerable for adults,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. It has at least six new family-oriented shows poised to hit the service by the end of 2017, including yet another revival of a fan favorite (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) and an animated series, \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d created by the filmmaker Guillermo del Toro.Ms. Holland said Netflix decided to go all-in after taking a look at rival networks\u2019 programming and surveying trends on its own service. She said family-friendly fare from the 1980s like \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\u201d was getting a strong response on Netflix.\u201cWe do see movies taking more of a front seat on the weekend and those family films climbing up the \u2018top list\u2019 ladder,\u201d Ms. Holland said. \u201cOur conclusion was families are looking for things to watch together when they\u2019re home.\u201dEven though there are more shows than ever, the sort of family-first programming that used to dominate network lineups has become increasingly elusive. (There are exceptions, including ABC comedies like \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cBlack-ish\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat.\u201d)\u201cThere used to be the family hour,\u201d said Preston Beckman, a former network executive at NBC and Fox. \u201cYou had family-friendly programming at 8 to 9, or 7 to 9 on Sundays. Is there less of that? There\u2019s less of that on the big channels. It\u2019s rarer, and it\u2019s rarer that families sit down and watch anything together.\u201dMs. Holland said she thought this was partly because of the growth of darker dramas and unconventional comedies, as well as the rising number of cable networks. As that has occurred, family viewing has been increasingly limited to sports, reality competition shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cSurvivor\u201d and live musical events like \u201cGrease: Live!\u201d and \u201cThe Wiz Live!\u201d\u201cThe proliferation of cable channels really led to niche specialization,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of a channel the whole family can watch, you saw the advent of a whole series of channels for each member of the household individually.\u201dNetflix is kicking off its new family slate this week with the reboot of \u201cFull House,\u201d the popular, syrupy comedy from the late 1980s and 1990s. \u201cFuller House,\u201d which stars many of the actors from the original series, takes the first iteration of the sitcom and flips it around: Instead of three men (including a widower) raising three girls in San Francisco, three women (including a widow) raise three children in the same house they grew up in.\u201cIt\u2019s made to be shared by families, and not necessarily by the media elite,\u201d Ms. Holland countered.Regardless, Netflix is convinced the family-friendly strategy will work for its 75 million subscribers worldwide, and it says user surveys suggest that families will watch the shows together.Netflix is also developing \u201cHaters Back Off,\u201d a show starring the popular YouTube character Miranda Sings, created by Colleen Ballinger-Evans; a revival of the old animated series \u201cVoltron\u201d; an animated series, \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d based on the Dr. Seuss book; and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d starring Winona Ryder, which Ms. Holland likened to the 1980s movie \u201cStand by Me\u201d with an added supernatural element.And if a lot of the programs tend to be inspired by or directly lifted from movies and TV shows from the 1980s and 1990s, providing that sort of catnip to Generation X viewers is not exactly an accident.\u201cThere\u2019s a little element of nostalgia at play in gaining parents\u2019 interest,\u201d Ms. Holland said. \u201cIt\u2019s also thematically the kind of programming that was made of the time. Parents are searching for the evolution of that and the 2016 version of that kind of programming. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to provide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carla Hayden Nominated to Head Library of Congress", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byIf confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Hayden, 63, would be the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position, overseeing one of the world\u2019s leading repositories of knowledge and culture and setting the agenda for the nation\u2019s libraries.She would also take the reins during a tumultuous period for the 216-year-old library, which has been without a permanent leader since September and has come to be seen as falling behind other leading libraries around the world, especially in its digital collections.\u201cDr. Hayden has devoted her career to modernizing libraries so that everyone can participate in today\u2019s digital culture,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cShe has the proven experience, dedication and deep knowledge of our nation\u2019s libraries to serve our country well, and that\u2019s why I look forward to working with her in the months ahead.\u201dMr. Obama noted that he and Michelle Obama, the first lady, have known Dr. Hayden since her days working for the Chicago Public Library.Dr. Hayden would succeed James H. Billington, a renowned Russia scholar who had held the position for nearly three decades. Dr. Billington, who turned 86 in June, was a successful fund-raiser and a champion of the library around the world and on Capitol Hill. But in recent years, he was accused of a series of management and technology failures.As librarian, Dr. Hayden would oversee a staff of about 3,100 employees, an annual budget of almost $600 million and a 160-million-item collection, most of which has not yet been digitized. She would be the 14th person to hold the position, which was created in 1802 and has been considered a lifetime appointment.The position requires congressional approval, and in a year when Republicans have all but halted the nominating process for Mr. Obama\u2019s picks, Dr. Hayden\u2019s confirmation is far from certain.The prospect that her nomination could be stalled or even rejected was already raising concern among scholars and librarians who said the institution could slip further behind without a permanent leader.\u201cI think most librarians would agree that the Library of Congress needs to take the lead in developing the digital future in a way that will benefit the general public,\u201d said Robert Darnton, a former director of the Harvard University Library. \u201cThat sounds awful pious, but behind it are conflicts of real interests,\u201d particularly between the public and commercial enterprises.Mr. Darnton was among a growing list of critics who called last summer for the resignation of Dr. Billington.In more than a dozen reports, government watchdog agencies had warned during Dr. Billington\u2019s tenure that millions of books remained piled up in warehouses, in danger of permanent damage. The reports said the library under Dr. Billington had made only a small fraction of its 24 million books available online.Dr. Hayden would be expected to address those failures, updating the library\u2019s internal systems and those used by the public, as well as provide a vision for the way the library should interact with Americans in the digital era.\u201cThis is a time for someone who understands how a library works, how a library employs technology to carry out its services and serve communities,\u201d said James G. Neal, a former head of the Columbia University library, who has worked with Dr. Hayden for decades. He said Congress should face an easy choice in confirming her.Unlike Dr. Billington and his predecessors, Dr. Hayden is not primarily a historian or a scholar, having spent the bulk of her career working for and in libraries.Before moving to Baltimore, Dr. Hayden held a handful of academic and library appointments in Pittsburgh and Chicago, where she began her career in 1973 and rose to chief librarian.In Baltimore, where she has been the chief executive of the Enoch Pratt Free Library since 1993, Dr. Hayden has overseen the modernization and expansion of the city\u2019s libraries. She has also sought to position them as centers of community, rather than just as repositories for books.Mr. Obama nominated her in 2010 to join the National Museum and Library Services Board, a position for which she gained Senate approval.\u201cBeing the first female and the first African-American really brings together two aspects of, of course, my life that make this even more significant, I think, in terms of how people view the future of libraries and what a national library can be,\u201d Dr. Hayden said. \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive. It can be a part of everyone\u2019s story.\u201dMichael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Italian\u2019s Brutal Death in Egypt Chills Relations", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Four months ago, Giulio Regeni, an Italian doctoral candidate at Cambridge University, arrived in Cairo to improve his Arabic and conduct research among the city\u2019s street vendors.In Rome, Italian officials summoned Egypt\u2019s ambassador and pressed him to allow a joint investigation into the killing. In Cairo, a government-led Italian trade delegation cut short its stay and went home.\u201cWe want the truth to come out, every last bit of it,\u201d said the Italian foreign affairs minister, Paolo Gentiloni, in an interview with the national broadcaster RAI. \u201cWe owe that much to a family that has been stricken in an irreparable way and, at the very least, has the right to know the truth.\u201dMr. Regini vanished on Jan. 25 when, on the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ultimately ousted President Hosni Mubarak, he left his apartment for a meeting with a friend at a downtown cafe. It was a day of considerable tension in Cairo: thousands of police officers were scattered across the city to halt any antigovernment protest after a weekslong crackdown that saw the police arrest activists, shutter arts spaces and search apartments.Friends said that Mr. Regeni was last seen walking toward his local metro station at about 7 p.m. The search to find him ramped up in recent days amid Internet appeals for information and as his parents flew to Cairo, but ended on Wednesday when his body was found on the desert highway leading to Alexandria.Ahmed Nagy, the Egyptian prosecutor in charge of the investigation, said Mr. Regeni was naked from the waist down and with \u201cevident signs of torture all over.\u201d The wounds, which in addition to apparent cigarette burns included small stab marks, were \u201cconcentrated around the face and body,\u201d Mr. Nagy said.An autopsy completed on Thursday afternoon indicated that he had died from \u201cinternal bleeding to the brain as a result of a beating to the head.\u201dMr. Nagy cautioned, however, that his findings were preliminary and that the forensic authorities had yet to issue a final report.Suspicions of an official hand in Mr. Regeni\u2019s death stem from the disappearance into custody of hundreds of Egyptians, often without formal arrest, over the past year, human rights groups say.Still, it would be rare for a foreigner to disappear in such a manner. And Mr. Regeni, described by friends as an open-spirited and culturally dexterous student, was conducting research that appeared to be of little threat to jittery authorities.Although Mr. Regeni\u2019s chosen subject, informal labor organization, can be politically sensitive in Egypt, he had been cautious in his work, said Rabab el-Mahdi, his supervisor at the American University in Cairo. \u201cHe steered clear of anything that was politicized,\u201d she said.Friends said they could not rule out the possibility that his death was the result of a random criminal act, a botched kidnapping or Islamist militancy, though they acknowledged having no special insight into the investigation. In August, a militant group associated with the Islamic State beheaded a Croatian man, Tomislav Salopek, after snatching him on the outskirts of Cairo.Still, there was concern that the authorities would not conduct a thorough investigation.\u201cWhat we know is that it is an accident,\u201d Alaa Azmi, the deputy head of criminal investigations in Cairo\u2019s twin province of Giza, told The Associated Press before the autopsy had been completed.Reflexive denials of foul play are common among Egyptian officials, especially in matters that could embarrass the state. Investigations into the deaths of other foreigners in recent months, including eight Mexican tourists who were killed by accident by the security forces in the Western Desert, have been criticized for a lack of transparency.The murky circumstances of Mr. Regeni\u2019s death caused a visible chill in Egypt\u2019s relations with Italy, which was the first Western country to welcome Mr. Sisi after the ouster of the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013. On Wednesday, reports that Mr. Regeni\u2019s body had been found prompted an Italian trade delegation, led by the economic development minister, Federica Guidi, to cut short a visit to Cairo. Earlier, Ms. Guida had urged Mr. Sisi to intervene personally in the case, Italian media outlets reported.On Thursday, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it expected \u201cmaximum collaboration at all levels in light of the exceptional gravity of what happened.\u201dItaly said it was asking Egypt to \u201cimmediately start a joint investigation with the participation of Italian experts.\u201dAfter a meeting with Mr. Gentiloni in London, Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said only that the two countries had agreed to increase cooperation \u201cto determine the cause of the death.\u201dOn her Facebook page, the Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif said there was \u201csomething so extra sad about a person who comes to Egypt in good faith to live and study and gets caught in this nightmare, this obtuse and brutal thuggery that\u2019s the undertone of our lives here today.\u201dMerna Thomas contributed reporting from Cairo, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Sets Yahoo on Streamlined Course", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe Internet pioneer said on Tuesday that it was open to offers for its core assets, which would represent the end of Yahoo as an independent entity. That is a shift from the company\u2019s position as recently as December.\u201cWhat I am trying to do is reassure people,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in an interview. \u201cYou could classify it as a call for patience. I am asking shareholders to understand this is a complicated situation.\u201dIn a conference call with analysts, she added: \u201cIt is going to be very busy.\u201dVery busy, and very riveting. Whether the intense, glamorous and controversial executive will get more time to fix the company promises to be one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent dramas of 2016. The next move is up to activist investors, who can try to elect a new slate to the Yahoo board.Whether it is sold or survives, Yahoo is getting smaller. It said on Tuesday it would lay off about 15 percent of its 11,000 employees. By the end of the cuts, the company said its work force would be about 42 percent smaller than it was in 2012.In addition to being smaller, Ms. Mayer said, the company would be simpler. Yahoo will shed assets, cut expenses and focus on the areas of the company that are growing. When she arrived at Yahoo after working as an executive at Google, she said, \u201cWe were sitting on $5 billion in deteriorating revenue with no clear path to growth.\u201dIn essence, she said that Yahoo was no longer deteriorating and was poised for better times \u2014 not in 2016, perhaps, but 2017.Investors seemed not quite sure how to react to the news, which came with the release of Yahoo\u2019s quarterly results. Yahoo shares, which slumped for most of Tuesday as the overall market fell, at first perked up. But in after-hours trading, the stock declined slightly.\u201cThe company is open to all options,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that Yahoo as an independent company no longer exists within two years.\u201d\u201cEach quarter is worse than the last,\u201d Starboard wrote in a letter, adding that requiring \u201canother year for shareholders to wait while the existing leadership continues to destroy value is not acceptable.\u201dStarboard did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But SpringOwl Asset Management, a firm whose investors have been publicly critical of Yahoo\u2019s management, were not satisfied with the proposed changes or happy about Ms. Mayer\u2019s attitude.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cI expected defiance, and I expected a convoluted solution,\u201d said Eric Jackson of SpringOwl. \u201cMy expectations were exceeded on both counts.\u201dHe noted that Yahoo, despite supposedly being willing to entertain offers, did not mention hiring an investment firm to facilitate the process. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this is a real shift or not,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Ms. Mayer said in the interview that the company already had retained advisers to help with the spinoff, and they would help evaluate any offers for the core assets. The board, she said, would be \u201creceptive\u201d to offers.Yahoo\u2019s language on Tuesday is likely to formally begin what could be months of inquiries from both strategic and financial suitors. Some have been open in expressing their interest: Late last year, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, said at a conference that he would look at buying Yahoo if it were put up for sale.As Ms. Mayer looks to complete her fourth year as chief executive, Yahoo stubbornly remains a marginally profitable company that is not growing. That was underlined in its fourth-quarter earnings report.Revenue came in at $1.273 billion, compared with $1.253 billion in 2014. Operating earnings were 13 cents a share, in line with forecasts. Last year, Yahoo earned 30 cents a share in the quarter.Yahoo also recorded a $4.46 billion charge in the quarter for certain businesses, including its blogging site Tumblr, which it acquired for $1 billion.Mr. Jackson of SpringOwl said that Tumblr had been Ms. Mayer\u2019s signature acquisition, and that she had increased the number of employees when she began at Yahoo. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to sharpen our focus,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she do that three and a half years ago?\u201dKenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the conference call, \u201cI do feel comfortable that we can do it this year.\u201dYahoo was a mess when Ms. Mayer arrived from Google. The executive suite was a revolving door. The company\u2019s market share in search was dropping. Yahoo Mail was an also-ran and efforts in mobile were minimal.Statistics released this week by eMarketer, a research firm, showed just how much Yahoo was struggling.In 2015, Yahoo captured $3.37 billion in digital ad revenue worldwide, or 2 percent of the market, eMarketer estimated.

{"Headline": "How Smartphones Are Killing Off the Fashion Show", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byThe first big show of New York Fashion Week will not take place in a traditional space. It is not even on the traditional schedule, which lists roughly 150 shows stretching from Thursday morning to next Thursday night.Rather, it will take place in the behemoth environs of Madison Square Garden, will feature not only a clothing collection but also an album release, and will be attended by a select group of editors, critics and retailers, as well as a much larger group of ticket-buying consumers, who will fill out the more than 18,000 seats and who are paying up to $8,584 on resale sites for the privilege. (The official price of the tickets was $50 to $135.) For those who cannot make it, the show will be filmed and screened in theaters in 25 countries, including Macedonia and Australia.The event is the debut of Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy Season 3 as well as the unveiling of his album \u201cThe Life of Pablo.\u201d While you could dismiss it as a distraction from the business at hand \u2014 a piece of theater from an outsider \u2014 something else is to happen three days later that casts the Yeezy experiment in a somewhat different light.On Sunday, Diane von Furstenberg, the founder of the brand that bears her name and, as the chairwoman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a pillar of the fashion establishment, will hold her own \u201cexperience\u201d over two floors of her meatpacking district headquarters-New York pied-\u00e0-terre (she lives on the top floor).She will invite select guests to filter in and out for over an hour (or to stay and drink and schmooze) to see vignettes of Karlie Kloss and Gigi Hadid, among other major models, acting out real-life situations, choreographed by Stephen Galloway, while wearing pieces from her new collection. Attendees will be able to talk to Ms. von Furstenberg and her team, and otherwise get up close and personal with the clothes in a way they never can with a runway.The three events reflect a tipping point.\u201cEveryone drank the Kool-Aid for too long, but it\u2019s just not working anymore,\u201d Ms. von Furstenberg said last week. \u201cWe are in a moment of complete confusion between what was and what will be. Everyone has to learn new rules.\u201dThis is turning out to be fashion\u2019s season of existential crisis. Suddenly designers are asking big questions about \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201ceffect,\u201d re-examining the system on which they rest. And they are doing it in the cold, blue light of the smartphone\u2019s glare. They are doing it, arguably, because of the smartphone\u2019s glare.Complaints about the fashion show system, a monthlong twice-yearly four-country treadmill to see clothes six months before they reach stores, have been around for a long time: Fashion week is too tiring, too old-fashioned, too crowded. But while fashion people have largely complained about the effect the system has on their own lives and jobs and creativity, today\u2019s problems are driven by a force even more powerful than simple self-interest: financial interest.Which is to say, the buying public.Interviews with dozens of retailers, editors, designers and private individuals over the last few weeks suggest that women are experiencing product fatigue. After being inundated by images and live streams from runway shows, from awards shows where the items are worn mere days after they appear on the runway, and from ad campaigns (and the making of ad campaigns), by the time these customers see the clothes in stores, the dresses and skirts and suits seem tediously familiar. Old. Over.Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said recently that he was showing a client a hot-off-the-delivery-van $11,000 embroidered jacket, only to have her wrinkle her nose and say, \u201cBut don\u2019t you have anything new?\u201d\u201cIt arrived the day before,\u201d he observed. But it had been online since last October.\u201cSocial media is the laxative of the fashion system,\u201d said Scott Galloway, the founder and chairman of the digital consultancy L2. \u201cIt makes everyone digest everything much faster: trends, product discovery.\u201dThe digital world has schooled an entire generation \u2014 called the IWWIWWIWI generation (I want what I want when I want it) by the New York consultancy Open Mind Strategy \u2014 in immediate gratification. Though the Twitter-Instagram-Facebook-Snapchat nexus started as a golden promise, a way for brands to seize control of their own messaging and cut out the middlemen of retailers and critics and communicate directly to their customer, it has created a situation in which it is no longer acceptable to many women to wait six months for something they have just seen. Especially if they can get an acceptable simulacrum at a fast-fashion brand down the street, like Zara or H&M, which was able to spot the garment via pictures and measure its success via the number of \u201clikes\u201d it achieved.And this has been confused further by the back-and-forth promotion of what is shown on the runway (products for the next season) versus what is in stores (products from the current season), and exacerbated by the rise of precollection marketing in between.\u201cIn the past, we used to see a dramatic spike of sales when the collection was delivered to stores; that trend is no longer really the case,\u201d said Paolo Riva, the chief executive of DVF.Sarah Rutson, the vice president for global buying at Net-a-Porter, said: \u201cOur psyche has changed. It is all about immediacy.\u201dSo on the one hand you have an immovable system of four interlinked geographies, and on the other you have \u201cconsumers and digital platforms that did not get the memo that fashion has four seasons,\u201d Mr. Galloway of L2 said.Though various possibilities have been floated about what to do to address the gap, with the most popular being a combination of a small industry-centered presentation for retailers and glossy magazines, followed by a \u201cconsumer relevant\u201d (Ms. von Furstenberg\u2019s words) runway show closer to the time the clothes would be available in stores, there is no clear answer. For every designer or retailer who thinks the one-two option is a good idea, there is another who thinks it is terrible: too costly, too focused on the commercial.\u201cI think it\u2019s so preposterous, I haven\u2019t even discussed it with my clients,\u201d said Pierre Rougier, an owner of PR Consulting, who works with brands like Hood by Air, J. W. Anderson and Louis Vuitton. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous, slippery slope, because you can\u2019t have a consumer-relevant show that features clothes stores have not bought. So what you see becomes what the store likes. You are effectively taking the designer out of the center and replacing him with the retailer, and new ideas do not exactly thrive at retail.\u201dWhat may work for a large brand with manufacturing muscle and its own retail stores will not work for a small brand. What may work for retailers will not necessarily work for designers, who see runway shows as the opportunity to state their vision of their clothes and who often experience collection antipathy as soon as they finish one. Consumers aren\u2019t the only ones who get tired of clothes after they\u2019ve seen them for too long.Carlo Capasa, the chairman of the Camera Nazionale della Moda, the Italian fashion industry\u2019s governing body, mentioned the above problems and added, \u201cProducing before showing doesn\u2019t avoid a leak, and it can cause a black market of information.\u201dHis counterpart in France, Ralph Toledano, the president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture, du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode, expressed even more vehement reservations.As a result, designers are casting about, with a gulf opening between bigger brands and more niche players, and between New York and London, and Milan and Paris.Thakoon Panichgul, whose clothes are often worn by Michelle Obama, has stepped off the New York schedule, having sold a majority of his brand to Bright Fame Fashion and having decided to reinvent himself as a see now/buy now brand \u2014 as did the Bill Blass brand before him. Rebecca Minkoff is working in real time and will show her spring collection this week; fall will be shown by appointment.\u201cWe have been living with a fashion calendar and system that is from another era,\u201d he said.Ms. von Furstenberg has no patience for those clinging to the past. \u201cThey are going to realize this is best for everyone,\u201d she said, noting that her show change was partly conceived as a test of her own principles. The \u201cexperience\u201d approach has the added benefit of forcing an interaction with the clothes, instead of allowing viewers to watch them speed by through their phones. \u201cAnd I am seriously considering a consumer-relevant show in September,\u201d she added.She is also selling a select group of items straight from the runway. Ralph Lauren already does this, as do Versace and Moschino (though none to the extent Burberry and Mr. Ford will in September). Versus Versace has already moved to the see-now-buy-now model. Meanwhile, V\u00eatements, the buzzy Paris brand, said that next year it would move its shows to January and July and aim to deliver clothes in-season the month afterward, thus creating its own timeline and confusing the matter yet further.\u201cIt is going to get worse before gets better,\u201d said Mr. Downing of Neiman Marcus.Which is the risk of this when-to-show-what-not-to-show fashion world angst. The irony is, amid the tension and mixed messaging, the consumer can only watch and check her phone, hoping that waiting for resolution won\u2019t be like waiting for Godot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Their Mother\u2019s Candidate", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byOpinionPerhaps no feminist of her time has done more than Ms. Steinem to pass the torch, to bridge the divide between young and old activist women. Whether you considered the feminist generation gap to be a fissure or a canyon, one thing was clear: The last person who would ever fall into it was Gloria Steinem.Then she did. Or rather was pushed. Pressed by Bill Maher, who had persistently tried to provoke an old-lady outburst about girls-these-days, Ms. Steinem said of the young women backing Bernie Sanders: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.\u2019 \u201d Never mind that fewer than two minutes earlier she\u2019d asserted, \u201cI find the young women very, very activist, and they\u2019re way, way more feminist.\u201dIt felt like a very 21st-century feminist battle: Modern idealistic individualism trouncing faded movement solidarity. In truth, the generational grudge match has been battering women\u2019s prospects for a long time, ever since women won the vote in 1920.In the 19th century, virtually every women\u2019s campaign \u2014 from abolition to temperance to social reform to suffrage \u2014 was cast as a mother-daughter compact, a movement of political \u201cmothers\u201d protecting their \u201cdaughters\u201d from male predation and passing down moral power.That alliance was disrupted in the 1920s with a consumer-driven youth revolt against the prudish Victorian matriarch and a celebration of a motherless girl culture of flapper dance-a-thons, petting parties and gin fests. The powerful new forces of Hollywood, national advertising, automobiles and urban jobs enlisted young women into a commercial version of emancipation, which substituted individual liberation for collective political authority and which promised them the \u201cfreedom\u201d to shop, to display their bodies and to smoke, to drink and drive with the boys \u2014 and throw it all in the face of their oppressive mothers.Since then, successive waves of feminists have pursued two emancipations simultaneously. Liberation from the patriarchy has also meant dethroning their mothers. In 1922, The New York Times enthused that a flapper girl \u201ctakes a man\u2019s point of view as her mother never could.\u201dThat story line resurged with every revival. The second-wave feminist poet Adrienne Rich observed that her cohort so often seemed stricken with \u201cmatrophobia.\u201d Third wavers hoisted the we\u2019re-not-our-uptight-mothers banner, in the mistaken impression that their female elders had been \u201canti-sex,\u201d and in 2008 frequently declared their aversion to Hillary Clinton by saying she \u201creminds me of my mother.\u201dCommercialism incited the original generational breakdown. The 2016 schism is expressing itself on the campaign trail. But some tenets remain the same. The insistence of older women that their daughters not be subjugated by men is interpreted as its own subjugation. The desire of young women for independence of thought recoils at older women\u2019s instructions that their independent thoughts be loyal.As young women put it in outraged commentary inspired by the Steinem-Albright flap, their feminist elders were \u201cbelittling and talking down to us.\u201d In one such Facebook eruption, that theme \u2014 \u201cWe no longer need these old school feminists commenting on our behalf\u201d \u2014 was intercut with meanspirited snipes at Ms. Steinem\u2019s and Ms. Albright\u2019s advancing years: \u201cit\u2019s clear that senility has set in to her mind,\u201d \u201cpast her best before date\u2026and has been for 30 years. Useless cow,\u201d \u201cyou vile, withered, bitter old irrelevance.\u201d As one queasy commenter eventually posted, \u201cGentle observation: this thread became a witch burning very quickly.\u201dIt\u2019s no wonder young women, and many others, flock to Senator Sanders. He\u2019s a compelling candidate with a necessary message. For some young women there\u2019s an added incentive. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s where the boys are; he\u2019s where the mothers aren\u2019t. By supporting Mr. Sanders, a young Democratic woman can also demonstrate she\u2019s thinking for herself in the voting booth, not marching in gendered lock step.Well-intentioned women on both sides of the generational divide harbor their illusions about the other. Older feminists too often think that because they fought the \u201cbig\u201d war, they set the terms of battle for all time.Too many younger feminists buy into the canard that second-wave feminism was exclusively a white, bourgeois affair, unconcerned with race and class. And both sides can be blind to the special traps that the culture sets for their demographic counterparts.Younger feminists don\u2019t fully understand how ageism can be sexist or why female elders might feel compelled to present a cautious and controlled persona on the public stage. Take, for example, the avuncular affability Mr. Sanders displays. A similar approach would backfire on any woman seeking real authority.At the same time, the older generation doesn\u2019t always comprehend what feminism may mean to their juniors, who have different burdens and concerns and are trying to fight a new war, not the old one.However young women pick their candidates these days, as my students faithfully remind me, their choices are guided by serious convictions and their feminism is shaped by experiences with systems of power that are murkier than the ones their elders confronted.But just as their elders should recognize the merits of younger women\u2019s views, young voters should understand that older feminists\u2019 concerns come from a place more genuine than millennial bashing. It\u2019s not a fight between young and fresh idealism and weary pragmatism. Older feminists, who\u2019ve witnessed a revolution or two, recall how cold and dark the night can be when the uprising implodes.Knowing that, more seasoned voters may rightly consider a romantic Democratic insurrection the height of elitist privilege when what\u2019s at stake are the lives of underprivileged women of all ages and races, women who will be the prime victims when social welfare programs are laid waste, Roe v. Wade overturned, Social Security gutted, and national health care shredded by whoever beats Mr. Sanders in November.In the long run, the feminist victory that Hillary Clinton needs to emphasize is not breaking an individualistic glass ceiling so we can finally send a woman to the Oval Office. It\u2019s defending the fragile rights of millions of women, the rights for which feminism fought so hard. That\u2019s what hangs in the balance, and what makes the current shouting match so unfortunate. That the Democratic agenda, so singularly important to women, could be scuttled by a slugfest between generations of like-minded women is a tragedy we can\u2019t afford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Organic Meat and Milk Higher in Healthful Fatty Acids", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Organic meat and milk differ markedly from their conventionally produced counterparts in measures of certain nutrients, a review of scientific studies reported on Tuesday.In particular, levels of omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for lowering the risk of heart disease, were 50 percent higher in the organic versions.However, the question of whether these differences are likely to translate to better health in people who eat organic meat and drink organic milk is sharply disputed.The two new scientific papers, published in The British Journal of Nutrition, are not the result of any new experiments, but instead employ a statistical technique called meta-analysis that attempts to pull robust conclusions out of many disparate studies.They are certain to further stir a combative debate over whether organic foods are healthier. Some scientists assert that organic and conventional foods are nutritionally indistinguishable, and others find significant benefits to organic. Many people who buy organic food say they do so not for a nutritional advantage, but because of environmental concerns and to avoid pesticides.The higher levels of omega-3, a type of polyunsaturated fat, arise not from the attributes usually associated with organic food \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the animals are not given antibiotics, hormones or genetically modified feed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but rather from a requirement that animals raised organically spend time outside. Organic milk and beef come from cattle that graze on grass, while most conventional milk and beef come from cows subsisting on grain.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something magical about organic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles M. Benbrook, an organic industry consultant who is an author of the studies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about what the animals are being fed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost of the same changes would be observed in conventionally raised animals that also grazed for the majority of their diet, the scientists said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor once, this is a pretty simple story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Benbrook said.Two years ago, Dr. Leifert led a similar review for fruits and vegetables that found organic produce had higher levels of some antioxidants and less pesticide residue than conventionally grown crops.Nutrition experts broadly agree that omega-3 fatty acids in food offer numerous health benefits. When the United States Department of Agriculture revised its dietary guidelines in 2010, it urged people to eat more seafood, which is rich in omega-3.Omega-3 is much more prevalent in grass than in grain, which is why organic livestock and milk also contain higher levels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLo and behold, we altered in some fundamental ways the nutrient intake of these animals and hence the nutrient composition of the products that we derive from those animals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Benbrook said.Centuries ago, people ate roughly equal amounts of the two fatty acids. Today, most Americans eat more than 10 times as much omega-6, which is prevalent in certain vegetable oils and thus also fried foods, as omega-3.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFar greater, and beneficial, differences in fatty acids are seen if poultry and fish replace red meat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Willett said.A shortcoming of the recommendation to eat more fish is that if everyone followed it, the rivers, oceans and lakes would be emptied of fish. Dr. Bazinet of the University of Toronto said perhaps encouraging people to switch to organic meats and milk would be \u00e2\u0080\u009ca way to kind of get at them with the foods they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already eating.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Bazinet said observational studies suggested that adding 200 milligrams a day of omega-3s to an average diet should yield health benefits. Switching to organic beef would add about 50 milligrams. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEating one grass-fed beef serving per day is not going to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.But if combined with a couple of glasses of organic milk, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit should make a difference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Bazinet said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be the hypothesis.\u00e2\u0080\u009dScientists are now trying to examine the health question more directly.Dr. Leifert cited several studies that indicated that infants of mothers who ate organic fruits and vegetables were less likely to contract some diseases. He is also conducting experiments to see if rats fed organic foods are healthier. So far, he said, it appears that crop pesticide residue does have measurable effects on the rats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hormones.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it kills you, but we do know it has an effect on hormonal balances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that makes you think a little bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Privacy Fight Tests Relationship With White House", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was relentless during a private meeting of tech giants and President Obama\u2019s top national security officials last month. Encrypted devices like the iPhone are here to stay, he insisted. Law enforcement needs to find a way to do its job in a new world.James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch pushed back, but Mr. Cook stood firm, several participants said.\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Mr. Cook told those around the table, including Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and the heads of the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cI think there has been a lack of leadership in the White House on this.\u201dDenis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, took exception and said so. Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.Either way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.Although the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.By refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.If Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.It is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.The exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.Four months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201dThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data.

The couple managed to elude capture in a stolen vehicle, then on foot, and finally in another stolen vehicle.The two were cornered overnight Friday in Milton, outside Pensacola. In an armed standoff, Mr. Fitzgerald was killed, Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County said. Ms. Harper was wounded and taken to a hospital to treat injuries to her leg and ankle.Sheriff Morgan praised what he characterized as a sprawling effort by law enforcement officials to catch the suspects of a crime spree that has dominated local news reports for days.Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper, both from Joplin, Mo., are suspected in a series of crimes that began Sunday in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where, the authorities said, they kidnapped a hotel clerk and drove off with him in his car.What followed was a spree of abductions, home invasions and robberies across Alabama, Georgia and Florida, officials said. In each case, the victims were released unharmed, but the police warned that Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper were armed and could lash out if they felt threatened. The United States Marshals Service offered $10,000 for their capture.At about 8 p.m. Thursday, the Florida authorities got a report of an armed robbery at a Famous Footwear store in Pensacola by two people whose descriptions matched that of Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper.Witnesses also gave a description of their vehicle, which was discovered hours later abandoned in a driveway about five miles from the store. At about 12:30 a.m. officials received word that the fugitives had entered a home, held its residents hostage and then fled in their red truck.Shortly after, law enforcement caught up with the truck and cornered the suspects on a narrow residential road in Milton, just east of Pensacola.Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper refused to surrender, Sheriff Morgan said, leading to an armed standoff that lasted about 15 minutes. The couple then left the vehicle and tried to enter an occupied home, Sheriff Morgan said. Escambia County officers opened fire around 1 a.m.The authorities declined to say whether Mr. Fitzgerald or Ms. Harper engaged the officers with a weapon. During the news conference on Friday, asked to confirm reports that Mr. Fitzgerald had used Ms. Harper as a shield, Sheriff Morgan paused for a moment, then said: \u201cYes. Yes.\u201dCarlen Baird-Baptista, a bail bondsman in Joplin, Mo., who had Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Harper as clients, said the two often ran into trouble with the law and struggled with methamphetamine addiction. She said Mr. Fitzgerald had three children, including a newborn.\u201cHe was a father and a son with a horrible addiction,\u201d she said on Friday.Sasha Odell, a Facebook friend of Ms. Harper\u2019s, reached out to her on the social network overnight Friday, making a plea to return to Missouri that came too late.Ms. Harper faces charges of home invasion robbery, false imprisonment and grand theft auto, said State Attorney William Eddins.Advertisement"}

The result is something close to a disaster.The elements don\u2019t mesh, and what we\u2019re left with is what\u2019s called, in the video game world, at least, a mutual kill: Each side is fatally damaged.The funny thing about \u201cThe Fugitives,\u201d however, is that you\u2019d never mistake it for the work of an untalented writer. Mr. Sorrentino has serious gifts, and his observations about sex, envy, writer\u2019s block, marriage and what\u2019s left of New York City\u2019s literary world hint at the formidable novel this might have been. There\u2019s a lot of gleaming machinery here that is never assembled \u2014 machinery a lesser writer wouldn\u2019t have around in the first place.\u201cThe Fugitives\u201d is the story of Alexander Mulligan III, known as Sandy, a successful Brooklyn writer who escapes to small-town Michigan to try to finish a stalled novel. He is also escaping a domestic scandal involving an affair, a divorce, a pregnancy and a suicide.The sexual outlaw is now a sexual outcast. \u201cYou\u2019d think after Burroughs had put a bullet through his wife\u2019s head, after Mailer had stabbed his,\u201d the demented comedian in Sandy comments, \u201cI\u2019d catch a break.\u201d Instead, a \u201cpersecuting spirit\u201d all but hounds him out of Brooklyn.Once in Michigan, he finds a house and sets up a literary war room. His novel is long overdue, so he lays in enough Office Depot goodies, of a luxury sort, to knock the thing out in a few months. Here we find him midappraisal: \u201cI also had an Aeron chair, a laptop with separate cordless keyboard and mouse, an external hard drive, a printer, a scanner/fax/copier, a smartphone, an iPod and a stereo dock, a modem, a high-speed Internet connection, and a wireless router to connect it all; everything the reclusive author needed except a briar pipe and a walking stick.\u201dWhat he lacks is his muse. His novel is not merely stalled; privately, he\u2019s given it up for dead. He fritters away his days, watching pornography, listening to playlists of thrillingly sad music and ingesting beers before lunch. His publisher is threatening to demand that he return his advance; he\u2019s living on a grant that may be cut off.We\u2019ve met men like Sandy a hundred times. The lightly grizzled midcareer novelist as a lout, fumbling toward grace, is among the oldest stories. But if it\u2019s a tired story, so is boy meets girl and \u201croad trip.\u201d These narrative forms are elastic sacks into which fine spirits can still be poured.Mr. Sorrentino pours some very fine spirits indeed. For example, Sandy would despise my paragraph, just above, in which I suggest some similarities between author and hero. \u201cA novel should be like the calling card of an unknown killer,\u201d he writes \u2014 deadly and anonymous.The author has intuitive things to say about the online world. Facebook is regarded by Sandy as that \u201cnice smooth interface between you and all the bad habits and ancient disharmonies.\u201d He sends up the sort of book parties held in art galleries with \u201chigh-res photos of vulvas on the walls.\u201dYet Sandy\u2019s story is not allowed to accrue layers of meaning and wit. Before long, he meets Kat, a plucky young reporter from a Chicago newspaper. She\u2019s on the trail of a lowlife, nicknamed Jackie Crackers, who may or may not have stolen already skimmed money from an Indian casino.Jackie Crackers also may or may not have reinvented himself as a Native American storyteller who appears at local fairs and libraries. Trust me when I say: You will not care about Jackie Crackers.Kat and Sandy meet cute, have blazing sex (back in Chicago, she is married to a \u201cfroglike\u201d food critic) and get into ridiculous scrapes involving tough guys and handguns and shallow graves out in the woods.The dialogue follows them right off the deep end. Over sandwiches and milkshakes, Sandy begins to make pronouncements like: \u201cIt turned out Rilke was right, that fame is no more than the quintessence of all the misunderstandings collecting around a new name.\u201d Kat\u2019s editor back in Chicago makes the same kind of pretentious sucking sounds.Gore Vidal had no patience with anyone who, like Sandy, complained of writer\u2019s block. About such men and women, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to be doing this. Plenty more where you came from.\u201dBut Mr. Sorrentino is clearly meant to be doing this \u2014 writing novels, that is. Even if, in \u201cThe Fugitives,\u201d he\u2019s spinning his outsize wheels.The FugitivesBy Christopher Sorrentino322 pages. Simon & Schuster. $26.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Schools Wonder: How White Is Too White?", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byThe school \u2014 along with six others in New York City \u2014 is part of a new Education Department initiative aimed at maintaining a racial and socioeconomic balance at schools in fast-gentrifying neighborhoods. For the first time the department is allowing a group of principals to set aside a percentage of seats for low-income families, English-language learners or students engaged with the child welfare system as a means of creating greater diversity within their schools.The continuing segregation of American schools \u2014 and the accompanying achievement gap between white, middle-class students and poorer minority children \u2014 has become an urgent matter of debate among educators and at all levels of government. Last week, President Obama lent his weight to the issue when he included in his budget a $120 million grant program for school integration aimed at de-concentrating poverty.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Carmen Fari\u00f1a, the schools chancellor, have disappointed school diversity advocates by failing to make integration a priority. The set-asides plan, approved by Ms. Fari\u00f1a in November, was the first attempt at addressing the issue across multiple schools.All of the schools involved enroll children by lottery, rather than having a school zone.In its early years, Arts and Letters was more than 90 percent black and Hispanic, reflecting the Brooklyn neighborhoods around it, including Bedford-Stuyvesant, Clinton Hill and Fort Greene. More than 80 percent of its students qualified for free or reduced lunch.Now, Arts and Letters has become one of Brooklyn\u2019s hottest schools. Half of the school\u2019s kindergartners are white; a mere 12 percent qualify for free or reduced lunch. That has its principal, John O\u2019Reilly, worried.\u201cI love the fact that so many white affluent families would want to send their children to my school,\u201d he said recently, before rushing off to give another tour. \u201cBut I know the impact it has on the diversity of my school.\u201dInstead, their schools are becoming magnets for middle-class families moving into gentrifying neighborhoods who prefer them to their local zoned schools. The principals are concerned that their schools will \u201ctip\u201d over into majority white, middle-class schools.They hope the new program will help them maintain more balanced populations.But educators in New York and across the country are not in agreement about what integration should look like. In 2007, a United States Supreme Court ruling declared school sorting by race unconstitutional in two school districts, Seattle and Louisville, Ky.In 2013, the city approved a plan that allowed Public School 133 in fast-gentrifying Gowanus to set aside seats for English-language learners and students who qualify for free or reduced lunch. Those criteria are generally used as proxies for race in trying to achieve integration. Many advocates believed this would lead to more set-aside plans.That did not happen.A strong body of research, beginning in the 1960s with the now-famous Coleman Report, suggests that low-income students do better academically when exposed to middle-class ones. Numerous other studies suggest that middle-class students do not see a decrease in achievement when they go to school with poorer students, and may in fact benefit in nonacademic ways.But how best to integrate remains up for debate.Mr. O\u2019Reilly, the Arts and Letters principal, has accepted that as a benchmark. He will give priority to students who qualify for free or reduced lunch for 40 percent of his seats.But Ms. Zuckerman, the Castle Bridge School principal, challenges the notion that her school needs a large percentage of middle-class families to be a successful place of learning. \u201cI\u2019m good with 20 to 25 percent,\u201d she said.At Castle Bridge, students from households in which a family member is incarcerated get priority for 10 percent of the seats, and low-income students get priority for 60 percent.The principals say the set-asides are needed, because once a school is viewed as desirable by middle-class families, their networking capabilities and social capital are far more powerful than any outreach the schools can do to attract lower-income families. All it takes, they say, is a few posts on Facebook, some word of mouth at cocktail parties, preschool fund-raisers and neighborhood playgrounds for a school to be inundated with applications from high-earning families. Those can far outnumber the ones coming from lower-income minority families, so even though seats are given out by lottery, the population can quickly shift.This school year, around 15 percent of the population is white and more than 5 percent is Asian. Last year, it had a Parent Teacher Association president who was white.Ms. Soto says the level of integration so far is encouraging, giving all her students a broader understanding of the world around them. But she worries that as Crown Heights undergoes a demographic shift \u2014 her school used to serve free and reduced lunch to almost all its students, and now serves it to 64 percent of them \u2014 the school will no longer be able to reach as many of the poor children she got into education to help. She is allowed to set aside 20 percent of her seats for English-language learners and children in the child welfare system.At the 28-year-old Brooklyn New School, which once had race-based set-asides to help it draw low-income families from Carroll Gardens and Red Hook, now close to half the students are white or Asian, less than a third get free or reduced lunch, and many families hail from the area\u2019s brownstones and condos or drive in from Park Slope or nearby Dumbo. Anna Allanbrook, the principal and founder, mourns the past. \u201cPart of the vision has been lost,\u201d she said.The pilot program will allow her once again to give priority to low-income students after siblings and current pre-K students, helping to lure back some of the families for whom the school was originally designed.Principals at these schools say they know that middle-class families often bring with them higher test scores, making the schools look better on paper. But several added that chasing test scores was not what had drawn them into education.\u201cWe know it can be done,\u201d Mr. Reardon said.Takiesha Robinson, the mother of a third grader and a pre-kindergartner at Ms. Soto\u2019s school, said she appreciated the access her third grader had gotten to white and Asian families since the school reopened. Ms. Robinson, who is black, says her daughter now knows about Hanukkah, understands what a menorah is and knows the difference between being Pakistani and Chinese.\u201cI can really, really see the difference,\u201d she said.Still, Ms. Robinson and other parents said they did not want to see the school \u201cturn all white.\u201dFor some white parents at the school, that is understandable.Emily Cowan, a freelance artist and social worker, said she was willing to even sacrifice her own kindergartner\u2019s slot next year to \u201cpreserve that diversity,\u201d though it would mean sending her son to a different school next year.For others, it is a bitter pill.The idea of keeping the school diverse \u201ctotally jibes with my politics,\u201d said Mark Schwartz, the owner of a liquor store in Prospect-Lefferts Garden, Brooklyn, who also has a kindergartner at the school. \u201cBut what if it means we lose out on this opportunity?\u201dAn article on Wednesday about an initiative by New York City\u2019s Education Department aimed at maintaining a racial and socioeconomic balance at schools in fast-gentrifying areas included outdated information about Arthur Mattia\u2019s connection to the Children\u2019s School in Brooklyn, one of the seven schools taking part.

{"Headline": "U.N. Agency Hires Wife of Top Figure in Syrian War to Assist the Displaced", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byHer appointment has led critics to question the aid agency\u2019s impartiality.Jennifer Leaning, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, questioned what she called the \u201coptics\u201d of hiring a senior Syrian government official\u2019s wife as a consultant on something as sensitive as mental health. Not least, Ms. Leaning said, it would call into question any data Mrs. Mekdad gathers on the mental health of Syrians displaced by a war her husband has helped prosecute.\u201cAt this point it reflects a degree of tone-deafness that is not appropriate,\u201d Ms. Leaning said.The W.H.O. chief in Damascus, Elizabeth Hoff, defended the choice, saying that her team includes people from all political camps. \u201cI didn\u2019t recruit them based on their names or their connections,\u201d Ms. Hoff said. \u201cI also have people in my office who are strongly with the opposition.\u201dMrs. Mekdad, she went on, plays no \u201cprominent\u201d role in the office, and was brought on as a consultant for the mental health assessment project after she had served in the United Nations resident representative\u2019s office in Syria.United Nations aid agencies can work in a country only with the blessings of the government. And they are often accused of bending over backward to satisfy the demands of that government to be able to operate.In Syria, even with Mrs. Mekdad\u2019s involvement, it\u2019s not as if the health agency has had an easy time. According to Ms. Hoff, Syrian security forces have repeatedly taken medical supplies from aid convoys going into rebel-held areas, including rehydration salts, which are used to treat children with diarrhea.On Wednesday, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator for Syria, Stephen O\u2019Brien, told the Security Council that the health ministry had prohibited aid convoys from reaching around 30,000 people in recent weeks.It is part of a pattern that United Nations officials have long described as government obstructionism. Mr. O\u2019Brien said United Nations convoys this year have reached less than a quarter of 487,000 Syrians long cut off from food and medicines. \u201cHumanitarian operations cannot continue to be bogged down by unnecessary and unacceptable restrictions, obstructions and deliberate delays that are costing people their lives,\u201d he said.The frustration with the United Nations in Syria stems in part from the fact that, for the first three years of the conflict, its agencies refused to send humanitarian convoys into opposition-held areas because the government wouldn\u2019t allow it.At the time, United Nations officials said privately that if they delivered aid to areas controlled by groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad without an explicit nod from the Security Council, they would lose their access to those in need who lived in government-held areas.Aid started flowing into rebel-held parts of the country only after the Security Council authorized it in 2014. In December 2015, United Nations convoys delivered food for 2.5 million people.Still, even 18 months after that Security Council measure, the United Nations finds it difficult reaching more than 4.5 million people living in what it calls besieged and hard-to-reach areas. United Nations officials have repeatedly appealed to the government to lift obstacles.Syrian doctors have criticized W.H.O. too, pointing out that, until recently, the agency has been all but silent about the attacks on hospitals and health centers in opposition-held areas.An advocacy group, Physicians for Human Rights, has documented more than 346 attacks on hospitals and health centers since the war began, many in the last few months, as the violence has escalated. The W.H.O. has recently issued two public statements.\u201cW.H.O. could have done more earlier, for sure,\u201d said Tawfiq Chamaa, of the Union of Syrian Medical Organizations, which operates clinics in opposition areas. \u201cThey are doing better than before but we would like to have all the U.N.-related structures to help us more, to obtain humanitarian corridors and stop bombing hospitals.\u201dFor his part, Mr. O\u2019Brien, insisted that the United Nations strives to deliver aid in \u201ca neutral and impartial way\u201d and that the charges of coziness with the government were unfounded.The W.H.O. in Damascus has not specifically said why it chose Mrs. Mekdad to carry out the mental health assessment: There are no publicly available documents that show her qualifications, nor any scholarly papers written by her on the subject.An article on Feb. 25 about questions concerning the World Health Organization\u2019s hiring of the wife of the deputy foreign minister of Syria \u2014 a powerful defender of the government\u2019s war effort \u2014 to help assess the mental health of Syrians forced to flee their homes misstated the number of attacks on hospitals and health centers in Syria that Physicians for Human Rights has documented since the war began. It is 346, not 386. Because of an editing error, a picture credit with the article misidentified the photographer in some editions. The picture, of food aid delivered near Damascus, was taken by Abd Doumany, not Amer Almohibany. While the text error was promptly corrected online, editors failed to follow through on the print correction for that and the credit error.Maher Samaan contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

He said the agency was investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire and the death of Ms. Aquino\u2019s daughter, Kalenah Muldrow.Ms. Aquino, 20, was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on Wednesday night on misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child.Prosecutors said during the arraignment that Ms. Aquino had gone out around midnight on Monday, leaving Kalenah alone in the top-floor apartment where they lived. About six hours later, on Tuesday morning, the apartment caught fire, the authorities said.Ms. Aquino returned home after the fire was under control and called her mother to say that Kalenah had been inside the apartment, the authorities said, adding that Ms. Aquino\u2019s mother called 911 to report that fact.Kalenah was found unconscious under a bed and pronounced dead by emergency workers, the police said.\u201cThe defendant left the child home without proper care,\u201d a prosecutor, Tziyonah Langsam, told Judge Curtis Farber at the arraignment. She added that Ms. Aquino initially misled investigators when providing written and videotaped statements.Ms. Aquino first said she had left Kalenah with a babysitter, Ms. Langsam said. She then said she had gone out expecting a babysitter to arrive after making arrangements through Facebook, the prosecutor said. Phone records, however, showed that it had been weeks since Ms. Aquino communicated with the person she identified as the babysitter, Ms. Langsam said. At that point, the prosecutor said, Ms. Aquino acknowledged that she had left the child unattended.Ms. Langsam said no one else was believed to be near Kalenah in Ms. Aquino\u2019s third-floor apartment when the fire broke out and that the building\u2019s second floor was vacant. The closest adult, Ms. Aquino\u2019s 89-year-old grandfather, was on the first floor at the time of the fire, Ms. Langsam said, adding that he had not gone upstairs.Some details of Ms. Aquino\u2019s past emerged during the arraignment. Ms. Langsam said she had been convicted last year of disorderly conduct, assault and robbery. Ms. Aquino\u2019s lawyer, Jacqueline Caruana, said that Ms. Aquino had only one conviction, for disorderly conduct, and had performed two days of community service as a penalty.

After three and a half years as chief, she has shown little progress in fixing the 21-year-old company, whose many challenges have been a Waterloo for several leaders.Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, is among those who have been pushing for radical change.\u201cThings are moving in the right direction, and we\u2019re happy about that,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday.But he added that it was unclear whether the board would agree to any transactions. Mr. Jackson and other investors said they still expected Starboard to field a rival slate of directors for election at Yahoo\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting to keep the pressure on the board for a sale.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.In a statement on Friday, the board said it was \u201cthoroughly committed to exploring strategic alternatives while simultaneously supporting management and the employees in their implementation of Yahoo\u2019s strategic plan.\u201d It added, \u201cWe believe that pursuing these complementary paths is in the best interests of our shareholders and will maximize value.\u201dYahoo hinted that it would be more interested in selling parts of the business rather than all of it. \u201cIn addition to the reverse spin, there are strategic alternatives that could help us achieve the separation, while strengthening our business,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement.Some of Yahoo\u2019s divisions, such as its small-business services unit, have already been designated as tangential to the company\u2019s principal business.Tumblr could also be cleaved off and would be attractive to outside buyers \u2014 Facebook was interested in the New York-based blogging service before Yahoo bought it in 2013 for $1.1 billion \u2014 but it also helps prop up Yahoo\u2019s weak use numbers, especially among young people.Flurry, the mobile analytics business that Yahoo bought two years ago, also would be appealing. It is used by about 800,000 independent apps and would give a strategic buyer an instant entry with software developers. But Yahoo has been integrating its ad sales technology with Tumblr, and unwinding that would be complex.Robert Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said Wall Street was unlikely to be satisfied with a few asset sales.\u201cBy far, what investors want and will push for is the cleanest, fastest solution that optimizes value, and that is selling the core,\u201d Mr. Peck said.The board has tapped financial advisers, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Paul J. Taubman\u2019s firm, PJT Partners, and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to help with the review process.The committee will recommend to the board what it determines to be the best transaction \u2014 if one exists.The company declined to make any other additional disclosures about the sales process.Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco, and Leslie Picker from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lindsey Vonn Suffers Hairline Fracture to Knee", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byLindsey Vonn, the American skier who is leading the overall World Cup standings as part of a spectacular comeback season, sustained a hairline fracture of her left knee Saturday during a high-speed crash in a super-G race at Soldeu-el Tarter, Andorra.\u201cGot caught in the soft snow today and crashed pretty hard,\u201d Vonn wrote. \u201cX-rays showed I have a hairline fracture in my left knee and will get an M.R.I. Monday. I will wait and see how I feel tomorrow to decide if I can race.\u201dVonn has 76 World Cup victories, 10 fewer than Ingemar Stenmark, who specialized in the giant slalom and slalom in the 1970s and \u201980s. Vonn, who has won races in five disciplines, already has more career World Cup victories than any other woman.Vonn had won nine races this season and was leading Saturday\u2019s super-G when she fell onto her left hip late in her run. She had a minor bobble on a right-footed turn and two turns later slid below the customary race path, which brought her right ski in contact with a patch of heavier, ungroomed snow. Earlier Saturday, the event had been delayed for three hours by high winds and snowfall. Workers pushed the new snow to the edges of the racecourse. Vonn has had multiple serious injuries and several frightening, tumbling crashes. She nearly missed out on competing in the 2006 Turin Olympics after a harrowing spill days before the Games were to begin.In 2013, she tore two major ligaments in her right knee, including the anterior cruciate ligament, when she landed awkwardly after a jump and somersaulted down the mountain during the super-G at the Alpine world championships. She also sustained a tibia fracture.With the 2014 Sochi Olympics a year away, Vonn recovered quickly, eager to defend the gold medal she had won in the downhill at the 2010 Olympics. Then, during a training run in Colorado in November 2013, she tore her reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament, knocking her out of the Olympics.Vonn made a successful return to racing last winter but broke her left ankle while training in New Zealand in August.Saturday\u2019s race was won by Federica Brignone of Italy, with Laurenne Ross of the United States finishing in second.Vonn, who has won the overall title four times, holds an 8-point lead over Lara Gut of Switzerland in the overall standings. Vonn has already clinched the season\u2019s downhill title \u2014 a record 20th World Cup championship \u2014 but if she has to miss any extended time because of Saturday\u2019s knee fracture, Gut will have an opportunity to build an insurmountable lead in the overall race. Earning his second career win, Kilde finished in 1 minute 29.89 seconds on the Hannes Trinkl course, ahead of Bostjan Kline of Slovenia by 0.24 of a second.The overall World Cup leader, Marcel Hirscher of Austria, finished 0.35 back in third to increase his lead over his closest competitor, Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway, to 263 points.

{"Headline": "Cornell\u2019s Plan to Merge Hotel School Gets an Icy Reception", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byThe school is considered the Harvard of hospitality programs, consistently topping best-of lists and rankings. Its graduates, school officials like to say, do not just run individual hotels, they own entire hotel chains or groups of restaurants. Among its alumni are Drew Nieporent, the celebrated New York City restaurateur whose crown jewels include Tribeca Grill and Nobu; Ted Teng, president of Leading Hotels of the World; and Andrew H. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation.So perhaps it was no surprise that alumni and students reacted with something akin to a tirade on the hotel rating site TripAdvisor, when Cornell\u2019s board of trustees recently voted to establish a new College of Business. The idea, university officials say, is to fold the hotel school, along with two other business schools, into the new college, strengthening the individual programs in the process.\u201cVery disappointed in Cornell\u2019s decision,\u201d Paul F. Foley, class of 1974, lamented on a Facebook page set up to protest the move. \u201cThe decision and its process was fatally flawed from its inception.\u201dAfter the trustees\u2019 vote, Liz Longstreet, who graduated in 2008, wrote, \u201cI literally feel sick.\u2019\u2019But the hotel school\u2019s stakeholders were especially vocal.\u201cWe want to keep our identity as \u2018hotelies,\u2019\u201d Alec Ulnick, a junior at the hotel school, said, as he worked the reception desk at the Statler on a recent weeknight.\u201cYou have to understand that the people who graduated from this place are attached to it intellectually and emotionally,\u2019\u2019 said Steven Carvell, an associate professor at the hotel school and its associate dean for academic affairs. \u201cThey have an adoration for the school that is different.\u201dSince a vote by the trustees last month authorizing the College of Business, Dr. Kotlikoff and the university president, Elizabeth Garrett, have sought to explain the rationale behind the new college and reassure agitated alumni. In emails and forums, they have argued that a business college encompassing the three schools will elevate Cornell\u2019s business profile.After the consolidation, which is expected to unfold during the 2016-17 academic year, the Cornell school will rank third in terms of size of its research faculty, behind Harvard Business School and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, none of the three individual schools at Cornell, each with 45 to 60 faculty members, rank in the top 10.As a result of the merger, Dr. Kotlikoff said, opportunities for new interdisciplinary programs will emerge from the schools\u2019 collective expertise in agriculture, food security, sustainability, hospitality, finance and technology.The business college should also help Cornell recruit faculty members, Dr. Kotlikoff said.\u201cThe whole attraction to faculty when you come to a program is: \u2018Whom can you work with? What are the collaborative possibilities?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much better sell if you can say you\u2019re coming into an overall department with lots of colleagues working on different things.\u201dTo placate alumni, officials have pledged that the schools will retain their names and that all three will have their own deans.Still, worry persists among alumni like Jan D. Freitag, a 1997 hotel school graduate and now a hotel analyst. \u201cWe were taken aback,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some fear that the special feeling in the hotel school is going to be rolled up into a larger entity.\u201dMr. Nieporent, a member of the class of 1977 who has opened 39 restaurants in the past 30 years, said, \u201cA vast majority of the alumni certainly would have preferred that it be kept the way it was.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cif it\u2019s a fait accompli, I\u2019m going to be positive about the future. I\u2019m confident that going forward the school won\u2019t lose its eminence.\u201dOthers object to the process itself, saying the administration sprang news of the trustees\u2019 vote on distracted students and faculty in mid-December, during final exams and before the holidays. There were no public meetings or faculty committees organized to deliberate the change. Three governing bodies, the Faculty Senate, University Assembly and Student Assembly, all voted to ask the trustees to delay the vote until March.\u201cLike professors at other colleges and universities, faculty at Cornell want to be consulted on major decisions,\u201d said Michael Fontaine, acting dean of the faculty and an associate professor of classics.Dr. Kotlikoff countered that the faculty and others had for years weighed in on the fragmented nature of the business programs at Cornell, through task forces and committees. \u201cThere has been a lot of previous faculty involvement, but it didn\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d he said.In authorizing the new business college, Dr. Kotlikoff said, the trustees merely created a framework. \u201cWe asked the trustees to create an empty vessel and enable this process, which is so difficult in academics,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow we will get the faculty to work through the governance details that only they can determine.\u201d\u201cWithin Cornell, each of the business schools is a really strong 150-pound sumo wrestler, but they are up against some 350-pound sumo wrestlers,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cTo have Johnson, Dyson and the Hotel schools come together under a business college will give them a seat at the table.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iowa Caucuses, Victory Extends Beyond First Place", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "So that was interesting. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fought Hillary Clinton to a tie, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida polished his bronze medal and turned a would-be concession speech into a victory lap, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas marched to victory, and Donald J. Trump was faced with a loss he had to explain in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the most unanticipated result. Mrs. Clinton had seemed a clear winner in the last Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics, and her team felt confident of victory heading into the night. But Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote share was surprising to say the least and created the thing Mrs. Clinton least enjoys in her races \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the element of surprise. Mrs. Clinton, who is behind in New Hampshire, now needs to fare well in the Nevada caucuses this month. And Mr. Sanders, who has already raised tens of millions of dollars with his populist message, seems newly energized and ready for a long fight.As for the Republicans, Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory validated his campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal predictions. Mr. Rubio outperformed his poll numbers and heads into New Hampshire with a potential bounce. He shrewdly gave his speech before either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump, and offered essentially a version of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomeback kid\u00e2\u0080\u009d speech from Bill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-place finish in New Hampshire in 1992. Mr. Cruz emerges as the strong favorite for anti-establishment voters and conservatives. Mr. Rubio potentially overtakes Mr. Trump and becomes the establishment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best chance to stop Mr. Cruz, who now heads into New Hampshire having defied late predictions that he would lose in Iowa. But Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deeply negative attacks on Mr. Cruz, raising questions about his citizenship, appear to have backfired. Mr. Trump handled his second-place finish stoically, thanking Iowans and insisting he loved the state. But though the polls were wrong to show him winning, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shake his reliance on public surveys, noting that one in New Hampshire shows him up by 28 points. But that was conducted before the Iowa caucuses. There are several candidates vying for support in New Hampshire who are strong fits for the state, and Mr. Trump will face fresh pressure to show he can compete.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Italian Lawmakers\u2019 Vote on Same-Sex Civil Unions Stalls", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 The Italian Senate began voting Tuesday afternoon on a contentious bill that for the first time would allow civil unions for same-sex couples.The parliamentary debate was suspended after a raucous three-hour discussion during which tempers flared and lawmakers hurled insults.\u201cWe won\u2019t permit stadium chants,\u201d said Pietro Grasso, the president of the Senate, who adjourned discussion until Wednesday morning on the request of several senators.Tuesday\u2019s discussion got bogged down over the admission of a government amendment that would effectively quash other proposed amendments to the bill.The bill includes an especially controversial measure \u2014 the possibility for a gay couple to adopt a child if one of the partners is the biological parent \u2014 that some argue would pave the way to surrogacy, which is banned in Italy.During a television talk show on Tuesday, Ms. Lorenzin proposed \u201ccriminal sanctions to discourage surrogacy,\u201d confirming her opposition to stepchild adoption because it \u201cencourages surrogacy.\u201dItaly is one of a few countries in Western Europe that do not recognize same-sex unions in any form. Even if the present bill passed, it would fall short of allowing gay marriage.Last July, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Italy\u2019s failure to recognize same-sex unions violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Noting that the Italian Constitutional Court has \u201crepeatedly pointed out the need for legislation to recognize and protect same-sex relationships,\u201d the European Court found that Italy had \u201cfailed to fulfill its obligation\u201d to ensure that same-sex couples had \u201ca specific legal framework providing for the recognition and protection of their union.\u201dSome supporters of the measure argue that the Vatican has exercised undue influence on lawmakers to block gay rights legislation, but Pope Francis has not weighed in, at least not publicly, and the Italian Episcopal Conference has not been unanimous in its condemnation of the bill.Instead, right-wing opposition parties, with the Northern League at the forefront, have been the most vocal opponents, along with some members of Mr. Renzi\u2019s minority coalition partner, the New Center Right Party, which has created tension within the majority.The stepchild adoption provision has proved to be the most contentious issue both in Parliament and among the public, where support for that part of the measure is considerably lower than support for civil unions.Voting was expected to end on Tuesday evening. The bill will then pass to the lower house, where Mr. Renzi\u2019s party has a wider majority and it should pass easily.Advertisement"}

Both were question-and-answer sessions, according to people who attended, and at the second, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs, was among her questioners. In June of that year she was also paid for an additional event that included Goldman and other groups. She was paid $225,000 for each.Mrs. Clinton mainly offered what one attendee called \u00e2\u0080\u009ca tour of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d covering her observations on China, Iran, Egypt and Russia. This person said Mrs. Clinton also discussed the dysfunction in Washington, how to repair America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing in the world after the government shutdown and also talked a bit about the Affordable Care Act, which had had a difficult rollout.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being in the pocket of Wall Street and big business by noting that she has received major donations from them and was paid more than $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.She has struggled to explain why she took that money, saying at a CNN forum on Wednesday night: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.

{"Headline": "Sisterhood, Beyond the Script", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byMembers of the crew started a pool \u201cto see how long it would be before we hated each other,\u201d Samantha Massell, who plays Hodel, said during a pre-theater dinner recently with Alexandra Silber and Melanie Moore, the other members of the coven. \u201cThey were like, \u2018I\u2019ll give it two weeks before they kill each other.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey were like \u2018They\u2019re too close,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Moore, who plays Chava. \u201c\u2018They love each other too much. At some point, it will be volatile.\u2019\u201dThose stagehands lost a tidy sum. The women\u2019s matching bracelets, an opening night gift from Ms. Massell, sum it all up: They\u2019re embossed with the Hebrew word for \u201csister.\u201dSister relationships often get short shrift in the theater, and perhaps the best known among them, the one involving King Lear\u2019s daughters Regan, Goneril and Cordelia, wouldn\u2019t exactly make a mother proud. And Irina, Masha and Olga of \u201cThe Three Sisters\u201d have their own problems.But currently, on and Off Broadway, sisters are a focus of the action, in some instances the fulcrum. And to borrow a lyric from Irving Berlin, there were never such devoted sisters. The \u201csisterhood is powerful\u201d theme, it seems, has equal resonance offstage as well as on, in defiance of every clich\u00e9 and stereotype about actresses. (More about this in a minute.)How to explain the abundance of sister plays on New York stages? It could be coincidence, of course. Or perhaps as Andrus Nichols, a co-founder of Bedlam Theater, speculates, it could be a response to a pervasive sense of isolation and disconnection. \u201cPeople are always on their phones and watching their friends grow up on Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that there\u2019s a surge of interest in sisterly bonds. We\u2019re looking for that specific kind of warmth and loyalty, specifically the nurturing female side.\u201dOr perhaps it has something to do with a popular theme in American society: women and economic power, said Julie Crosby, the former artistic director of the Women\u2019s Project Theater. \u201cIn one way or another, there\u2019s an economic basis to all these plays,\u201d Ms. Crosby said, \u201cand the sisters are trying to deal with basic issues of survival in very practical ways,\u201d generally through marriage.What they\u2019re playing onstage, they\u2019re living offstage too, the actresses in these plays say. \u201cIt took nothing for Joaquina and me to become sisters onstage,\u201d said Ms. Erivo of \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d turning for confirmation to Ms. Kalukango, who was hanging out in her dressing room on a recent evening before the show. \u201cI don\u2019t think we even had to try.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my big sister onstage and off,\u201d Ms. Kalukango said. \u201cI had an allergic reaction onstage during one performance. My eyes were watering when we were singing a duet, and Cynthia wiped away my tears. And when we get offstage, she\u2019s still such a caretaker. She\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m O.K. She\u2019ll give me tea.\u201dWhen Kate Hamill and Ms. Nichols were cast as Marianne and Elinor Dashwood in Bedlam\u2019s \u201cSense and Sensibility,\u201d it helped that they were old friends and, at the time, apartment mates.The ease with which these actresses bond may come down to canny choices during auditions. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of casting I\u2019ve always tried to follow \u2014 working with people I like and who like each other,\u201d said Thomas Kail, the director of \u201cHamilton.\u201dSpeaking of the women who play the Schuyler sisters, Mr. Kail said: \u201cWhen we were at the Public Theater with \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 the room the three of them had was spilling over with joy. And when we were reviewing the dressing room assignment for the Richard Rodgers Theater, I knew the corridor I was going to give them. My joke was that their three doors would never be closed.\u201dIn any case, the benefits of this affection flow in two directions.

Or is hatred the lot of the weak?\u201d Yuri Biryukov, a Ukrainian activist and blogger, posed these questions on Facebook after recounting his feelings about bumping into ordinary Russians during a recent vacation.\u201cI just felt squeamish about seeing them,\u201d he wrote in a post that drew thousands of \u201clikes\u201d from Ukrainians and outraged many Russians. \u201cI had the feeling one has when looking at a pest the second before reaching for a shoe ...\u201dYes, this is how popular discourse sounds these days. Even when they aren\u2019t shooting at each other, Ukrainians and Russians exchange venomous comments on social networks.Meanwhile, despite the bile, the faint promise of a political settlement has reappeared at the turn of the year. Russia seems to be engaging more closely in the cease-fire process. President Vladimir Putin has appointed a new envoy to the contact group on Ukraine and has discussed the crisis with President Obama on the phone; talks behind closed doors were held between Victoria Nuland, a United States assistant secretary of state, and Vladislav Surkov, Mr. Putin\u2019s aide on Abkhasia and South Ossetia and also, apparently, on Ukraine.Leonid Kuchma, a former president of Ukraine and his country\u2019s envoy to the contact group, said recently that the negotiations needed to continue in the present format. He also suggested that he would welcome China getting involved in the process.Commentators may be debating whether these efforts reflect a new determination to reach a conclusive resolution, but experience suggests that even if Moscow does want a settlement, it only wants an interim one. The Kremlin clearly prefers the conflict to keep simmering because being able to turn the heat on and off (not just in Ukraine but in the Middle East too) is Russia\u2019s only functioning foreign policy lever. But the price for constantly relying on this crude tool is Russian society\u2019s continued disassociation from its neighbors \u2014 Ukraine first and foremost.Ukrainian attitudes toward Russia have always encompassed a gamut of emotions, including an underlying resentment about a perceived sense of Russian superiority. In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russians like me thought that this would fade away, helped by continuing linguistic and cultural links and a general opening up of civil society. We were wrong. Instead, in both societies, tense historical undercurrents have taken over.\u201cThe attitude started to turn more than 10 years ago, during the elections of 2004 that became the Orange revolution,\u201d Mikhail Minakov, a Ukrainian philosopher and political scientist, wrote me in an e-mail. \u201cHatred toward Russia, originally fostered by nationalists, caught on with the rest of Ukrainian society and became, with time, the only legitimate language in addressing Moscow. Russia became a legitimate enemy.\u201dA Ukrainian friend warned me before one of my recent trips to Ukraine, \u201cThere are things you have to be cautious about,\u201d adding, \u201ctry to avoid referring to Russians and Ukrainians as being \u2018one nation\u2019 or \u2018one people\u2019 or anything close.\u201dEven those Russians who are not supporters of Mr. Putin often deny their Ukrainian neighbors a separate identity and do not recognize Ukrainian \u201cotherness.\u201dThe \u201cone people\u201d phrase has long been an irritant for many Ukrainians, in large part because Mr. Putin has used it so often. When Mr. Putin visited Kiev in 2013 to mark the 1,025th anniversary of the conversion to Christianity of the Kievan Rus \u2014 the Medieval kingdom that gave birth to both the common culture of Russia and Ukraine \u2014 he told the assembled masses: \u201cWherever Ukraine may go, we still meet again sometime and somewhere. Why? Because we are one people.\u201dThe Russian word he used, narod, was meant in Soviet and in Czarist times to represent the kinship of all the peoples and nationalities that comprised the Soviet Union and Imperial Russia. Today, the very word seems guaranteed to get under almost every patriotic Ukrainian\u2019s skin.Mr. Putin\u2019s politics of history may be working well for the Kremlin within Russia, but it puts the country on ground where no one else wants to stand. Many Russians continue to use official language rooted in the Soviet period. It is difficult for them \u2014 for us \u2014 to talk without stepping into an unfortunate turn of a phrase. We still, for example, refer to World War II as the \u201cGreat Patriotic War.\u201d But for Ukraine it was something else \u2014 something to move away from.Russia and Ukraine have diverged in the way the identities of their respective societies work. Russians identify with the state, Ukrainians identify with a civil society. Among Ukrainians today, the best way to escape a totalitarian past is by developing a society that eclipses ethnic or state identities. This is beyond the ken of most Russians, who have trouble comprehending the idea of a society comprised of many competing elements \u2014 business, labor unions, independent political parties, courts, professional and civic groups. The Russian body politic equates society with the state. Ukraine, with its growing number of volunteer movements, nongovernment charities and independent political parties, is occupied in framing a new civic identity.Whatever the linguistic ties between Russia and Ukraine, the words we share no longer have the same meaning. The vocabulary of the state is fading. If the two countries are to forge a new understanding, we must negotiate using the language of civility, one that can be spoken in any tongue \u2014 be it Russian, Ukrainian, English or German \u2014 with far less danger of our words being lost in translation.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Fires Top Aide Rick Tyler Over Misleading Video Attacking Marco Rubio", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "_____For Mr. Cruz, who has vigorously defended himself in recent weeks as rivals accused him of running an underhanded race, the episode cuts at the premise of his bid. He has cast himself as the candidate of honesty and integrity, with a faith-based pitch and a backdrop that reads \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrusTed\u00e2\u0080\u009d during speeches.On Monday, amid persistent sniping from Mr. Rubio and Donald J. Trump about the Cruz campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s penchant to mislead, the Texas senator was at last forced to acknowledge his team had gone too far.At issue was a video of a hotel lobby encounter between Mr. Rubio and a Cruz staff member who had a Bible with him. The video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtitles suggested Mr. Rubio had said there were \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot many answers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Bible. Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, Rick Tyler, posted the video on Facebook and Twitter on Sunday, needling Mr. Rubio for an \u00e2\u0080\u009cawkward remark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn fact, Mr. Rubio had said the Bible had \u00e2\u0080\u009call the answers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz said Monday that he had spent the morning investigating the episode.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters during a news conference in Las Vegas, describing his decision to request Mr. Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation.He called Mr. Tyler a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but said that his sharing of the video was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca grave error in judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if it was true, we are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if it was true, our campaign should not have sent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz took no questions about Mr. Tyler before making a hasty exit.The campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-inflicted drama came as Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, who edged past him in South Carolina, strained to emerge as the chief challenger to Mr. Trump. The two are also tussling over evangelical support, which is particularly essential to Mr. Cruz, making the dust-up over a remark about the Bible especially tense.But Mr. Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal, and Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acknowledgment of a campaign misstep, were a clear boon to Mr. Rubio on another front, creating the kind of cudgel that could prove powerful at a crucial stage of the race.It represents a public admission of what Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump have angrily asserted for weeks: that Mr. Cruz has employed deceitful tactics to undermine his rivals, including a photograph doctored by his aides that suggested Mr. Rubio was shaking hands with President Obama in front of the Capitol in Washington.After Mr. Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal, Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team moved quickly to focus attention on his boss.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRick is a really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman, Alex Conant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom, that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty. Rick did the right thing by apologizing to Marco. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high time for Ted Cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump has, less credibly, attacked Mr. Cruz on similar grounds, threatening a defamation suit over an ad reminding voters of his past support for abortion rights. He was likewise eager to seize on Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news.The mild-mannered Mr. Carson, widely admired even by non-supporters, seethed with anger, and much of the Republican field came to his defense.Days earlier, Mr. Cruz had earned a rebuke from Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary of state for mailers that accused residents of nonexistent \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoter violations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the race reached South Carolina, Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team assailed Mr. Cruz and his allies for myriad alleged mistruths. After a legal review, some television stations in South Carolina pulled an ad from a pro-Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d that had criticized Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on immigration. Mr. Cruz also faced criticism from National Right to Life for what it called \u00e2\u0080\u009cinaccurate and misleading\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarks about Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record on abortion.There have been lesser unforced errors, as when Mr. Cruz pulled one of his campaign ads after learning that an actress in it had a prior career in soft-core pornography.Mr. Cruz, once one of the most broadly popular candidates in the field, has seen his favorability ratings slip as the race has taken a sharply negative turn. A Monmouth University poll of South Carolina Republicans showed Mr. Cruz with a 45 percent favorability rating and a 39 percent unfavorable rating, a steep fall from November figures of 52 and 21.The latest episode is unlikely to help, even as Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team made clear it was moving on. Shortly after the announcement, the campaign circulated a memo arguing Mr. Cruz is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only candidate who can defeat Donald Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBob Vander Plaats, an Iowa evangelical activist and national co-chairman for Mr. Cruz, said the senator was determined to show his campaign operated at \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe highest level of integrity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d after weeks of accusations from rivals.Mr. Vander Plaats said he believed Mr. Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misstep would not have been a major controversy, if not for recent history.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt another time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not a big deal, but this time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Vander Plaats said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love Rick, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that probably had to be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter posting the video about Mr. Rubio and the Bible on Sunday morning, Mr. Tyler apologized late that night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not knowingly post a false story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote on Facebook, adding that the initial article, from the University of Pennsylvania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, had misquoted Mr. Rubio in its video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first. I regret the mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier on Monday, Mr. Rubio said he had accepted Mr. Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apology, but raised questions about the \u00e2\u0080\u009caccountability\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Cruz campaign.Mr. Tyler had been scheduled to be interviewed on MSNBC moments before Mr. Cruz began his news conference about the move, the cable network said. Mr. Tyler left abruptly just before his planned appearance, Kate Snow, the news anchor, wrote in an email to colleagues. Calls to Mr. Tyler were not returned.Though Mr. Tyler, a former top aide to Newt Gingrich, was not a longtime member of Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orbit like some other advisers, he was one of the earliest hires for the campaign and was known for his colorful quotes and aggressive attacks on rivals. He attained a level of cult status in 2011 for a creative news release in praise of Mr. Gingrich, which was later the subject of a dramatic reading by John Lithgow on \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Colbert Report.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe literati sent out their minions to do their bidding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it began, before a flourish on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillowing smoke and dust of tweets and trivia\u00e2\u0080\u009d from which Mr. Gingrich had emerged unscathed.But in this campaign, Mr. Tyler had a tendency at times to get ahead of Mr. Cruz. When Sarah Palin was expected to endorse Mr. Trump last month, Mr. Tyler said the move would damage her and her reputation as a conservative champion. Mr. Cruz later said he would not have been a senator without her help.Until now, though, Mr. Cruz had vigorously defended his team, instead accusing journalists or rival campaigns of seeking to generate controversy at his expense.On Monday, Mr. Cruz did not entirely abandon the instinct to hit back, suggesting that Mr. Rubio was seeking to deflect attention from his record.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Trump used the debate stage Thursday night to debut a new reason for why he can\u2019t do so right now, and might not even be able to release them at all during the campaign: He\u2019s been the target of curious audits for many years.\u201cBecause of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I\u2019m being audited,\u201d said Mr. Trump, adding that these audits have taken several years to conclude.\u201cFor many years, I\u2019ve been audited every year,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cTwelve years or something like that,\u201d he added, which would technically mean it stretched back to the era of President George W.

{"Headline": "Male Sellers on eBay Have an Edge Over Women, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported bySuccessful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price.Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men.The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received.\u201cThe basic point \u2014 that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating and depressing,\u201d said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.\u201cOn eBay, wow,\u201d she added, noting eBay\u2019s fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. \u201cThis would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.\u201dThe study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience.Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said.\u201cWe actually think that most of it is unconscious,\u201d said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. \u201cThe fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.\u201dBesides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest.In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a $100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alison\u2019s gift card was valued at $83.34, while Brad\u2019s was valued at $87.42.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. \u201cJust perceiving that somebody\u2019s a woman, what exactly does it mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something that\u2019s not captured in the data that they have.\u201dWithout that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that \u201cthe majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, \u2018This really isn\u2019t a 1948 Rolex\u2019 or \u2018This really isn\u2019t Jackie Robinson\u2019s signature.\u2019 \u201dThe researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBay\u2019s broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded.EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers\u2019 contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay \u201cended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.\u201dEBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. \u201cThis study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cWe are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.\u201dA few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women.Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for \u201c$100 or best offer,\u201d she was offered $50.\u201cI countered $75, and their message to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t know what this is worth because you\u2019re a girl,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells women\u2019s clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses.In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii).The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying \u201cworks great\u201d more often than \u201cnever used,\u201d for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap.Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, \u201cI did not think, \u2018Oh, eBay needs to fix this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think this is a key thing we\u2019ve got to do for gender equality.\u201dStill, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of \u201cthe importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesn\u2019t mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a study that found eBay customers tend to bid higher for items sold by men rather than women misidentified the journal that published the study. It is Science Advances, not Science.Advertisement"}

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, began his speech on Friday at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he got a standing ovation.As Mr. Cook, 55, stood before the auditorium on Apple\u2019s campus, the audience \u2014 made up mostly of investors in the company \u2014 rose from their seats and applauded him.\u201cWhere we stand in times of controversy is a measure of our character,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, an Apple shareholder who attended the meeting. \u201cSome leaders only follow opinion polls. Others stand up for their principles, refuse to compromise, and mold opinion. We have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.\u201dApple is \u201ca staunch advocate for our customers\u2019 privacy and personal safety,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWe do these things because they are the right things to do. Being hard doesn\u2019t scare us.\u201dTechnology\u2019s largest companies are now also aligning themselves with Apple. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have said they will file one or more briefs in California federal court next week in support of Apple. More could join.Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was also at the meeting, said she applauded Apple\u2019s leadership in fighting for the security and privacy of customers. She said the foundation would file a brief supporting Apple\u2019s refusal to comply with the court order.During the shareholder meeting, an energized Mr. Cook, dressed in his customary blue oxford shirt and jeans, also noted that Apple had released new versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems, which have the advanced security and encryption features that have frustrated the law enforcement agents who want access to data on Apple\u2019s devices. He said 77 percent of all active devices were using these most advanced and secure operating systems.Other social issues were also raised at the meeting. Mr. Cook said a pay study at the company had found that women earned 99.6 cents for every $1 that men did and that underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents for every $1 that white employees earned in similar roles. Mr. Cook said the company was taking measures to erase the discrepancy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Harpootlian, Sharp-Tongued South Carolina Democrat, Endorses Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "In the heat of political battle, few South Carolina Democrats have sharper tongues than Richard A. Harpootlian, a former chairman of the state party. And few have as much baggage with Bill and Hillary Clinton as Mr. Harpootlian. On Wednesday he opened fire again, endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in South Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly competitive primary contest on Feb. 27.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary is not an agent of change \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, her campaign slogan should be, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my turn,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Harpootlian, a lawyer who was state party leader from 1998 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2013. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for me to listen to how Hillary says she would fight Wall Street when she took hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not 20 years ago, but a couple years ago. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking the talk, but not walking the walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian, who supported Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaigns and then backed President Obama in 2008 and 2012, comes with a limited political network given that many prominent South Carolina Democrats have endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Harpootlian does have a knack for attracting news media coverage for his chosen candidates, and Mr. Sanders is far less known in South Carolina than Mrs. Clinton. But he also has a history of offensive statements.In 2012, as state party chairman, Mr. Harpootlian compared Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, with Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistress, Eva Braun. He also used the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cretard\u00e2\u0080\u009d to refer to other Republican leaders, and years earlier insinuated that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was gay by calling him \u00e2\u0080\u009clight in his loafers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian may be best remembered for showing up at a South Carolina campaign event in 2008 that Mr. Clinton was holding for his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. There, Mr. Harpootlian told reporters that the Clinton campaign was using \u00e2\u0080\u009creprehensible\u00e2\u0080\u009d tactics against the Obama campaign and accused the former president of lying about Mr. Obama in order to continue \u00e2\u0080\u009csome kind of Clinton dynasty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton dismissed the remark but then let loose with a torrent of criticism against the Obama campaign, Mr. Harpootlian and the news media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a public outburst that was unusual for Mr. Clinton and that cast a pall over the primary race, which Mrs. Clinton went on to lose.Mr. Harpootlian said he warned Mr. Sanders recently that his endorsement came \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith some baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He described the senator as unconcerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders said he understood that I was supposed to be a pitbull and attack dog when I was party chairman, and sometimes you get carried away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harpootlian said. He added that he did not plan to apologize for his past remarks.Mr. Sanders has been insistent that he will not run a negative campaign against Mrs. Clinton or harshly attack her. When asked about Mr. Harpootlian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of negative remarks, Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be responsible for views of people who support Senator Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment on the endorsement.The endorsement is something of a reversal for Mr. Harpootlian, who said last year that he did not see himself supporting Mr. Sanders because the senator was a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocialist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since then, Mr. Harpootlian said, he has become comfortable with Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy of democratic socialism \u00e2\u0080\u009csince it does not involve government control of the economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said he supported the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan for broad-based tax increases to finance a single-payer health care system because, according to Mr. Sanders, the tax increases would be offset by savings in health care costs.Mr. Harpootlian is a crucial South Carolina ally of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and he had been involved with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts to encourage Mr. Biden to run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Harpootlian said he asked Mr. Biden last month if he might change his mind and enter the race; the vice president said no, according to Mr. Harpootlian, prompting him to give Mr. Sanders a closer look. Mr. Harpootlian said he did not discuss the Sanders endorsement with Mr. Biden.Mrs. Clinton has a double-digit lead over Mr. Sanders in recent South Carolina polls, and she has the support of many elected and former officials, including two former governors, Jim Hodges and Richard Riley, and many mayors and others, including former Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston. She also has strong support from black Democrats in the state, a key part of the electorate that Mr. Sanders is trying to court.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Milwaukee", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you\u2019re going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you\u2019re watching \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Democrat, a Republican, or neither \u2014 because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too. With that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Very good to be here with you.CLINTON: Thank you.IFILL: Welcome to you both.WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America\u2019s heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let\u2019s turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that\u2019s an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We\u2019re spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you.IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I\u2019m running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. There aren\u2019t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women\u2019s work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.WOODRUFF: Thank you both. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we\u2019ll be right back after a short break to begin questions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let\u2019s get right to the questions. Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they\u2019re asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It\u2019s already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going \u2014 getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I\u2019ve seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans \u2014 let\u2019s take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don\u2019t add up, and that\u2019s a promise that cannot be kept, and it\u2019s really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people\u2019s lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they\u2019re going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We\u2019re not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can\u2019t even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don\u2019t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle \u2014 the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. (APPLAUSE) And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama\u2019s principal accomplishment \u2014 namely the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I\u2019ve set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it\u2019s Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if you\u2019re having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don\u2019t add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.IFILL: Final thought, Senator.SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country \u2014 the United States \u2014 which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if \u2014 and here\u2019s the if \u2014 we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.CLINTON: Well, let me just \u2014 let me just say, once again... (APPLAUSE) ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: I\u2019d like to move along. I\u2019d like to move along. Secretary Clinton, you might \u2014 you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it\u2019s health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I\u2019ve tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I\u2019m aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can\u2019t keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people\u2019s lives.IFILL: But I haven\u2019t heard either of you put a price tag on your \u2014 you say... (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I\u2019m in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.IFILL: Senator?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, I\u2019m going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession \u2014 Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don\u2019t have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it\u2019s hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders\u2019s plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Next, we\u2019re going to...SANDERS: A brief response.WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign \u2014 you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it\u2019s most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I\u2019m going to keep making that case. I\u2019m going to keep making sure that everything I\u2019ve done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working towards. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there\u2019s a special place in Hell for women who don\u2019t support other women. Do you agree with what she said?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that she\u2019s been saying that for as long as I\u2019ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn\u2019t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we\u2019re going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that\u2019s at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we\u2019ve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we\u2019ll take our progress wherever we can find it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you\u2019re in the minority, but we still want to hear from you. (LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian- Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct \u2014 I think I am \u2014 that I have a lifetime \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in Congress a few years \u2014 a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I\u2019m very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other \u2014 the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have said \u2014 I have said many times, you know, I\u2019m not asking people to support me because I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m asking people to support me because I think I\u2019m the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. (APPLAUSE) And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders\u2019 voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I\u2019ve been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women\u2019s health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.CLINTON: I\u2019m very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women\u2019s issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women\u2019s rights. So I\u2019m asking women, I\u2019m asking men, to support me because I\u2019m ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Final comment.SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women\u2019s rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We\u2019re going to cut Social Security to help you. We\u2019re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that\u2019s not hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what hypocrisy is. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you both.IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we\u2019ve been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: \u201cWisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin\u2019s incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country\u2019s rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?\u201d Senator Sanders.SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama\u2019s policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that\u2019s one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. (APPLAUSE) We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up \u2014 we\u2019re shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge I\u2019ve made throughout this campaign, and it\u2019s really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here\u2019s my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation\u2019s first African American has not been able to?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President\u2019s office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama\u2019s work with young women. But, we can\u2019t rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it\u2019s going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we\u2019re going to enforce the law, we\u2019re going to change policing practices, we\u2019re going to change incarceration practices, but we\u2019re also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.(APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African- American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration \u2014 which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother \u2014 clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.WOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they\u2019ve been?SANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they\u2019re not hanging out on street corners. We\u2019re going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids \u2014 African-American, white, Latino kids \u2014 the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They\u2019re going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?SANDERS: White people?IFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER) So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don\u2019t they have a reason to be resentful, Senator \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what\u2019s happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has \u2014 the 10-20-30 proposal \u2014 to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans \u2014 particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have \u2014 you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that\u2019s why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator \u2014 Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to \u2014 am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?SANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.SANDERS: And here\u2019s what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They\u2019re off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald\u2019s? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They\u2019re making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that\u2019s why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that\u2019s why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: The answer is yes. We\u2019ve got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn\u2019t do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I strongly support the president\u2019s executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I\u2019m against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I\u2019m a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary\u2019s position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they\u2019d be thrown out of this country. So it wasn\u2019t just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.CLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I\u2019ve also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy\u2019s bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019d like...SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don\u2019t apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I don\u2019t know to whom you\u2019re sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don\u2019t think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, that just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that just wasn\u2019t the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I\u2019ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we\u2019ve been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, \u201cMy father\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, \u201cMy father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid\u2019s family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?\u201d Start with you, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we\u2019re not doing particularly well.SANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country \u2014 who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can\u2019t get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And here\u2019s an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. (APPLAUSE) And when we \u2014 and when we do that, we don\u2019t do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don\u2019t have decent nutrition, where they can\u2019t heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I think \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don\u2019t believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.SANDERS: In all due respect... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We\u2019re asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.CLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we\u2019re in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you\u2019re describing that the \u2014 raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...SANDERS: That\u2019s my bill. Check it out.CLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I\u2019m going to come up with the best way forward. We\u2019re going to end up in the same place. We\u2019re going to get more revenue. I\u2019m going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We\u2019re going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.WOODRUFF: You have said that there\u2019s no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?CLINTON: I can\u2019t speak for the Koch Brothers, you\u2019re referring to a Super PAC that we don\u2019t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let\u2019s talk about our campaigns. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I\u2019m proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it\u2019s great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That\u2019s the way it should be, and I\u2019m going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what\u2019s happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We\u2019re going to fight it as hard as we can, and we\u2019re going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019m asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.SANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don\u2019t represent Wall Street, we don\u2019t represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I\u2019m the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until \u2014 and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton\u2019s Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I\u2019m very proud of that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...CLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I\u2019m very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It\u2019s not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can\u2019t be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930\u2019s. So, let\u2019s not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what\u2019s best for the American people.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The people aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street... (APPLAUSE) But let\u2019s not \u2014 but let\u2019s not \u2014 let\u2019s not insult \u2014 let\u2019s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. (LAUGHTER) Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay \u2014 spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? (APPLAUSE) And when we talk about Wall Street, let\u2019s talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd- Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, let\u2019s just \u2014 let\u2019s just follow up on this, because, you know, I\u2019ve made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that\u2019s a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesn\u2019t go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I\u2019ve proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that\u2019s appropriate. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...SANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That\u2019s my view. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we\u2019re going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.IFILL: There\u2019s a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.(BREAK)WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: \u201cAre there any areas of government you would like to reduce?\u201dSANDERS: Hey, I\u2019m in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn\u2019t think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.IFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we\u2019re taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don\u2019t need anymore. And that\u2019s what I intend to do.SANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you\u2019re going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America\u2019s role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can\u2019t win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?CLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it\u2019s a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven\u2019t done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS \u2014 that\u2019s not the only one, but let\u2019s focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, we\u2019ve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it\u2019s needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what\u2019s happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... (APPLAUSE) ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It\u2019s not only offensive; it\u2019s dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. (APPLAUSE) And you don\u2019t go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.IFILL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do \u2014 and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility \u2014 is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn\u2019t believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it\u2019s to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It\u2019s very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it\u2019s important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You\u2019ve got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.SANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.CLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it\u2019s important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president\u2019s decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I\u2019m proud that I gave him that advice. And I\u2019m very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...WOODRUFF: Just a final word.SANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate \u2014 and I believe in her book \u2014 very good book, by the way \u2014 in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger\u2019s actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.SANDERS: Well, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger. That\u2019s for sure.CLINTON: That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fine. (LAUGHTER) You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) So if we want to pick and choose \u2014 and I certainly do \u2014 people I listen to, people I don\u2019t listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it\u2019s a big, complicated world out there.SANDERS: It is.CLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I find \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That\u2019s what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you\u2019re right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he\u2019s urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator, let me \u2014 let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that\u2019s Russia. On the one hand, we\u2019re aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.WOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead \u2014 that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all \u2014 have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared \u2014 how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.SANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you\u2019ve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed \u2014 men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country \u2014 their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let\u2019s be clear: Russia\u2019s aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO \u2014 correctly, I believe \u2014 are saying, you know what, we\u2019re going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he\u2019s trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.SANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what\u2019s left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease- fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because we\u2019ve got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I\u2019ve disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So let\u2019s support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let\u2019s hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what\u2019s left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we\u2019ve got some real work to do, and let\u2019s try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me just \u2014 just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree \u2014 and I think the president does not agree with her \u2014 in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let\u2019s hope that it holds.SANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I\u2019m sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That\u2019s how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, they\u2019ve got to get out of Syria. They\u2019ve got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president \u2014 then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It\u2019s easier to talk to your friends. It\u2019s harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they\u2019re going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it\u2019s especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.CLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.SANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we\u2019ve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe \u2014 and, by the way, you know, we\u2019ve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide \u2014 that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we\u2019re seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He\u2019s a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, \u201cThe world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders \u2014 one American and one foreign \u2014 who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as \u2014 why are they influential?\u201dSANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That\u2019s not the role of the government. And when FDR said, \u201cYeah, it is,\u201d that we\u2019re going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don\u2019t give up on the political process. don\u2019t listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill\u2019s politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.CLINTON: But I want to \u2014 I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers\u2019 remorse when it comes to President Obama\u2019s leadership and legacy. And I just couldn\u2019t agree \u2014 disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... (APPLAUSE)The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.CLINTON: ... who got us out of that... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a \u2014 the kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.SANDERS: That is... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world\u2019s financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You\u2019re right. Maybe you haven\u2019t. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That\u2019s what I said. That is what I believe. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re- election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don\u2019t agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re- election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.IFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to \u2014 you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.SANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don\u2019t think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it\u2019s like going to the moon. It ain\u2019t going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.SANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, we \u2014 we agree that we\u2019ve got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here\u2019s the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it\u2019s poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it\u2019s the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that\u2019s what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We\u2019ve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... (APPLAUSE) ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You\u2019re right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I\u2019m going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don\u2019t think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That\u2019s coming up next here on PBS stations and online atPBS.org/NewsHour.IFILL: I\u2019m going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS.WOODRUFF: And I\u2019m going to be returning to Washington. I hope you\u2019ll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That\u2019s it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you.IFILL: Good night. (APPLAUSE)Advertisement"}

Another official pressured smartphone instant-messaging services to drop gay- and lesbian-themed emoji, prompting one company to comply.Then, the nation\u2019s broadcast regulator and its child welfare agency teamed up to urge an end to programming \u201cadvocating\u201d gay and related concerns, in part because of an ostensible rash of cross-dressing among boys.The sudden onslaught of anti-gay speech and of recommendations aimed at chipping away at the already fragile social standing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country has caught most human rights activists here by surprise.\u201cIt has been one thing after another,\u201d Dede Oetomo, a veteran gay rights activist, said Monday. \u201cAt first, I thought it was just a storm in a teacup. But the teacup is getting bigger.\u201dThat same week, Ridwan Kamil, the mayor of the country\u2019s third-largest city, Bandung, was quoted by the local news media as calling for a ban on gay and related content on social media. Shortly afterward, Islamic vigilantes attacked boardinghouses in Bandung in search of gays and lesbians.Last week, in response to pressure from the Communications Ministry, the smartphone messaging app Line agreed to remove a group of emoji for sale on its online store. The images included cartoons of cross-dressers applying makeup and of muscular men wearing skimpy towels. Another messaging app, WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, offers gay-themed emoji that are free, albeit less colorful.Finally, late last week, the National Commission for Child Protection said it fully supported a ban on gay-oriented content on the nation\u2019s airwaves. According to the local news media, a spokeswoman for the agency said transgender comedians had \u201cbrainwashed\u201d some boys to be effeminate.The administration of President Joko Widodo has so far been slow to address the hostile speech, even though homosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia.Luhut Pandjaitan, a former Suharto-era general and now a powerful senior minister as coordinator of political, legal and security affairs, said gays and lesbians deserved equal protection under the law. At the same time, he suggested they might need psychological and religious counseling.It is unclear whether the recent statements will lead to new restrictions. The spokesman for the Communications Ministry, Ismail Cawidu, did not return calls for comment on Monday.Even so, the national atmosphere regarding gay rights may be growing more highly charged. Mr. Oetomo, the veteran activist, said a party in Surabaya this month organized around encouraging attendees to be tested for H.I.V. was halted by the local police for not having the proper permits.Human rights campaigners say the situation is all the more surprising because of how modest activists\u2019 requests are relative to movements in Western countries.\u201cWhat they seek is fundamental: security and freedom of assembly,\u201d he said. \u201cSuggesting that L.G.B.T. students don\u2019t have the right to gather or that they need religious instruction or otherwise indicates a brittle understanding of diversity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the surname of a veteran gay rights activist. He is Dede Oetomo, not Oetoma.An earlier version of the above correction omitted the source of the error. It was made during the editing process, not by the reporter.Advertisement"}

The negative campaigning that marked the rest of the day was still present, however. Less than a minute into Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s segment, Mr. Cooper cited the Florida lawmaker\u2019s comments from earlier in the day and asked: Is Mr. Cruz a liar?\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you say something that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true and you say it over and over again, and you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other word for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Cruz said that he \u00e2\u0080\u009claughed out loud\u00e2\u0080\u009d at a cease-and-desist letter from Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign over an ad, and called Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insults of George W.

Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz said that they did not approve of President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announced plan to visit Cuba, saying they would not visit the country as long as the Castros are in power. Neither thought Mr. Obama should nominate a justice to replace Antonin Scalia. And they both agreed that Apple must find a way to strike a balance between private security and providing law enforcement with access to information, including breaking into the phone of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.And each often answered voters\u2019 questions with material from their stump speeches.Mr. Cruz laid out how he would protect \u00e2\u0080\u009creligious liberty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pointing, as he often does, to his record as solicitor general, and promising that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersecution for religious liberty ends today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d during a Cruz presidency.

He recalled an often-shared story of being a young child in Las Vegas and facing some childhood teasing regarding the Mariel boatlift.But he then pivoted to today, and to the coveted endorsement from  Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina he received hours before the town hall, saying this was a sign of how far the country and his Republican Party have come.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got the endorsement of a governor of Indian descent who endorsed a presidential candidate of Cuban descent, and tomorrow we will be campaigning alongside an African-American Republican senator, all here in South Carolina,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said to applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat says a lot about the Republican Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Rubio, for his part, seemed tired of the negative campaigning.

Some are wealthy, some are struggling; some are undocumented, and others are American citizens.\u201cThe community needed information,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said. \u201cWorldly information.\u201dUnlike East End publications that mostly report local stories, Voz Latina also features news from other countries.\u201cIt\u2019s about connecting the Latino community with their culture, their world,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said. \u201cWe live here, but we have our tentacles back at home. Voz Latina doesn\u2019t have one place, one community.\u201dRoger Acosta, a lawyer with a practice in Huntington Station and Riverhead, found Ms. Sepulveda\u2019s passion so inspiring that he wrote the check for Voz Latina\u2019s first ad.\u201cNewspapers are what create our freedom,\u201d said Mr. Acosta, who lived in Cuba until he was 9. He said he remembers his parents lamenting the lack of freedom of the press.Ms. Sepulveda said she believed being informed was critical to being empowered. As a co-founder of Organizaci\u00f3n Latino-Americana, she has striven to strengthen the Latino community on the East End through workshops, celebrations and advocacy. In Voz Latina, she informs readers about local leaders who are sympathetic to the Latino experience, which means that the publication admittedly has political leanings.\u201cI put things in there so people know who represents them,\u201d she said.Columns in Voz Latina offer advice on immigration issues, as well as problems out of the public eye such as domestic violence and alcoholism.\u201cAfter September the economy really slows,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said, \u201cand people get stressed there\u2019s not enough money to pay the bills. There\u2019s insecurity, and machismo, which can lead to these issues.\u201dMs. Sepulveda said she felt that her mission was to connect the Anglo and Latino worlds on the East End, and she is consciously looking for places where they overlap, like the dance floor.\u201cThere are people who won\u2019t even walk down Main Street because they\u2019re afraid the police will stop them. But when Mambo Loco plays,\u201d she said, referring to a popular local band that specializes in Afro-Cuban and Puerto Rican music, \u201cyou see everyone on the dance floor. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a citizen or if you\u2019re undocumented.\u201dMs. Sepulveda said she hoped that Voz Latina, like music, could create a space for communication. She said she often received phone calls and messages on Facebook from readers who needed help and wanted to connect.\u201cSomeone called me up and told me immigration took her son,\u201d she said. Ms. Sepulveda included the story in the paper, along with an article in Spanish that explained what to do if immigration agents came to the door.\u201cPeople need to know their rights,\u201d she said.Angela Quintero, who taught business administration in her native Colombia before moving to East Hampton, writes a column that addresses topics like effective communication and leadership. These are important and often-overlooked skills for people coming to the United States, she said.\u201cMost immigrants come here looking to achieve their dreams,\u201d Ms. Quintero said. \u201cBut they arrive at this totally different culture, and often they have to change their focus.\u201dMs. Quintero hopes that instead of surrendering their dreams, her readers will learn how to take an idea that she writes about, combine it with their own aspirations, and create a business plan.Voz Latina is bilingual: Ms. Sepulveda said she wanted Anglo readers to pick it up to connect to the Latino community, as well as the other way around. Some columnists, like Javier P\u00e9rez Mandujano, a life coach from Mexico by way of France, write in both languages.He said that he wrote in both languages because a column could not simply be translated into another language, because of cultural nuances and sensibilities.\u201cSometimes we try so hard to define our culture, we end up confronting,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez Mandujano. He said that, while it is important to maintain cultural identity, it is also important to connect. \u201cVoz Latina,\u201d he said, \u201cis a bridge.\u201dWhether the Latino community has been integrated into East End culture remains a controversial subject.

Ms. Quintero is a member of the committee, charged with community outreach. Larry Cantwell, East Hampton town supervisor, said he hoped the Town Board would introduce and facilitate new bilingual workshops with the police and housing departments.\u201cThis population is a significant part of the community, and we want to break down the communication barrier,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said.Ms. Quintero attributed the strides being made in communication between Latinos and the broader East End community, in large part, to the efforts of Voz Latina.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about language, it\u2019s about culture, it\u2019s about communication,\u201d she said. \u201cVoz Latina connects the community by opening doors into different cultures.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump coverage. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only fitting that the final days of the Republican primary in South Carolina and the Democratic caucuses in Nevada will play out in televised town-hall-style meetings. In a game of television brinkmanship, CNN will host the first of two town-hall-style meetings in South Carolina with Republican presidential candidates, with three at each, held on successive nights. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson will appear Wednesday night, while Mr. Trump will appear on Thursday night, along with Jeb Bush and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. But MSNBC will also host a Democratic candidate forum in Nevada with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton on Thursday. And on Wednesday night, the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski will hold a forum solely with Mr. Trump. For voters who have reveled in the extensive television coverage, their cups will run over. But the ratings rivalry on Wednesday will be closely watched. The opportunities for candidates to call attention to their positions have been welcomed in these town-hall-style events. And the hopefuls don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage with one another.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "On May 17, 1957, nearly 25,000 demonstrators gathered at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington to commemorate the third anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark United States Supreme Court ruling that struck down state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students.Organized by the civil right activists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin and others, the nonviolent Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom endeavored not only to celebrate the gains made in light of that decision, but also to publicize the failure of many Southern states to follow through on the court-ordered desegregation of public schools, among other antidiscrimination practices. The three-hour event featured speeches, prayers, songs and the recitation of scripture by such prominent Americans as the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, the activist Roy Wilkins, the educator and pastor Mordecai Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the Founding Americans prayed for strength and wisdom in the wilderness of a new land, as the slaves and their descendants prayed for emancipation and human dignity, as men of every color and clime in time of crisis have sought Divine guidance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Mr. Randolph, Dr. King and Mr. Wilkins in their call for a pilgrimage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso now in these troubled and momentous years, call upon all who love justice, and dignity, liberty \u2026 to join in a Prayer Pilgrimage to Washington \u2026 where we shall renew our strength, communicate our unity, and rededicate our efforts, firmly but peaceably, to the attainment of freedom.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough the gathering failed to reach its goal of 50,000 attendees, it was the largest organized demonstration for civil rights to that time. Although modest in comparison with the 1963 March on Washington, which attracted about 250,000 people, it would prove to be historically significant, laying the groundwork for future demonstrations. Significantly, it was also where Dr. King delivered his \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive Us the Ballot\u00e2\u0080\u009d speech, in which he implored the president and members of Congress to ensure voting rights for African-Americans, a speech that helped establish him as the pre-eminent leader of the civil rights movement.As the eye glides across Mr. Friedlander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syncopated photographs, it observes not only the totality and grandeur of the demonstration, but also the individual participants as well as their shared actions and unified activities: masses of people, sitting on folding chairs, standing or marching, their faces a study in solemnity and determination; the elegantly dressed father who hugs his young son protectively as they listen to a speech; groups of demonstrators huddled in conversation; a woman, exhausted after hours of demonstrating, reclining on the grass; thousands of hands raised in solidarity; Mr. Johnson, at the podium, delivering a fiery speech; and the unassuming presence of famous entertainers and activists, including the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis Jr., Ruby Dee and Rosa Parks.Despite the fame of some demonstrators, the mood of the event \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and its representation by Mr. Friedlander \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was egalitarian. Thus, the power of these images resides not only in their sweeping cinematic quality, but also in their ability to capture the intimacy, dignity and individually of their subjects without minimizing the magnitude of a significant historical event. And like all effective long shots, whether literal or, in this case, suggested, the totality of the big picture invariably gives way to its telling details.Mr. Friedlander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to detail underscores one of the central objectives of the pilgrimage: to highlight the individuality and humanity of its participants and their endurance, voice and visibility in an unjust society. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the words of Abraham Lincoln,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the call for the pilgrimage reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a nation \u00e2\u0080\u0098conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 We believe its people treasure the heritage of equality before the law. They uphold this principle because they know that every man, whatever his race, religion or station, must be free if our nation is to remain strong.\u00e2\u0080\u009dUltimately, rather than seeming anachronistic, the photographs of the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom prefigure the psychological depth, humanity, visual sophistication and critical distance that later came to characterize Mr. Friedlander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better-known street photographs, urban landscapes and portraits. As he famously said of his process: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt fascinates me that there is a variety of feeling about what I do. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a premeditative photographer. I see a picture and I make it. If I had a chance, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be out shooting all the time. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go looking for pictures. The material is generous. You go out and the pictures are staring at you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe lesson to be learned from \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrayer Pilgrimage for Freedom\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that in the process of photographing and being photographed, generosity can go both ways. By this standard, Mr. Friedlander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prodigious and graceful images are eminently generous to their subjects, representing them in their full humanity and self-possession, in a world too often committed to their silence and invisibility.Maurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

Despite the audience\u2019s knowledge that the former football star Orenthal James Simpson will be found not guilty (history is not a spoiler, sorry), the series is absorbing, infuriating and, yes, thoroughly entertaining.And despite the program\u2019s well-chewed-over subject matter \u2014 the Bronco! the glove! Kato Kaelin! \u2014 it is revelatory, though not about the murders. You probably have an opinion as to whether O. J. did it. \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d is not interested in sharing its own, though the book it\u2019s based on, \u201cThe Run of His Life: The People v. O. J. Simpson,\u201d by Jeffrey Toobin, couldn\u2019t be more explicit: \u201cSimpson murdered his ex-wife and her friend.\u201d (The author was a consultant on the series.)Go back through the key points and main players of the trial.Mr. Gooding captures the unsettling enigma of Mr. Simpson, the running back, actor and Hertz pitchman, grown strange in the hothouse of celebrity, lashing out \u2014 in grief? guilt? \u2014 as the investigation closes in on him. Before the infamous freeway chase, he signs a suicide note, \u201cPeace and Love, O. J.,\u201d with a smiley face in the \u201cO.\u201dThe show really comes to life when we meet Johnnie Cochran (a magnetic Courtney B. Vance), a legal maestro who can hear the note of race in the investigation while everyone else is still deaf to it. Mr. Simpson may protest to his defense team that \u201cI\u2019m not black, I\u2019m O. J.!\u201d But when the prosecutor Christopher Darden (Sterling K. Brown) argues to an African-American neighbor that Mr. Simpson effectively \u201cbecame white\u201d as a celebrity, his neighbor answers: \u201cWell, he got the cops chasing him. He\u2019s black now.\u201dBut he\u2019s still famous, and rich enough to assemble his fractious dream team of defenders, including Mr. Cochran, Robert Shapiro (imagined by John Travolta as a vain wax doll), F. Lee Bailey (Nathan Lane) and Alan Dershowitz (Evan Handler), aided by Mr. Simpson\u2019s pal Robert Kardashian (David Schwimmer).Against this well-financed club, its meetings catered with lox and whitefish from Nate\u2019n Al of Beverly Hills, is the overtaxed yet overconfident prosecutor Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson), certain that once a jury sees the evidence and O. J.\u2019s history of domestic violence, neither race nor celebrity will matter. She\u2019s driven, idealistic, blinded, doomed.Docufiction may seem an odd fit for Mr. Murphy, known for carving the exquisite gargoyles of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cScream Queens.\u201d But Mr. Murphy, a former journalist, has a reporter\u2019s impulse to document the way we live and a moralist\u2019s zeal about society\u2019s obsession with fame and appearance. (His \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d used plastic surgery to examine self-loathing; \u201cGlee\u201d began with Rachel Berry\u2019s declaration that \u201cbeing anonymous is worse than being poor.\u201d)Like an amateur sleuth arguing that a guilty man was framed, this series believes that two seemingly opposed ideas can be true: a charge of police racism, say, can be both legitimate and cynically deployed. Its triumph is to take a case that divided the nation into teams and treat everyone, vulture or victim, with curiosity and empathy.Ms. Clark, for instance, has been lambasted for her failings \u2014 Tina Fey played her as a bumbler in \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d Ms. Paulson makes her a flawed but tragic heroine: a divorced mom, strapped for child care, battling a legal hydra made of money while the tabloids pick at her hairstyle and kibitzers tell her to smile more. Among other things, the series is a story of a feminist narrative \u2014 domestic abuse, stereotypes of women \u2014 losing to a racial one. (If the trial happened today, there would be a smoking ash heap where Twitter and Facebook used to be.)The casting is inspired, from Connie Britton as Faye Resnick (Ms. Simpson\u2019s friend turned instant tell-all author) to Larry King as himself. Robert Morse is delectable as the journalist-gadfly Dominick Dunne, who dismisses the notion that the police framed Mr. Simpson. \u201cO. J. hosted pool parties for them,\u201d he scoffs, dragging out \u201cpooool\u201d into a little catty aria.The oddest choice is how the series strains to include Mr. Kardashian\u2019s young children \u2014 notably \u201cKimmy\u201d \u2014 who now live on reality-TV Olympus. Having used his new fame to jump a line and score a table at brunch, he tells his kids: \u201cWe are Kardashians. And in this family, being a good person and a loyal friend is more important than being famous.\u201dThe line is on the nose enough to leave a mark, but it feels like more than mere name-dropping. The trial is long over, \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d tells us, but the world is still dining out on this sad story.Advertisement"}

Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who dropped out of the race at the end of the night, and ahead of only Rick Santorum and Jim Gilmore.Those results make New Hampshire, with its primary next Tuesday, essentially a make-or-break state for Mr. Christie, a point that was visible as he embarked on a schedule on Tuesday of five public events, from Nashua to Bedford to Manchester.As he spoke to the Salvation Army, he noted that it was his 67th day in New Hampshire \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which he said was more than any other candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and he called it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe emphasis of our campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, he offered his opinion of the Iowa results, saying he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot very surprised\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the pecking order of Ted Cruz-Donald Trump-Marco Rubio.Mr. Christie said Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, needed to win Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and did.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "People see sharks as predators, not prey. Admit it, even in 2016, you can still hum the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJaws\u00e2\u0080\u009d theme in your head. Yet according to the Italian photographer Federico Vespignani, the global shark population has plummeted 80 percent because of overfishing.Mr. Vespignani, 27, grew up in Venice, a city of water, but his natural rebellious streak drew him to land. He became interested in graffiti, and skateboarding, which is apparently outlawed in the tourist mecca.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Venice, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illegal to have wheels in the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can walk only by foot. If the police catch you skating, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bring your skateboard with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe used a little pocket camera to document the tricks his friends tried and the tags they sprayed. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get serious about photography until his grandfather, a Communist writer, gave him a copy of a Robert Capa photography book, hoping to inspire a new level of seriousness. The gambit worked, and Mr. Vespignani went on to study art in Rome, before embarking on his career as a professional photographer in Milan.He became interested in shark fishing after hearing about the precipitous decline in shark populations. He read about a group of shark fishermen in Baja who were trying to take tourists out to swim with the sharks, and was intrigued by the contradiction. Like most people, he was also very afraid of sharks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always had a big fascination for sharks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey scare me a lot. I also like the relationship that can be between the man and the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe self-funded a trip to the Baja California peninsula in 2015, to better understand the intricate realities behind shark fishing. He had arranged to meet up with representatives from Pelagic Life, a Mexico City-based nongovernmental organization, curious about its attempt to build a tourist market for swimming with sharks. (The effort is apparently not succeeding, as the fishermen are skeptical of conservationist efforts.)When the Pelagic Life representatives were delayed, Mr. Vespignani found himself alone in the village of Puerto San Carlos and tried to persuade the members of the fishing community to drop their guard and let him photograph their work. They were particularly suspicious, believing he might be a government agent, as there had been reports that Mexico had considered banning shark fishing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI started talking with all of the people in the village, which is very small,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were more confident when the days passed. I also ate with them. My ticket for entering the island was 25 Tecate lights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Vespignani was invited to visit the shark fishermen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camp on Cabo San Lazaro, a small island off the Pacific Coast, two hours away by boat. When he arrived, he discovered the spartan conditions in which the fishermen lived while they were away from their permanent home village, El Sargento.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn this island, there is absolutely nothing. Just coyotes and vultures,\u201d he said. \u201cNo electricity. No water. Just a couple of barracks, and seven crews of fishermen. Two guys per boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf his goal was to confront his fears and chase danger, the little Mexican island obliged, as he faced poisonous black widow spiders and a hungry pack of coyotes before he even got into the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very dangerous job, because you are fishing shark up to 30 miles from the coast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are in the open ocean. Everything can go wrong. Moreover, that kind of boat is very small. Only six meters. They have just one alarm system that is a kind of GPS, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Vespignani shot for eight days alongside the fishermen, sometimes in 12-foot waves. He even helped haul sharks into the boat after one of the crew was injured. He learned that the fishermen do it for love and camaraderie, but mostly for a lack of choice, as the sharks were overfished in the calmer Sea of Cortes, where El Sargento is.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf these fishermen can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fish shark, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDown there in Baja California, there are really no jobs. All you have to do is fishing, or maybe you have to become a narco.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough he risked much to get his photographs, Mr. Vespignani doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really believe that photography can change things by itself. He wants to use his work to create dialogue and draw attention to the messy reality of environmental concerns.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNowadays, the fish in the sea are disappearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor some people right now, there are no alternatives, so they are continuing to fish, because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to get economical benefits from other resources.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat said, he did report that shark fins, long coveted in parts of Asia, were now less expensive, the trade no longer flourishing, because of the results of conservation and criminalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not against the fishermen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want to raise some questions about this relationship. The conservationist approach is a kind of aristocratic idea, when the reality is different, and a lot more complicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Hopes to Follow Hillary Clinton\u2019s Lead in Nevada", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "The shock and awe of a New York real estate developer-turned-reality television star\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winning the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday night blotted out the other major, parallel story of Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory in the Nevada caucuses. Mrs. Clinton, depending on how delegates are allocated in Clark County, will end up with more pledged delegates from the caucuses than Senator Bernie Sanders. That would give her a lead not just in pledged delegates, which are won in states, but in superdelegates as well. A lead in both categories eluded her in the 2008 race against Barack Obama, and, if it holds through Super Tuesday and beyond, it would render moot some of the complaints against her from progressive groups. And the results in Nevada, just as the final numbers in Iowa did, vindicated for many in the Clinton orbit the approach and style of Robby Mook, her campaign manager, who faced a barrage of questions heading into those contests.As for the Republicans, it is their turn to head to Nevada, where Donald J. Trump owns a hotel and has a commanding lead. Caucuses did not favor Mr. Trump in Iowa, where organization mattered a great deal and where his campaign was not well prepared. Nevada, as well as the Super Tuesday states, will be another big test of his ability to organize. But despite some signs of weakness that showed in South Carolina in his base of support, Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump are increasingly fearful that, with a divided field of candidates heading into the Super Tuesday states, he is strong enough to emerge successful. The only person who might be able to stop Mr. Trump is Mr. Trump, by virtue of an eruption or provocation so far unforeseen. Mr. Trump seemed to try hard, almost inadvertently, to damage himself, particularly in the final week before South Carolina voted.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Donors Hear Concerns About Nevada Outcome", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, sat at the head of a conference table in the New York office of Clinton donor and Wall Street investor Marc Lasry, according to accounts from people in the room. Joining them for the state-of-the-race conversation over coffee were members of the campaign\u2019s finance steering committee, including Maureen White, the former Democratic National Committee finance chairwoman, Alan Patricof, Michael Kempner, Robert Zimmerman, Betsy Cohen, Jay Snyder and others.Mr. Mook told the donors that the outcome in Nevada, a state he ran for Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 campaign, was hard to predict and that, depending on turnout, Mrs. Clinton could win by a lot or win or lose by a tiny margin, according to several donors who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting. But Mr. Mook stressed that the map leaned in Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor as the race moved to South Carolina, where he was confident she would win, and that she would do well on March 1, when more states voted. The collected fundraisers, who for years have bundled checks for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, listened approvingly as Ms. White, who seemed especially frustrated, expressed bewilderment that the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mobilization of grassroots support had been eclipsed in the news media by Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of Mrs. Clinton as the establishment candidate representing big money. Donors also voiced some frustration with the lack of media scrutiny of Mr. Sanders, who they said was essentially getting a pass. They pressed Mr. Mook to demonstrate that the Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy proposals were entirely implausible promises and that his responses to essentially all substantive questions drew on excerpts of his stump speech and rants about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillionaires and billionaires.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne donor also asked Mr. Mook to go after the youth vote.

Haley, had just endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a visibly frustrated Mr. Bush took the stage at a country club here for his usual campaign speech.But when he was finished, an usual thing happened: Instead of the typical questions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about the rising cost of college tuition, say, or the growing national debt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 voter after voter stood to give Mr. Bush suggestions on how to better run his campaign.Edward Scott, 58, who lives in Maryland but works in South Carolina, noted Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201ccivility\u201d and asked if he \u201ccould raise the bar\u201d in the next debate and \u201ctry to be beyond the bullying,\u201d adding that Mr. Bush seemed to have been \u201cknocked off center\u201d by his rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m shaken up by the bully,\u201d said Mr. Bush, trying to defend his handling of Donald J. Trump\u2019s unruly influence on the Republican primary race. \u201cIn fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the only guy going after the guy because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hijacking the party.\u201dAnother man, David Villinger, 62, of Ridgeville, S.C., said he couldn\u2019t help but agree with Mr. Scott\u2019s analysis. Mr. Villinger said he had heard \u201cnothing but good things\u201d about Mr. Bush, but worried, as he told the former Florida governor, that \u201cthe campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time.\u201d\u201cI think he is getting you off your message, your good message,\u201d he continued, urging Mr. Bush to emphasize his positive policies. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d Mr. Bush said, sounding slightly exasperated. \u201cThis is called campaigning right now.\u201d After the event, Mr. Villinger told reporters, \u201cHe may be doing it, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not seeing it.\u201d But, he added, he had arrived at the country club torn between supporting Mr. Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, and left \u201cmuch more in Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camp.\u201dA third man, meanwhile, had stood to say that he loved Mr. Bush\u2019s brother, former President George W. Bush, but wondered if Mr. Bush had the mettle to be a sufficiently tough candidate, using a more crude term.\u201cWill I be an S.O.B., I think he said?\u201d Mr. Bush said, turning to the crowd. \u201cI will be tough, I will be resolute, I will be firm, I will be clear, I will be determined.\u201dSpeaking shortly after Mr. Rubio secured Ms. Haley\u2019s support, Mr. Bush was even harsher: \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for me to be lectured to by a gifted young guy who thinks that going to a committee hearing means that you know something about the world,\u201d he said. After the event, Mr. Scott, who works in commercial real estate, lamented that the 2016 presidential race was \u201clike watching a Jerry Springer show.\u201dMr. Bush\u2019s narrative, he added, \u201cjust doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play like that in a national forum, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too bad because he is the most qualified and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a great story.\u201dMr. Bush, for his part, seemed unready to be written off just yet.\u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all been decided, apparently,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThe pundits have made it all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all decided.

{"Headline": "Google Will Further Block Some European Search Results", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byIn its continuing game of hide-and-seek with European privacy regulators, Google is about to make more changes to how people view its search results in Europe.The companyt will soon block access to certain disputed links from all of its domains \u2014 including the main United States one, Google.com \u2014 when people in Europe use its online search engine, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The move is the latest attempt by Google to comply with a May 2014 data privacy ruling by Europe\u2019s highest court, while also trying to minimize damage to the company\u2019s vast global database of digital information. That ruling, known as the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and hailed by many national data privacy officials in Europe, forced Google to comply with the region\u2019s tough privacy rules, even when those laws were at odds with the company\u2019s goal of providing unfettered information to people worldwide.\u201cThere\u2019s a cultural gap between Europe and the United States,\u201d said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of Linklaters, a law firm. \u201cIn Europe, we have a very strong position that views privacy as a fundamental right.\u201dUntil now, Google has complied with the European court\u2019s decision to remove links to online material at the request of European residents, though it has balked at extending those privacy rights to its global domains like Google.com that would encompass its non-European users.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Now, Google will go further, in part to forestall legal disputes and potential fines from European national privacy agencies. The search giant has told Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities that it will start blocking certain links on all of its global domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 when they are viewed from the European Union country where the original claim was made.As part of the change, which will take effect by March, when someone succeeds in asking Google to remove or block access to a link for legitimate privacy reasons, the company will remove the link from its European domains \u2014 like Google.es in Spain, for example \u2014 and block access to the link from all of its global sites that can be used from the country where the request was submitted.In practice, that would mean a successful request from someone in Spain would lead to the removal of the link from all of Google\u2019s European online search domains, while blocking access to it from all of its non-European domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 from that specific country.Search results for individuals outside the European Union, including the United States, will not be affected, and links on Google\u2019s non-European domains will still be accessible from other European countries, according to the people with knowledge of h Google\u2019s plans.The company has continually stressed that the European court ruling should apply only within the 28-member bloc. Google argues that if it agreed to alter all of its global search requests on behalf of the Europeans, other countries like China and Russia may soon demand that Google change its practices to meet their own national laws.Google has fallen afoul of Europe\u2019s privacy rules before, particularly in privacy-sensitive Germany. But several other United States tech companies have also found themselves embroiled in complicated legal disputes over how they collect, monitor and use the data from the likes of people\u2019s social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases, which are fast becoming digital currency for companies\u2019 lucrative advertising operations.Yet it is Google that has often become the target of Europe\u2019s privacy concerns. That is partly because the company\u2019s activities stretch across people\u2019s daily digital activities through Google\u2019s dominant search engine, its ever-present mobile phone software known as Android and the company\u2019s other online services.Despite Google\u2019s renewed efforts to appease European privacy concerns, it remains unclear whether the company\u2019s actions will be enough to head off the continuing legal challenges by Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities.Elsa Trochet-Mac\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the French privacy authority that has already fined Google for previous privacy infractions, said on Thursday that the company informed Europe\u2019s data protection regulators last month about the coming changes to its search results, but that the French agency had not yet decided whether they meant that Google now complied with Europe\u2019s privacy rules.\u201cWe\u2019re now analyzing the new changes,\u201d Ms. Trochet-Mac\u00e9 said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. to Further Scour Social Media Use of Visa and Asylum Seekers", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byPosts on Twitter, Facebook and other social media can reveal a wealth of information that can be used to identify potential terrorists, but experts say the department faces an array of technical, logistical and language barriers in trying to analyze the millions of records generated every day.Travel industry officials and immigration rights advocates say the new policy carries the peril of making someone who posts legitimate criticism of American foreign policy or who has friends or followers who express sympathy toward terrorists subject to unwarranted scrutiny.Their concerns underline the mounting challenge for law enforcement agencies that are trying to keep pace with the speed and scope of technology as terrorists turn to social media as an essential tool.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the policy, but it is a concern considering the already lengthy and opaque process that refugees have to go through,\u201d said Melanie Nezer of HIAS, a group that helps resettle refugees in the United States. \u201cIt could keep out people who are not a threat.\u201d Several trade organizations in the travel industry said they had similar concerns.Since the shooting, counterterrorism officials and lawmakers have grown increasingly worried about the use of social media by terrorist groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.In Congress, several bills, including one by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have been introduced that would require the Department of Homeland Security to screen the social media use of refugees and those visiting or migrating to the United States.Mr. McCain\u2019s bill, along with a similar measure introduced by Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, would require the department to examine all public records, including \u201cInternet sites and social media profiles,\u201d to determine whether an applicant would be a security risk.\u201cThis legislation adds an important and necessary layer of screening that will go a long way in properly vetting the online activities of those wishing to enter the United States,\u201d said Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cA simple check of social media accounts of foreign travelers and visa applicants,\u201d he added, \u201cwill help ensure that those who have participated in, pledged allegiance to or communicated with terrorist organizations cannot enter the United States.\u201dCongress has yet to act on the legislation, but Democrats have also called for more screening of social media accounts. In December, 22 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, urging him to have the agency immediately begin reviewing applicants\u2019 social media accounts.The department said that it had developed a list of nearly three dozen situations where social media can be examined to screen applicants, but that it did not consistently examine accounts for signs of support or participation in terrorist organizations.Last year, the department established a task force to study the issue and to make recommendations to Mr. Johnson on ways to incorporate the screening of social media accounts into the vetting process. A new social media policy is expected soon; agency officials did not give a timetable.The agency does not have the ability to reach private communications sent via direct messaging.\u201cAll we have is the ability to access the public-facing statements that individuals make,\u201d Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, the agency\u2019s director, said at the congressional hearing, on Feb. 3. \u201cWe do not have a way to reach private communications.\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez said that while some social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were scanned with software, most screening was done manually by analysts at the agency.\u201cIt\u2019s slow going and, short term, is just for Syrians,\u201d he said.In the future, the Department of Homeland Security hopes to find a way to fully automate the process of going through a huge amount of messages and other data, he said. It said it would bring in experts from the technology industry at the end of the month to talk about the tools available to search social media.The agency said it would also have to hire and train additional people, including more linguists, to screen the accounts.But experts say that analyzing the social media accounts of tens of millions of people who entered the country each year to work, visit and live would be exceedingly difficult.Users might have multiple accounts on different platforms, the accounts can be in different languages, and many people use aliases.John Elder, a data-mining expert based in Charlottesville, Va., who has worked with the Internal Revenue Service and the Postal Service on fraud detection, said it was possible to build models to scan thousands of social media postings for information that could help identify potential terrorists.\u201cBut hopefully, people won\u2019t have the expectation that it will be an infallible oracle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will help you pinpoint things you need to check further, but it\u2019s not error free.\u201dDavid Heyman, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security for policy, agrees. \u201cYou have to be careful how you design the proposal to screen people,\u201d he said. \u201cArtificial intelligence and algorithms have a poor ability to discern sarcasm or parody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But there was even more vitriol among candidates at the Republican debate last week in South Carolina that Jim Wilson photographed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis time around, the candidates are much more hostile towards each other than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Wilson, whose campaign coverage began with Jimmy Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful presidential race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that at the end of the process they\u2019ll be feeling much love for each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt reminded Mr. Heisler of \u00e2\u0080\u009chow intensely personal the political process is for everyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It also pointed to how photos are consumed in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaigns.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2004, there was no social media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Heisler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have moved on to the next city long before anyone would see my work. Now people are seeing images on our site before the event is even over sometimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Iowa this year, Doug Mills quickly learned that \u00e2\u0080\u009chandshakes are out and selfie photos are in\u00e2\u0080\u009d while covering Hillary Clinton. While Mr. Mills has photographed her shaking hands and signing autographs after campaign speeches for over two decades, this year he watched as the former secretary of state spent up to an hour taking selfies with her supporters.The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographers noted that there seemed to be fewer private house parties and small events in both Iowa and New Hampshire this year and a greater reliance on large events with intense security. An exception was a John Kasich event that was so informal that afterward, Richard Perry photographed Mr. Kasich having a snowball fight with reporters.At the more typical campaign event, Mr. Perry looks for little moments, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe views, insights and smells that you might suck in if you were there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But this year they are harder to come by. All the photographers noted that there was substantially less access than in previous election cycles.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are expected to cover campaign events from inside an overcrowded, barricaded area at the back of the events and every once in a while are allowed close to the stage for one to two minutes at a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Winter, who covered Donald J. Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are herded like cattle back and forth from cage to cage by the campaign staff. Any press photographers that are found roaming freely around events \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I like to think of them as healthier, free-range photographers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are escorted back to the cage or off the premises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaking images different from what the campaigns want is at the core of covering politics for Stephen Crowley, who has been shooting campaign events since 1979.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI strive to move beyond the restrictions and the spin to present the substance of the issues and consequences of contemporary American politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said."}
{"Headline": "Turning Your Pet Into a Therapy Dog", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.It did not take long for me to recognize the therapeutic potential of Max, the hypoallergenic 5-month-old Havanese puppy I adopted in March 2014. He neither barked nor growled and seemed to like everyone, especially the many children that come up and down our block. When I asked if a crying child passing by would like to pet a puppy, the tears nearly always stopped as fluffy little Max approached, ready to be caressed. So I signed us up for therapy dog training with the Good Dog Foundation, which met conveniently in my neighborhood. If we passed the six-week course, we would be certified to visit patients in hospitals and nursing homes, children in schools, and people in other venues that recognize the therapeutic potential of well-behaved animals.Training involves a joint effort of dog and owner, usually in groups of four to eight pairs. The dog can be any size, any breed, but must be housebroken; nonaggressive; not fearful of strangers, loud or strange noises, wheelchairs or elevators, and able to learn basic commands like sit, lie down and leave it. Good temperament is critical; a dog that barks incessantly, nips or jumps on people uninvited would hardly be therapeutic.During our first visit to patients at my local hospital, a woman who said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had a \u00e2\u0080\u009cterrible morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d invited Max onto her bed, showered him with affection and, crying with pleasure, thanked me profusely for bringing him around to cheer her up. Moments later, on the pediatrics ward, a preverbal toddler hospitalized with croup spotted Max and came charging down the hall squealing with delight. The two met eye-to-eye; Max even appeared to smile, and she giggled as she patted his head.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about Max, but I was hooked. I agreed to bring him for monthly patient visits, with a promise to do more if my schedule permitted, and I was able to do the required pre-visit bath.A therapy dog need not be small and fluffy. A neighbor with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmush\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a 90-pound American pit bull named Pootie has had similar experiences at the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System\u2019s Brooklyn campus.  During the first visit, one patient told him repeatedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou made my day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut while a hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voluntary pet therapy program is designed to aid patients, in my experience the chronically stressed hospital staff benefits as much if not more from pet visits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I pick him up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the typical request from hospital personnel I encounter, and some don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even wait for me to say yes.   Therapy pets differ from service animals like those that guide the blind, detect impending health crises for people with epilepsy or diabetes, or stimulate learning for children with autism or cerebral palsy. Pet therapy most often involves privately owned animals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually dogs, but also cats, rabbits, even kangaroos, birds, fish and reptiles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that their owners take to facilities to enhance the well-being of temporary or permanent residents. Thus, in addition to relieving the monotony of a hospital stay or entertaining residents in a nursing home, Max might visit a school where young children wary of reading aloud will happily read to a dog that does not care about mistakes.At my local hospital, therapy dogs often attend group sessions for psychiatry patients. Cynthia Chandler, a counseling professor at the University of North Texas and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnimal Assisted Therapy in Counseling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reports that visits by her dog Bailey increased patient participation in group therapy and improved hygiene and self-care among those with severe mental illness. Valerie Abel, a psychologist who coordinates the pet therapy program at the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs hospital, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe presence of therapy dogs makes such a difference. Many ask when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll next be back. A big dog can put its head on patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beds and you can actually see them relax.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn elderly patients with dementia, depression declines after they interact with a therapy animal.  And researchers at the University of Southern Maine showed that therapy dog visits can calm agitation in patients with severe dementia.Therapy dogs are often described as better than any medicine. They know instinctively when someone needs loving attention. Last winter, when I was felled by the flu (despite my annual shot), 1-year-old Max lay at the foot of my bed for hours on end, making none of his usual demands for attention and play.In a related program, veterans back from service in Iraq and Afghanistan are giving basic obedience training to shelter dogs, a project that helps the vets readjust to being home and offers the dogs a chance to gain a home of their own.Before signing up for therapy dog training, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be wise to find out first what the program involves and its cost and what will be required of you by the facilities you hope to visit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to provide annual documentation of Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccinations and freedom from intestinal parasites, which typically requires a visit to the vet. I too had to show I was immune to multiple infectious diseases and free of H.I.V., and the hospital had to test me for drug abuse.Still, the rewards Max and I have accrued as hospital volunteers more than compensate for these requirements.

{"Headline": "Latinos in Nevada Cheer Hillary Clinton\u2019s Responses on Immigration", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonky immersion in policy details paid off for her when immigration came up on Thursday night during the MSNBC and Telemundo town-hall-style event in Las Vegas for the Democratic presidential contenders. The audience was diverse, reflecting the population of Nevada, with many Latinos and immigrants whose faces have rarely been seen in earlier televised town halls. At one point, a woman from the audience told Senator Bernie Sanders, when he was onstage, that she was an American citizen, but her Mexican husband of many years had been deported and prohibited from returning to the United States for 10 years. She was referring to provisions in a 1996 law that bar immigrants who have been in the country illegally from returning after they are deported or leave voluntarily, for at least three years and in most cases for 10 years. Mr. Sanders responded vaguely, saying that his policies would avoid separating families.Later, when it was her turn in front of the audience, Mrs. Clinton went back to the question, clearly familiar with the legal bars, saying she would repeal them. When pressed by a moderator, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 D\u00c3\u00adaz-Balart of Telemundo, Mrs. Clinton said she would send two different bills to Congress to make sure the bars were canceled. A point of law, which would probably be obscure to most Americans, had painful meaning for immigrants at this forum who had seen family members deported, and they cheered her response.Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, has said she often stays up at night, after long days of campaigning, poring over policy briefing books. At the town hall she drew on her expertise to maneuver away from a statement she made in 2014, saying children crossing the border illegally should be sent back to Central America, which has damaged her with Latinos. She deflected a question about that by insisting she would provide lawyers for children in immigration courts in the United States; children now are not entitled to free representation in those courts. Mrs. Clinton gestured to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, who was in the front row at the event and just happens to have introduced a bill this month to provide lawyers to migrant children. That won her another round of cheers.Mrs. Clinton also pledged she would introduce a bill to overhaul the immigration system, with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, within 100 days of taking office.  Mr. Sanders supports a similar overhaul, but he was less specific about when he would initiate it.Some in the audience booed Mrs. Clinton when she said Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u009cwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a Democrat until he decided to run for president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But on immigration, an issue where Mr. Sanders has been gaining traction among Latinos, Mrs. Clinton had a good night because of those briefing books.Mrs. Clinton once thought she had a lock on Nevada, going into Saturday\u2019s Democratic caucus voting, but the race has tightened as some Latinos, young people and working-class voters have flocked in recent weeks to Mr. Sanders.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Colonial Architecture Fades From Ho Chi Minh City, and Residents Mourn", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byHo Chi Minh City JournalHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 When Nguyen Viet moved back to Vietnam from Britain in 2014, he was hired to write design guidelines for a redevelopment project in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. He had just earned his master\u2019s degree in urban design and planning, and was eager to make an impact.But before he could finish writing the guidelines, a building on the project site \u2014 a 1929 Art Deco apartment beside the former Rue Catinat, once a central artery of French-colonial Indochina \u2014 was demolished.\u201cWhat I realized is that they have very little power,\u201d Mr. Viet, 28, said of his fellow urban planners. \u201cThe fates of the buildings were being decided by someone else.\u201dBut when Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s property market perked up after a slump that followed the 2008 financial crisis, dozens of prewar buildings \u2014 spanning the colonial to modernist eras \u2014 were razed to make room for new ones. As the city\u2019s modest skyline grows, residents are watching with a mixture of awe and trepidation.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of destruction, especially in the last five to seven years, I would say, and mainly by these huge, huge, huge developments,\u201d said Hoanh Tran, design principal at HTA+Pizzini Architects here and a former historic preservation consultant in New York City.Today, many of the city\u2019s remaining colonial-era apartment blocks are mixed-use and charmingly dilapidated, with an entrepreneurial buzz that lures stylish retailers and mom-and-pop vendors alike.A prime example is 151 Dong Khoi Street, a colonial-era building with yellow concrete walls and tiled wall mosaics. Its ground level has an arcade \u2014 once the entrance to the Catinat-Cin\u00e9 movie house \u2014 where vendors hawk greeting cards and inexpensive artwork. But its upper levels house L\u2019Usine, a cafe and lifestyle boutique, and Galerie Quynh, a commercial art gallery that would not look out of place in Paris or New York. Tearing these old buildings down, Mr. Tran said, rips holes in the city\u2019s social fabric.\u201cIf it happens a lot, then in a decade you won\u2019t recognize this place,\u201d he said.The historic downtown already presents a striking contrast to its former self. Its colonial-era cathedral, post office and opera house now sit near glittering malls, apartments and office towers. A handful of 35-plus-story skyscrapers have appeared since 2010, and an 81-story building is being constructed by the private conglomerate Vingroup.Statistics on demolitions are scarce, but the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Development Management Support Center, a French-Vietnamese research agency, found that at least 207 colonial-era villas in two of the city\u2019s 24 districts were demolished or significantly altered from 1994 to 2014.In the past few years, several thousand residents have started to network on new Facebook groups dedicated to celebrating and protecting the city\u2019s historic buildings, several participants said.The groundswell appears to reflect a wider trend: Although Vietnam\u2019s governing Communist Party bans private media and aggressively punishes internal dissidents, the rise of social media has enabled millions of Vietnamese to discuss hot-button social issues online without much fear of reprisal.Thousands of Vietnamese flocked to Facebook last year, for example, to criticize a government plan to cut down and replace 6,700 trees in Hanoi, the capital. City officials eventually backed down.\u201cA lot of young people would like to be part of a movement,\u201d said Nguyen Duc Hiep, an environmental scientist in Australia and a visiting researcher at Ton Duc Thang University here.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to watch and let the authorities decide what should be done; they want to have a voice,\u201d said Mr. Hiep, who is also an administrator of a Facebook group dedicated to vintage shophouses.The public outcry here has largely focused on a plan to overhaul the Saigon Tax Trade Center, a 1924 department store that was drastically transformed over the decades, but whose interior still has wrought-iron balustrades, an intricately tiled floor and grand staircase, and other original design features.The grass-roots advocacy has focused on those features, but aesthetics are not the only motivating factor: Some residents feel protective toward the building because they remember visiting it as children.\u201cIt is the history that the Saigoneers want to keep,\u201d said Tuan A. Phung, the honorary consul general of Finland in Ho Chi Minh City and the leader of a 2014 online petition to save the building. \u201cThe feeling, the atmosphere, memories.\u201dLater in 2014, the Culture Ministry asked the city\u2019s governing People\u2019s Committee to step in. And last year the tax center\u2019s owner, the state-owned Saigon Trading Group, sent local officials a conservation plan for its scheduled redevelopment work.But Mr. Phung said he worried about the plan, which proposes to remove the vintage design features and later reinstall them, because the details were not publicly released.\u201cThey don\u2019t have the habit of being responsive\u201d to public feedback, he said of the company\u2019s executives, who did not respond to interview requests. \u201cInstead they\u2019re responsive to the boss, which is the People\u2019s Committee.\u201dEqually contentious is a plan by Vingroup to build a mixed-use development in Ba Son, a military-controlled naval complex at the edge of downtown.In a brief statement, Vingroup said the project would include commercial, residential and \u201cheritage preservation\u201d elements, including a section with the original Ba Son Shipyard.But the makeover risks treading on a key symbol of Vietnamese nationalism.The naval complex was developed during the Nguyen dynasty and hosted a 1925 labor strike against French industrialists led by future President Ton Duc Thang. In 1993, the Culture Ministry declared the shipyard a national historic site.Architects and other experts say privately that the project\u2019s historical resonance, powerful developer and military association make it politically delicate. And they wonder aloud if most of the site\u2019s historic buildings will be sensitively renovated, or even retained.Nguyen Hong Tien, a Construction Ministry official in Hanoi, said Vingroup\u2019s previous projects in downtown Ho Chi Minh City have benefited the city\u2019s economy and aesthetic.However, he added, \u201cif we just see the immediate benefits of new development, then in the future we cannot restore what we have lost.\u201d\u201cThe key to tourism is creating stories around urban landscapes, and people come here wanting to do Graham Greene tours,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the stuff associated with Graham Greene is gone.\u201dOn that list, he said, is the 1929 apartment that was demolished in 2014, and another historic building along the old Rue Catinat that was replaced by a Vingroup mall.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Californians Fight Over Whether Coast Should Be Rugged or Refined", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It has been one of the most powerful governmental agencies in the nation, with sweeping powers to determine what gets built, or does not get built, on the 1,100 miles of cliffs, mountains and beaches along the Pacific Ocean, one of the country\u2019s great destinations.The fight has highlighted the nuanced position of Mr. Brown on environmental protection and development. He appointed four of the commissioners who state officials say are leading the charge against Mr. Lester. And while Mr. Brown often invokes California\u2019s natural resources, he has at times expressed irritation at what he sees as excessive regulation that has slowed development.The commission was voted into existence under California\u2019s ballot proposition system in 1972, and it was made permanent when Mr. Brown signed the California Coastal Act of 1976 during his first of two consecutive terms as governor.But he grew critical of the commission in the late 1970s after it denied an application by the singer Linda Ronstadt, Mr. Brown\u2019s girlfriend at the time, for work on her home in Malibu. Mr. Brown was elected governor again in 2010 and 2014.Mr. Brown\u2019s press secretary, Evan Westrup, said the governor had not discussed the possible dismissal of Mr. Lester with his appointees. \u201cThis is a personnel matter, initiated without any involvement from our office, for the Coastal Commission to decide,\u201d Mr. Westrup said.Environmentalists, former commission members and state lawmakers \u2014 including the speaker of the State Assembly, Toni Atkins \u2014 have mobilized behind Mr. Lester, describing the effort to fire him as a move by pro-development forces to develop valued coastline.\u201cWe are not just talking about whether or not the current executive director retains his position as executive director,\u201d said Mel Nutter, who was chairman of the commission from 1982 to 1985. \u201cWe are looking at a dynamic where the whole focus and the mission of the commission itself may be at risk.\u201dThe commission applies the strict development and wildlife protection provisions of the state\u2019s Coastal Act to protected coastal land, acting on the recommendations of the commission staff led by Mr. Lester. He declined to be interviewed for this article.\u201cThe California Coastal Commission staff is one of the most difficult bureaucracies to work with, I believe, in the entire United States,\u201d said Fred Gaines, a lawyer and lobbyist who has represented owners of oceanfront homes such as the actor Dustin Hoffman and the director Steven Spielberg. \u201cThey put severe limitation on property owners\u2019 right to use their property.\u201dJana Zimmer, who served on the commission from 2011 to 2015, said environmentalists were unfairly characterizing the intentions of the board, which she said regularly ratified staff recommendations.\u201cMy hope was that I could help to depoliticize the position of the executive director and focus on an array of programmatic concerns that I saw as needing to be addressed to keep the coastal program moving forward,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that my vision has been clear and incisive, and that my performance and accomplishments in the administration of the coastal program have been exceptionally strong.\u201dIn one high-profile case, the commission, after nearly a decade of resistance from environmentalists, last year approved the construction of a five-house compound by Dave Evans, the lead guitarist of U2, who is known as the Edge, on a pristine bluff of oceanfront land in Malibu.The commission is scheduled to vote next month on one of the largest coastal development proposals that has ever come before it: 1,100 acres at Banning Ranch on Newport Beach. The project is said to be worth over $1 billion and has stirred huge community opposition.\u201cThe pressure to develop California\u2019s coast is an everlasting tug of war,\u201d said Stefanie Sekich-Quinn, the coastal preservation manager with the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group. \u201cUnfortunately, we are starting to see special interests gaining some ground. It\u2019s taken us 40 years to protect what we have now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Time-Honored Sport Looks to the Future", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On any given Sunday during football season, the N.F.L., a league that promotes itself as a standard-bearer of innovation, produces games that are analog at their core. The leather ball has been stitched the same way for decades, and the chain gangs hold the first-down markers like crossing guards at a busy street corner. The players smash into one another in a way a fan from a century ago would recognize.Yet the league, a $12-billion-a-year business, seems to be perpetually searching for the best and latest technology to help it deliver that analog product to its nearly 200 million fans, who are increasingly tech-savvy.The juxtaposition can be jarring.Enormous linemen push off one another in a shoving match that recalls something that could have taken place among heavyweights millenniums ago. And then those linemen head to the sideline and grab a tablet computer to scroll through high-definition photographs of their play.In a region filled with private equity titans, dreamy entrepreneurs and futurists, the N.F.L. has been eager to show off its technological chops this week.The Super Bowl host committee has also raised millions of dollars in donations from a range of technology giants, including Apple and Google, two companies not normally associated with the N.F.L. or other sports leagues.Google is paying for its shuttle buses to ferry Bay Area fans to and from the game. Apple is also running company buses to the game, and it has donated iPhones and laptops to the Super Bowl host committee. Still, neither company has pulled out the stops to throw its brand around here in the same way as many other companies.Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s executive vice president for media, is paid to rub shoulders with the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and any other company that will deliver the N.F.L. to fans in a way that complements, but does not dilute, its principal product: the games.While the league may be eager to deliver football to its fans on whatever device they want to use, he said, it is reluctant to let that technology bleed too far into the game.\u201cA lot of that comes from the No. 1 objective, is to keep the competition pure,\u201d Rolapp said moments after attending a panel discussion that included a description of HoloLens, a headset being developed by Microsoft that will show games in \u201caugmented reality.\u201d\u201cAll the stuff we talk about from a business perspective, if the game isn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus should be on the human competition. We\u2019re very protective of that.\u201dHoloLens is in its infancy, but Microsoft was eager to demonstrate to reporters how the device works. In a faux living room with a coffee table, a sofa and football-themed pillows, company technicians showed highlights from a Seahawks-49ers game on a flat-panel television.With the HoloLens headset on, you could see additional statistics to the left and right of the screen. The entire field was in view, not just the portion of the field shown on television. And on the coffee table, a hologram of a play appeared that could be started, stopped and rotated to better analyze the players on the field.Microsoft was careful to distinguish between virtual reality, in which viewers are immersed in a digital world, and HoloLens, which they called a mixed reality, with holograms, other images and data dropped into the field of vision. This, they said, is more complementary to the game.To an older generation of fans who grew up with a few games a week on network television and perhaps a highlight show or two in between, HoloLens may seem to be a high-tech distraction from the game.But the N.F.L. is more focused on younger fans. And if those fans are watching football in new ways and on new devices, then the N.F.L. would be foolhardy not to find ways to reach them.Phil de Picciotto, the president of Octagon Worldwide, a sports marketing agency, said: \u201cFootball, as the leading sports platform, is a reflection of society, and society is more technologically dependent, so it\u2019s logical that the N.F.L. will embrace technology.\u201dInnovative technology, de Picciotto added, has been a part of the N.F.L. for decades, such as the radio headsets in the helmets of quarterbacks and the Telestrator, the device that television analysts use to diagram plays on top of video. Most of these additions did not change the game but aimed to enhance it.What technology is unlikely to do, though, is fundamentally alter the game \u2014 the collisions, the Hail Mary passes, the fist pumps and the high-fives. At least for now.Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Charles was the first black photographer hired by The Times.The images he made reveal a much different Harlem from the one portrayed in the text. Four of his photos made it into print with that article, which most likely had gone through several levels of editors, and the selected images are strong if somewhat predictable: One shows a scene outside a church; another shows men playing cards on the sidewalk.But in the hundreds of other photographs that he shot, visible in the negatives of our archives, a fuller portrait of the neighborhood and Mr. Charles\u2019s neighbors comes into view. The residents of his Harlem are fully rounded people, not caricatures, symbols or subjects to be studied. He had less than two days to shoot this assignment, but his subjects share a dignity that was often missing from much reporting of the era.Though The Times was both lauded and vilified for its reporting from the front lines of the civil rights struggles in the South, there were few black journalists in the industry in those years beyond black news outlets.

{"Headline": "Kenyans Reacquire an Old Taste: Eating Healthier", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "In the 1950s and \u00e2\u0080\u009960s, governments in Africa and Asia started subsidizing the production of staple crops like rice and corn because it was the fastest way to fill bellies and reduce starvation in those regions. Today, needs have changed: The problem is no longer chronic hunger but malnutrition, and the solution is not more calories, but better calories.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a crucial difference. A diet of corn or rice may keep a person alive, but can result in myriad health issues from night-blindness to severe anemia. For decades, however, governments, agriculture companies and development organizations have focused so heavily on staple crop production that Africa and South Asia are now growing too much corn (or maize, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widely known abroad) and rice, says Prabhu Pingali, director of the Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative at Cornell University. Most of the surpluses are used for animal feed, in some cases to drive the growth of industrial animal production.Consider lentils, or dal, in India, a legume that is rich in protein, fiber and key nutrients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor decades, dal prices were rising relative to rice prices, but nobody said anything about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pingali. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s only now that people are saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait a minute. We need dal as much as we need rice. Where\u2019s our dal strategy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dGovernments around the world have long failed to promote the production or availability of a wide range of legumes, vegetables or fruits; in fact, just about every food other than corn, wheat or rice has been neglected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike in many other countries, when you talk about food security, Kenyans are talking about how many bags of maize we have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, a horticultural researcher at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. She has a story to tell about how to start turning things around.Ten years ago, vegetables that had been introduced during colonial times, mainly cabbage, collard greens and kale (sukuma wiki in Swahili), were standard fare in many parts of Kenya, particularly urban areas. Indigenous greens like African nightshade, jute mallow and spider plant had become associated with poverty, and many Kenyans chose not to eat them despite their greater nutritional value.Abukutsa has published more than a dozen studies documenting the robust health benefits of the traditional vegetables, which are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and other micronutrients often lacking in local diets. Moreover, she began working to encourage restaurants and supermarkets to serve or carry these vegetables; she and her students took field trips to help farmers grow them; and she helped to develop and publish recipes to make them more appealing and approachable, since preparation for some of the greens can be rather involved, and some traditional cooking knowledge had become less widespread as the vegetables\u00e2\u0080\u0099 popularity declined. Then she circulated her findings to other researchers, to get them interested in these nutritional powerhouses.Today, restaurants throughout Nairobi serve greens like African nightshade to packed lunch crowds and supermarkets sell out of them while kale wilts on the shelf, a sign that the traditional vegetables have been taking over the exotic varieties. More farmers are growing the indigenous greens, and in the most convincing sign of increasing commercial interest, seed companies are breeding them.Abukutsa has also worked to include the study and breeding of indigenous vegetables in university curriculums, because she knows that horticulture students often go on to become agriculture extension officers, the key source of farming advice for farmers around the country. Five universities now include the cultivation of indigenous fruits and vegetables in their syllabuses, she said. While the obvious goal was to ensure that knowledge about indigenous crops trickled down to farmers, there has also been a potentially more powerful result: The insights that drive these efforts have been trickling up as well, and are making their way into national policy.Historically, Kenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ministries of health and agriculture have operated in isolation from one another, but in 2012, they decided to collaborate on a new agricultural policy that emphasizes more diverse, underutilized and nutrient-dense crops, Abukutsa explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe policy we had before had been focusing more on commercial crops for export and staples,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe needed a policy specifically addressing nutrition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just talking about production.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy proposal has not been published yet because the draft text is not yet in final shape. But when it is, Abukutsa expects that it, like policy declarations before it, will affect the type of training available to farmers through the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extension program and perhaps the types of crops for which research is funded.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe new policy will ensure that when we talk about food security, we are not just talking about maize \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we are talking about all that is available,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The resurgence in popularity of indigenous vegetables is too recent to show an impact on national health statistics, but Abukutsa is confident it will lead to improvement, especially in relation to malnutrition and degenerative diseases. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be tracking the results.Read previous contributions to this series.Other groups too are working to breed and improve the quality of indigenous crops in Kenya and around the globe. The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Center has been leading a campaign to breed and conserve threatened varieties of indigenous fruits such as baobab, bush mango and African plum. It has a team working with small-scale farmers in Cameroon and other parts of Africa to domesticate fruit trees that have always grown in the wild. Largely because of deforestation, the fate of these trees in the wild is uncertain, so domestication may not only preserve them, it may also lead to the development of varieties of trees that will be more nutritious and resilient.Elsewhere, the Taiwan-based World Vegetable Center has been breeding varieties of indigenous vegetables around the world, although its communications director, Maureen Mecozzi, said the work remains an uphill battle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough many countries now recognize the need to encourage production of a more diverse set of crops, developing the policies, funding the research, and building the infrastructure to support that diversity is a big challenge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.So far, there has been no research from which to quantify the changes in Kenyans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 consumption of indigenous fruits and vegetables, the impact of those crops on the nutritional status and overall health of populations. But researchers who work globally, like Pingali, and locally, like Abukutsa, are confident that the only path that makes sense is focusing more on vegetables and other nonstaple crops, whether they are indigenous or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m now of the view that we\u2019ve sort of beat the calorie problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pingali. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if you think towards 2050 horizons, we\u2019ve got the tools and the mechanisms to support the demand for staple grains. Now, a lot of people will argue me on that. But I believe the same people who say we need to double the amount of rice, et cetera, should also be asked: Well, what about tomatoes? What about green beans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you think to the future and the demands for food in the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly focusing on staples puts us in this really funny situation of creating increased imbalance in our diets.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

In the meantime, the less gasoline we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re burning the better off we are.People shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore the fact, though, that the demand is still somewhat driven by the tax credits and portfolio standards. So we still have quite a ways to go, particularly when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get from 20 percent of the energy sources up to the eventual 100 percent we need, where then you run into the big challenge of intermittency [dips and peaks in power as wind and solar sources vary] and the cost of adding storage that would deal with that. This makes the economics dramatically tougher because batteries haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improved that much. Now I and many other people are investing in companies that are going to try and see what we can do with batteries. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not guaranteed that their price will come down a lot. So solar and wind are great, but as they exist today, for countries like India, either in terms of cost or reliability, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get used substantially without innovations in cost and storage or alternative approaches.Being aware of those different costs, we know which things really bring dramatic greenhouse gas reductions, particularly given the goals, reflected in the Paris climate agreement, of getting close to zero emissions. Things that only cut you down even 50 percent, like switching to natural gas, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t achieve the 2050 goal. And so the Coalition will be scrutinizing biofuels to ask if they can be a big part of the solution. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed that people are now looking at the issue comprehensively.

Though many are harmless, if you develop a new floater, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou need to be seen pretty quickly\u00e2\u0080\u009d by an eye doctor in order to rule out a retinal tear or detachment, said Dr. Rebecca Taylor, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.Floaters are caused by clumping of the vitreous humor, the gel-like fluid that fills the inside of the eye. Normally, the vitreous gel is anchored to the back of the eye. But as you age, it tends to thin out and may shrink and pull away from the inside surface of the eye, causing clumps or strands of connective tissue to become lodged in the jelly, much as \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrands of thread fray when a button comes off on your coat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Taylor said. The strands or clumps cast shadows on the retina, appearing as specks, dots, clouds or spider webs in your field of vision.Such changes may occur at younger ages, too, particularly if you are nearsighted or have had a head injury or eye surgery. There is no treatment for floaters, though they usually fade with time.But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still important to see a doctor if new floaters arise because the detaching vitreous gel can pull on the retina, causing it to tear, which can lead to retinal detachment, a serious condition. The pulling or tugging on the retina may be perceived as lightning-like flashes, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike a strobe light off to the side of your vision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Taylor said.See an eye doctor within 24 to 48 hours if you have a new floater, experience a sudden \u00e2\u0080\u009cstorm\u00e2\u0080\u009d of floaters, see a gray curtain or shadow move across your field of vision, or have a sudden decrease in vision.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

I\u2019m going to line \u2018em up like cattle.\u201d Mr. Spotten predicted a large turnout, as many as 2,000 people compared with the 1,260 who caucused four years ago. There would be a surge for Donald J. Trump, he said, but also for other first-timers who wanted to stop Mr. Trump.\u201cMost people I know are apolitical,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. With Trump involved now, a lot people are caring. Either they\u2019re for Trump or against Trump.\u201d With the large influx, Mr. Spotten\u2019s pledge to move things along quickly began to unravel.Joel Merrill, 61, a forklift mechanic who had never caucused before, said: \u201cThere are a number of candidates I like and one in particular I don\u2019t like \u2014 Trump. I\u2019m going to go with Cruz.\u201dMike Rottier, a hardware store owner, said he had been leaning toward Mr. Cruz but disliked his opposition to federal support of ethanol, which is made out of corn, a mainstay of the Iowa economy. \u201cI saw something on Facebook about Rubio\u2019s background, how he came up poor,\u201d he said of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cThat sounds good.\u201dSteve Latta, who works for a farm machinery manufacturer, planned to vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s going to at least try to stick up for America,\u201d he said.Jay Schelhaas, a community college professor, said he liked Mr. Rubio\u2019s and Mr. Cruz\u2019s performance in the last debate in Des Moines, in which Mr. Trump did not participate. \u201cI\u2019m still up in the air between the two,\u201d he said. \u201cListening to their representatives tonight might make the difference.\u201d11 PhotosAfter the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of \u201cOnward Christian Soldiers,\u201d speakers were introduced.

{"Headline": "Michele Fiore, a Nevada Assemblywoman, Finds Unlikely Role at Oregon Standoff\u2019s End", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byA Nevada state lawmaker whose political life has been largely animated by concerns over individual liberty and gun rights emerged as an unlikely figure in negotiating the final stage of the standoff in eastern Oregon on Thursday.Panicked talks between the federal authorities and four holdouts at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge seemed headed toward a dire, perhaps violent, end, when the lawmaker, Michele Fiore, got involved the night before.The holdouts wondered if the agents circling them were planning to gun them down.\u201cThey\u2019re here to kill us,\u201d one said on the phone.Then a new voice piped in \u2014 Ms. Fiore, 45, had been patched into the conversation from the Portland airport. She had just landed as part of a trip intended to show support for the protesters.She seemed to speak their language. Stay calm, she told them. \u201cThe world is watching.\u201dBefore long, the occupiers agreed to turn themselves over to agents of the F.B.I. on Thursday \u2014 accompanied by Ms. Fiore and the evangelist Franklin Graham.Shortly after 11 a.m. on Thursday, she tweeted the news:Who Is Michele Fiore?Ms. Fiore is a second-term assemblywoman representing Nevada\u2019s fourth district. But she might be best known nationally for a Christmas card.\u201cIt\u2019s up to Americans to protect America,\u201d the accompanying text read. \u201cWe\u2019re just your ordinary American family.\u201c-With love & liberty, Michele.\u201dMs. Fiore first made her foray onto the political stage in 2010, as the Tea Party was rising to prominence, by running for Congress. She lost badly, but won an open Assembly seat in 2012. She was re-elected two years later.What Is Her Link to the Standoff in Burns?Ms. Fiore has been a well-known supporter of the family of Cliven Bundy, the rancher who had a standoff with the federal government in 2014 over cattle grazing in Nevada. The F.B.I. arrested Mr. Bundy late Wednesday in Portland.An armed protest at a remote federal wildlife refuge was the latest flare-up in a decades-long struggle over control of federal land.Asked by Mr. Hayes whether she recognized the authority of the federal government, she said: \u201cI recognize the authority that they believe that they have. I just question it.\u201dSince the antigovernment action began in Oregon on Jan. 2, she has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the land-use stances that have radicalized the group, led in part by two of Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons, Ammon and Ryan.After a member of the group was shot dead by police officers during a traffic stop on Jan. 26, Ms. Fiore expressed condolences for the family of the dead man, LaVoy Finicum, on Twitter.She has since portrayed Mr. Finicum\u2019s killing as an unprovoked murder by the police, claiming he had his hands in the air when he was shot.In recent weeks, Ms. Fiore has communicated with members of the armed occupation in Oregon, her executive assistant, Cassidy McGowan, said Thursday.Ms. McGowan said the assemblywoman was able to change the tenor of the standoff because of her unique connection with the occupiers.\u201cPart of their concern was if they got arrested they\u2019d just be forgotten about,\u201d Ms. McGowan said. \u201cAnd she was able to reassure them that will not happen. \u2018I will fight for you. I will fight to make sure that this ends safe. We are here. We care.\u2019 \u201dWhat Are Her Political Views?Ms. Fiore appears to lean strongly libertarian.Her social media accounts are suffused with protestations over claims of government overreach and posts about gun control, an issue she often addresses with images of herself holding weapons.Her public comments have sometimes drawn outrage and, in one case concerning her views on cancer, bafflement.\u201cI\u2019m about to fly to Paris and shoot them in the head myself,\u201d Ms. Fiore said. \u201cI am not O.K. with Syrian refugees. I am not O.K. with terrorists. I\u2019m O.K. with putting them down, blacking them out.\u201dDiscussing a bill she sponsored that would allow guns on college campuses, she said: \u201cIf these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them. The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re in 2015, and we have a black president, in case anyone didn\u2019t notice, so the color and the race issue \u2014 I think it\u2019s time that we put that to rest.\u201d\u201cIf you have cancer, which I believe is a fungus, and we can put a pic line into your body and we\u2019re flushing with, say, salt water, sodium carbonate, through that line and flushing out the fungus,\u201d she said, according to The Post. \u201cThese are some procedures that are not FDA-approved in America that are very inexpensive, cost-effective.\u201dWhat Else Is There to Know About Her? She once had movie aspirations. In the early 2000s, she financed, wrote and starred in the film \u201cSiren,\u201d about a homemaker who tries to make it as a rock star.\u201cI\u2019m an official Sundance reject,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cBut the distributors and producers are here. So I came out, walked up and down Main Street for two days, had the doors slammed in my face. I was just looking for space to show the movie. Everyone said to me, \u2018You can\u2019t come here 10 days before Sundance and set up shop. You can\u2019t do this.\u2019 \u201dMs. Fiore once owned a home health care company called Always There 4 You. Her businesses have sometimes run into problems with government regulators and tax collectors.She has two adult daughters and four grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Says Ted Cruz Stole Victory in Iowa Caucuses", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.Prior to that, he tweeted: Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!More recently:The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!Mr. Trump finished in second in Iowa, after leading public opinion polls there for months. Initially, after losing the state, Mr. Trump was gracious, thanking Iowans in his concession speech and offering Mr. Cruz a kind word on his victory. On Tuesday, though, Mr. Trump vacillated between thanking Iowans and saying he was honored by his showing to saying it wasn\u2019t worth spending his own money on the race because voters didn\u2019t appreciate it. In typical fashion, Mr. Trump first tested lines about Mr. Cruz committing voter fraud in a speech at a rally in New Hampshire, sprinkling it in with a larger address. Mr. Trump is basing his claim on reports that Mr. Cruz\u2019s aides and allies, including Representative Steve King of Iowa, had posted a false report on Twitter that Ben Carson had suspended his campaign while the voting was still going on. The implication is that some of the Carson votes ended up going to Mr. Cruz.By ALAN RAPPEPORTThe billionaire businessman initially struck a magnanimous tone after losing the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last long.Mr. Cruz was brutal in his response to Mr. Trump. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks at a news conference in Goffstown, N.H., on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz assailed Mr. Trump as never before, taunting him as someone who \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinds it very hard to lose\u00e2\u0080\u009d and saying a man with his temperament belonged nowhere near \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe button.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re liable to wake up one morning and Donald, if he were president, would have nuked Denmark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe did not stop there.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a commander in chief, not a twitterer in chief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one dig began.He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d went another.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy girls are five and seven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said at one point. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to tell you, Caroline and Catherine are better behaved than a presidential candidate who responds by insulting everyone every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz also said he did not know anyone \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button\u00e2\u0080\u009d and questioned whether Mr. Trump might skip this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Hampshire debate, as well.But Mr. Cruz was perhaps most forceful describing Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of left-leaning positions, accusing Mr. Trump of supporting \u00e2\u0080\u009camnesty\u00e2\u0080\u009d for undocumented immigrants, noting the developer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for eminent domain and saying his opponent supported \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie Sanders-style socialized medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He repeated his invitation to debate Mr. Trump one-on-one. \u201cWhat Donald does, when he loses, is he blames everybody else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, wrapping up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never Donald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA spokesman for the Republican Party of Iowa did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In an interview with Boston Herald Radio, Mr. Trump said he \u201cprobably\u201d will sue over the results and made clear he believes this is why polls predicting his victory didn\u2019t come true. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a total voter fraud when you think of it and he picked up a lot of those votes and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the polls were so wrong, because of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why the polls were wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also cited other irregularities in Iowa, slamming the Cruz campaign for putting out a misleading mailer that appeared to be from the government. It was labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cVOTER VIOLATION\u00e2\u0080\u009d and warned residents that the secretary of state graded them according to their registration and voter history and they would receive \u00e2\u0080\u009cFs\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they did not vote.The Iowa secretary of state has said the mailers misrepresented the role of his office and Iowa election law.

Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary of state had enabled genocide in Cambodia under Pol Pot.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud to say Henry Kissinger is not my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.She specifically praised Mr. Kissinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomatic achievements in China, where he helped Mr. Nixon normalize diplomatic relations with the Communist leadership in a visit to Beijing in 1972. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was riveted and proud of what America accomplished during what President Nixon called \u00e2\u0080\u0098the week that changed the world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote.Indeed, Mr. Kissinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip looms over much of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences in China as President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top diplomat. Mrs. Clinton sought Mr. Kissinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice when she met with the Chinese state councilor, Dai Bingguo, and the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, who she said \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould become my primary counterparts in the Chinese government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHenry Kissinger had told me how highly he valued his relationship with Dai, whom he found to be one of the most fascinating and open-minded Chinese officials he had ever encountered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton wrote.The squabbling over Mr. Kissinger echoes the deep divisions over the Vietnam War during the early 1970s, when Mr. Kissinger was a main target of the left for the Nixon administration\u2019s conduct of the war.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI even enlisted Henry Kissinger to make the strategic case to him in August 2011,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

I\u2019m here to say I\u2019m on the side of the murdered.\u201dThere are differences between what Beyonc\u00e9 did and Mr. Tarantino did to draw criticism. Mr. Tarantino, who is white, faced anger from police groups over a direct remark. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s message was unspoken, though still perceived as a threat. In both cases, the backlash was severe.Victor Kappeler, the dean of the School of Justice Studies at Eastern Kentucky University who has studied policing practices for more than 40 years, said that responses like these were part of a relatively new phenomenon by the police: being \u201cpolitically active.\u201dMr. Kappeler noted that many police departments and groups now use social media and the Internet to \u201csway public opinion about their practices,\u201d including with statements like the one issued in Miami, and they also publish positive stories about their work on social media. Those methods, he said, try to reinforce \u201cthe reductionist notion that repeats a mantra: good cop, bad cop,\u201d and that there are only a few bad apples in police departments.Mr. Kappeler added that police unions tend to elect as leadership the most \u201caggressive\u201d members from their ranks to protect the police from criticism.\u201cYou have to understand that that\u2019s part of their culture,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who tries to tarnish the devotion of the police as heroes or breaks out of that discourse is subject to a lot of police scrutiny or blowback statements.\u201dBoth fatal shootings fueled nationwide debate over race relations, but police supporters have rejected the sentiment of the resulting protests. \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot was built on a lie,\u201d the statement from the Miami police union said.In Tampa, Fla., reports said the city\u2019s police union had also chosen to boycott Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s concert there, but Stephen Hegarty, a spokesman for the Tampa Police Department, said in an interview that the reports were overblown.Mr. Hegarty called the media attention around the boycott \u201csensational,\u201d but added, \u201cit is true that many police officers feel strongly about it.\u201d Police volunteers who do choose to work the event can earn $34 an hour for providing security \u2014 those fees are paid by the event hosts (in this case, Beyonc\u00e9) and not by the police department, Mr. Hegarty said.

{"Headline": "Under Steve Burke, Old-Media NBCUniversal Shows Off Some New Tricks", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut Comcast startled investors and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media. Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of so-called cord cutters by adding video subscribers, but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Universal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent. Over all, NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent. Comcast doesn\u2019t break out earnings for NBCUniversal, but operating cash flow rose 8.7 percent.Since 2009, when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric (an acquisition completed five years ago), NBCUniversal\u2019s cash flow has doubled. The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Strong franchises \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at \u201cNightly News\u201d) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at \u201cToday\u201d).I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal\u2019s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It\u2019s all about the people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.\u201dMr. Burke grew up in broadcast television \u2014 his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.Today much of Mr. Burke\u2019s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling \u2014 and in some cases ejecting \u2014 high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (\u201cAgonizing,\u201d Mr. Burke told me.)He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the \u201cTonight\u201d show a year before Mr. Leno\u2019s contract was set to expire.Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can\u2019t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals \u2014 NBC\u2019s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d for example \u2014 are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke\u2019s boss.While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he\u2019s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. \u201cI had to be stern,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cPeople thought everything was fine. It wasn\u2019t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,\u201d meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters \u2014 which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves \u2014 a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It\u2019s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I\u2019m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. \u201cThe previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cComcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We\u2019ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, \u2018Keep reinvesting.\u2019 The returns are stellar.\u201dUniversal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBig media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn\u2019t already reside in the company.\u201dInvestors have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown: Comcast stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18; Netflix\u2019s is 324 and Amazon\u2019s is 425, meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companies.Still, as old and new media converge, and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance, it may be worth asking how much old-media DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren\u2019t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal\u2019s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.Still, it\u2019s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. \u201cI\u2019m a product of my dad\u2019s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cI developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Burke\u2019s title at Comcast. He is senior executive vice president, not president.Advertisement"}

Cook.While these companies have said they would comply, when legally obliged to, with handing over information on their users, they say they believe that creating technological back doors to their digital systems can lead to potential abuse by governments worldwide.For Facebook, which has almost 1.6 billion global users, the encryption debate is only one of the growing number of policy hurdles that the company needs to overcome as it expands its global presence.Speaking on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company wanted to offer Internet connectivity to the developing world that did not have digital access and that Facebook would look for ways to continue doing that in India and beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to the mission that we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said about the recent decision in India that outlawed Free Basics. \u201cWhat works in one country may not work in another.\u201dDespite his attempts to downplay the setback, the recent decision by Indian regulators has put Facebook and its 31-year-old chief executive in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality.Internet giants like Facebook and Google can expect more scrutiny around the world as they continue to expand, said Pierre Louette, a deputy chief executive of Orange, the former French telecommunications monopoly. When confronted with this scrutiny, he added, tech companies may look to build bridges with traditional telecom operators that have faced similar regulatory challenges for decades.\u201cThey need more friends than before,\u201d said Mr. Louette, in reference to global tech companies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Post-Cubicle Office and Its Discontents", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueBeige partitions have given way to napping lofts, lunch gazebos and lots of open space. But are employees any happier or more productive?Supported byBut these days, to lament cubicles is to miss the point. Looking at the most sophisticated office spaces is to see that the lessons of Roethke and Bartleby \u2014 the design lessons, at any rate \u2014 have been learned. The offices of the ad agency Hi-ReS! in Berlin, designed by the German architecture firm Studio A/S, are painted garish colors \u2014 the workplace analogue of sucking on a Gobstopper \u2014 and crammed with a variety of spaces. No one sits in little cubicles: After a conference at a yellow table, you might climb a red ladder to a small loft, snuggling up against pillows while flicking through emails or furtively napping. The headquarters for the mobile-gaming company King, maker of Candy Crush Saga, is similarly brash and childlike, its employees working among brightly colored pink and green partitions and lunching under yellow-and-white gazebos. At the highest end, big-name architects treat the office like some spacecraft landed from the future. Zaha Hadid\u2019s plans for a research center for Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, explode the usual boxy building envelope in favor of a network of woozily distorted honeycomb cells.Over the last century, the office has been continually improved upon, in an attempt to make it work better and be a better place to work. But the whimsy and extravagance of the contemporary office is something new. Even when they were luxurious, the early offices of the 20th century were never wacky. Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Larkin Administration Building from 1906 contained a soaring central light court and recreation rooms for its largely female staff: amenities that were unheard-of at the time. But no one was encouraged to take naps; there were no secret doors leading to interior \u2018\u2018speakeasies,\u2019\u2019 like the one at LinkedIn\u2019s offices in New York. Early offices were designed to extract relentless productivity from workers. The prodigal offices of today are the logical endpoint of a decades-long backlash against this way of thinking.The influential American management theorist Frederick Winslow Taylor was the first to apply the principles of efficiency to office design. W. H. Leffingwell, a Taylor disciple, suggested in his treatise \u2018\u2018Scientific Office Management\u2019\u2019 (1917) that a poorly placed water fountain could lead to unnecessary miles being walked by an average worker \u2014 which, multiplied by many workers over 52 workweeks, might mean tens of thousands of miles of wasted steps. Taylorist offices consisted of serried rows of desks, perfectly arranged to facilitate the flow of bodies through space. It was a model of existence that, like a hectoring fitness app, reduced human beings to bundles of numbers.Workers, unsurprisingly, hated these spaces and in the 1930s began to voice their grievances. The first strike in book publishing took place in the 1930s, and around the same time the staff of The New Republic unionized. The workers weren\u2019t, of course, striking for better design, but it was better design that they got, along with more \u2018\u2018caring\u2019\u2019 corporate policies: pensions, company picnics and, during the postwar boom, a significant and steady increase in salaries. A reaction against the factorylike office set in among planners and designers: Rather than treat its workers like machines, an office should cater to their psychology.What followed, in the postwar decades, was the era of the glass-and-steel, air-conditioned box. Now ubiquitous and unremarkable, they were at the time considered architectural and design marvels. Descriptions of life in these companies sound conspicuously like the Googles and Facebooks of today: \u2018\u2018Imagine a sea of blond desks with tan chairs, outdoor lighting pouring in everywhere, roomy offices with individually controlled air-conditioning and area-controlled Music by Muzak coming out of the walls.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s from Alan Harrington\u2019s \u2018\u2018Life in the Crystal Palace,\u2019\u2019 a rueful account of life in a wealthy suburban corporation in the mid-1950s. \u2018\u2018At noon, enjoy movies in an auditorium the size of a small theater, visit the library, watch the World Series on color TV or play darts and table tennis in the game room.\u2019\u2019 Harrington, a quintessential and self-conscious \u2018\u2018organization man,\u2019\u2019 spends a lot of time wondering whether these initiatives sap, rather than encourage, creativity.Lennee in Talinn, Estonia, designed by Kamp Architecture.Attempts to improve the office resulted in some significant innovations, like coordinating furniture design with the architecture of a space. But there were some impressive failures, too. The most infamous was the standard cubicle: Invented by the furniture company Herman Miller in the 1960s, it quickly became a company\u2019s favorite design tool for squeezing more people into less space for as little money as possible (until they were laid off). By the 1990s, thanks above all to the comic strip \u2018\u2018Dilbert,\u2019\u2019 which debuted in 1989, it had become the classic symbol of a stymied white-collar existence \u2014 a source of the so-called cubicle rage that supposedly led to workplace shootings.The sudden efflorescence of the tech industry in the late \u201990s took us from the desert of cubicles to the milk-and-honey offices of today. Many of the dot-commers had graduated from (or, very often, dropped out of) cozy university campuses to toil in big corporations. Starting their own companies, they recreated the effortless drift between work and play that characterized their college lives. The cubicle walls came down, and in the wide, open warehouse and loft spaces they occupied, exceptionally long workdays would be punctuated by frenzied Mario Kart races or fierce Ping-Pong battles. Creating a playful office became one of the standard ways of attracting skilled employees in a competitive environment: The hope was that a talented engineer wouldn\u2019t leave a tech behemoth for the dinky start-up next door that didn\u2019t have a gym and a resistance pool. Thus has the \u2018\u2018fun office\u2019\u2019 spread throughout the world.Studio A/S, the German design firm, captures the zeitgeist in describing its aims: \u2018\u2018Generation Y\u2019\u2019 is searching for \u2018\u2018greater meaning\u2019\u2019 from office design; a new generation \u2018\u2018wants poetry, form and atmosphere\u2019\u2019 in its workplaces. The design firm Teknion uses the word \u2018\u2018ethonomics\u2019\u2019 to describe the principles that ought to apply to the contemporary office. The idea is that design \u2014 by softly coercing people into walking more and being more active, incorporating nature through bountiful plants and better lighting and creating environments that evoke many different textures and moods through the use of varied materials \u2014 can help foster the new \u2018\u2018ethical workplace.\u2019\u2019Office design concerned with employees\u2019 happiness, well-being, instincts for play \u2014 this ought to be the best of all possible worlds. There is no question that such offices look vastly more inviting than your average cubicle farm; it\u2019s not surprising that so many companies seek to emulate them. Yet the \u2018\u2018disruptive\u2019\u2019 thinking that insists a workplace ought to care not just for your average needs (supplies, potable coffee, a microwave) but for your deepest psychological ones as well has its insidious side. If the new workplace technology makes it impossible to leave work at work, the \u2018\u2018ethonomic\u2019\u2019 thinking behind new workplace design is intended to make it increasingly difficult to separate our work lives from everything else. The sociologist William Davies has dubbed this complex of ideas \u2018\u2018the happiness industry,\u2019\u2019 wherein your most private emotions and \u2014 through the introduction of \u2018\u2018wellness\u2019\u2019 programs at work \u2014 even your health are now intimate concerns of your boss. One of the most popular and cited gurus of the new workplace, Tony Hsieh, the C.E.O. of Zappos, has argued that companies ought to employ \u2018\u2018chief happiness officers\u2019\u2019 to ensure enthusiasm at the office. He has also suggested that they regularly identify the 10 percent of workers who share the least enthusiasm for the \u2018\u2018happiness agenda\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and fire them.Ultimately it\u2019s not clear whether the new offices work in the way they\u2019re advertised. Even when common spaces are covered over in beautiful, bright plywood paneling, as with Lenne in Tallinn, Estonia, the actual desks are often in open-plan setups. The move to take people out of private offices, the better to improve collaboration and productivity, has little empirical justification. Most widely cited studies of employee satisfaction tend to run against such trends in office design. A study from The Journal of Environmental Psychology in 2013 indicated that 50 percent of workers in open-plan spaces suffer from a lack of sound privacy, and 30 percent complain about a lack of visual privacy.In 1980, the futurologist Alvin Toffler predicted that with increases in telecommuting technology, offices would soon become irrelevant. Downtowns would be emptied, and everyone would be connected through \u2018\u2018electronic cottages\u2019\u2019 dispersed throughout the countryside. Digital advances in the years since have constantly threatened to make Toffler\u2019s fanciful vision a real one. It has come true in one sense: We do often work at home. But we also work at work, before going home to work more. Commuting and telecommuting exist in an unholy alliance. The office has persisted, becoming even bigger, weirder, stranger: a symbol of its outsize presence in our lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Tools to Keep Those Creepy Online Ads From Watching You", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAY you\u2019re doing a web search on something like the flu. The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol.The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television.This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets.\u201cOur privacy is completely under assault with all these connected devices,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties \u2014 like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies \u2014 that compile information on consumers.When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals.The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits.The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an add-on for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The anti-tracking companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist.Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said.\u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users.\u201d\u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities.\u201dIn our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday.com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight.But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first.\u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground.\u201dIn the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content.Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles; on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re talking megabillion-dollar industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I shot the red carpet, and that was it. I shot film and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a tight deadline. At that time, The Times would run the red carpet story the Tuesday following the awards.What is the difference between 1999 and last year?The difference is the technology and new media. The fan base has always been there, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even larger now because of the technology that lets people experience this on their phones. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an insatiable appetite for films and movie stars.Now the Oscars photos are essentially broadcast live. You take a photo, and it ends up on the New York Times home page minutes later.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone from dropping film overnight and picking it up the next morning to transmit, to running memory cards to an on-site editor to beat the closing time for the next day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper. When the first wireless transmitters came out, we started using them. We work under an extremely tight deadline on East Coast time.Josh Haner made all the difference when he devised an ingenious system where every single frame we shoot is transmitted immediately to the editors in New York. They are actually seeing the pictures in real time. They caption them with the names of the stars and the designer and post them on the web.You work on a lot of serious, in-depth stories. Yet these award shows are among the most popular slideshows we do.Yes. The Oscar slide shows get the most views of any shows all year, which is quite amazing. Last year, it got over three million views over all. But do you want to hear something incomprehensible to me? The red carpet slide shows for last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Golden Globes got 13 million page views. And that\u2019s pretty much somebody posing in an evening gown. But we were faster. We were beating the wires. They were still dealing with on-site editors.What is involved in shooting the red carpet?We have more access now so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten much more interesting and challenging. It used to be all about logistics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 setting up days in advance to make sure all that technology works.I have shot every position, from the red carpet to the photo room, where there are bleachers full of hundreds of photographers screaming at the winners when they come to pose for pictures;\u00c2\u00a0to a position inside of the theater, which is essentially what is seen on television.Once I got the\u00c2\u00a0backstage position in 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and along with that the ability to move around on the red carpet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I could roam, take pictures, observe and work the light. You\u2019re not in one position waiting for something to happen in front of you. You can actually start to take real pictures. The first year, I felt like a kid in a candy store.And how did this happen?It took many years of asking. Only a handful of photographers are granted that access, and the biggest news and entertainment organizations are represented. The New York Times is one of them, and our reach has grown tremendously, especially the last few years, through our website and social media.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it like to be in the bleachers?You get into your position in the photo room and everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dressed in formal attire. You wait for the winners to come in with their awards and when they do the whole room just goes crazy. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stage that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set up and they pose with their statues.You just try to capture whatever moment you can with somebody standing in front of you posing.And the other photographers screaming in your ears.Yes, but sometimes that might work to your advantage if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting next to somebody who gets the winner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention and they kind of look your way. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not inclined to scream at people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just pandemonium.Then the celebrity walks away and everything quiets down. The next one comes and the room erupts again. It can be entertaining, but also sort of a sensory overload at times.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at my best when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like the only photographer around. And so this is quite the opposite. The red carpet positions are pretty much the same. Essentially you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck in a tiny position waiting for somebody to walk by and pose and you try to make visual sense. You want to make a clean image, but you want to make an interesting one. Sometimes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a little limited and they breeze past you.Are you taking note of the clothes or are you just trying to make a sharp head-to-toe image?A little bit of both. There are some dresses that do really stand out. Now, being able to roam on the carpet, you can be a lot more discerning. You can follow a person or gown that looks really great. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in position you really have to get it while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there. It\u2019s like shooting theater or sports. It takes a lot of technical prowess \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you really have to be on top of it. You have to capture that moment. Once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone.Half of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watching what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening onstage. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it like backstage?It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really quite impressive and a little intimidating at first.\u00c2\u00a0There is so much activity going on\u00c2\u00a0in a crowded, confined space. I\u2019m fairly new to it and there are great photographers like Al Seib of The L.A. Times who have been shooting backstage for a long time. I learned a lot from them.I use flash sparingly and shoot with fast primes because if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shooting into a black hole it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always look good and it creates a big disturbance. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll raise my ISO as high as 6400, and work with the light that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there.There are all the stagehands and different sets coming in and moving out at a very fast pace. And you have to stay out of the way of the performers, musicians, presenters and stage managers. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to interfere with their flow but you still want to get your pictures. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of an intricate dance, knowing when to step in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and knowing when to step out.What have been your most memorable Oscar moments?Backstage, when Lupita Nyong\u00e2\u0080\u0099o won, she had a big smile on her face and then she came out and she was just so quiet (Slide 10). She just stood there like she was just trying to take it all in, but it was just such a quiet moment. I mean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much excitement and activity going on all the time, and I was just there, shooting, and it was dark.As photographers we see so many famous people, presidents and stars, that we have been somewhat inoculated against being impressed. And then every once in a while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s someone you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re impressed by.The most obvious\u00c2\u00a0pictures are of the famous people onstage. But I have to remind myself to resist the urge to blast away when I see a familiar face and to look for\u00c2\u00a0something that is interesting in that moment, even if it\u2019s an expression or a gesture.In some ways it\u2019s like shooting politics. I went to Nevada for the caucuses, stayed for a week and flew back on Wednesday to go straight from the airport to the Oscars venue for the first walk-through.\u00c2\u00a0So I went from one American ritual to another.How are they similar and how are they different?Well, there are the obvious differences: One group of people is dressed much more elegantly than the other.The similarities are that these are rituals the American public feels that it has a vested interest in. And that dominate our television screens and social media. People can get very passionate about entertainment and politics.They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both theater.The challenging part of both is finding the real human moments in between the staged moments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 finding something that looks different from what everybody else is shooting.\u00c2\u00a0I mean not only the angles, but also the little off-moments.\u00c2\u00a0Like the workers who are behind the scenes carrying the big Oscar statues around.Did you watch the Oscars when you were growing up?Absolutely.I love movies. The town I grew up in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a small suburb east of L.A. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had a drive-in that played all the first run movies. I saw all the movies of the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s there with my parents: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Godfather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Exorcist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cJaws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarnal Knowledge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We went to the movies every single week. That was a big part of my life growing up. I always watched the Academy Awards. The Oscars were a special occasion when I could stay up late and watch the show with my parents.\u00c2\u00a0I never dreamt that I would get so close to the actual awards ceremony.So I wonder whether the 8-year-old Monica, what she would have thought about the fact that you are now backstage.Actually the 40-something Monica would be pretty impressed, after all the years of shooting from all the other positions.I remember watching in the living room with the family. I remember the streaker one year, and when Marlon Brando, sent the Native American woman (Sacheen) Littlefeather to decline his award. I remember Jane Fonda. It\u2019s a reflection of society and the times.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on this year, too. I remember the palpable elation when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won the Best Actor and Best Actress awards the same year, in 2002."}

{"Headline": "Poll Watch: Donald Trump\u2019s Curiously Strong Support Among Evangelicals", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "So far, evangelical voters in three states have weighed in on their preference in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. In both Iowa and New Hampshire, evangelical voters were less likely than non-evangelical voters to support Donald Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by 7 and 11 points, respectively.But South Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary on Saturday was a notable change in this trend. According to the exit polls, white evangelical voters were actually a few percentage points more likely than other voters to support Mr. Trump.The willingness of evangelicals to support Mr. Trump played a vital role in his victory in the state. South Carolina has the highest proportion of evangelicals of all three states that have voted so far, making it difficult to win without their strong support. Evangelicals make up nearly three-quarters of Republican primary voters in the state. Reflecting Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength among this group, they also accounted for about three quarters of his entire vote total.In some ways, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success in attracting votes from evangelicals seems odd. He has made perhaps the least effort of any Republican candidate to showcase his religiosity. And when he has done so, it has not always gone smoothly, saying, for example, that he did not believe he needed to seek forgiveness from God. Mr. Trump also performs the worst of all remaining candidates among voters who say it is most important to have a candidate who shares their values.There is a danger, however, in stereotyping evangelical voters as a homogeneous bloc that prioritizes religious belief and religious observance above all other concerns. In fact, only 4 in 10 evangelicals in South Carolina said that the most important quality to them was having a candidate who shares their values. This number is about the same as the total of evangelical voters who place a top priority on bringing about needed change (one in four) and telling it like it is (one in seven) \u2013 the two qualities that voters associated most strongly with Mr. Trump.Over all, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong showing among evangelicals in South Carolina serves as a reminder that these voters have multiple interests. Some of these interests will steer them towards candidates \u2013 like Senator Ted Cruz \u2013 who choose to play up their ties to these voters. But their other interests may have little to do with their religious orientation, and will sometimes be weighed more heavily in determining whom to support.David R.

{"Headline": "A Good Muffin Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Bad for You", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byRecipe LabThe New American Breakfast is, no doubt, a wonderful thing. Bone broth, green juice, salmon jerky and medium-chain triglyceride oils will soon make us a faster, thinner and sharper nation. The Old American Breakfast \u2014 with sweet indulgences like sticky buns, doughnuts, pancakes and waffles \u2014 has been labeled hazmat by nutrition authorities, and rightly so.But some of us still hold this truth to be self-evident: Sugar and starch are the best possible companions for morning coffee.Muffins can be a happy compromise between old and new, especially if you make them yourself. This master recipe for whole grain berry muffins is both extremely flexible and extremely rewarding. They are sweet but not sugary, packed with whole grains but not dense, and reasonably rich in fiber, protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. And they freeze beautifully; these muffins can go from a 300-degree oven to the weekday breakfast table (or the car) in about 20 minutes. If baked right, they even have the high-domed, crunchy top that is, as everyone knows, the best part.As long as the oven is hot, the batter is thick and the leavening is strong, perfect muffins are within the reach of any home cook.At some point, the distinction between cake and muffin seems to have been lost.The difference is not only in the pan, said Ms. Chang, who is both a pastry chef and a recovering mathematician, but also in the proportions.Cake is rich and sugary, with a fine crumb; muffins are lofty, open and less sweet. Cake is a dessert, but a good muffin can be a meal. (But it does not have to weigh as much as one. Heavy, dense muffins are the result of too much of one whole grain \u2014 bran, most often \u2014 and not enough flour or leavening.)To develop a master recipe for a muffin that is sustaining, filling and reasonably sweet, I synthesized mounds of advice into a few guidelines: Mix whole grains with all-purpose flour, use slightly processed ingredients like maple syrup and coconut oil whenever possible, and go heavy on nuts and fruit.\u201cWith fruit as a sweetener, your mouth doesn\u2019t miss the sugar as much,\u201d Ms. Chang said. Dried fruit, since it is so concentrated, can be very high in sugar and calories. Now that fresh berries are available year round, they are an even better \u2014 and juicier \u2014 choice.Next I dived into batters, leavening and add-ins. (Surprise tip: There\u2019s no need to toss berries in flour before adding them to these muffins; this batter is so thick that they do not sink). I merged whole grain combinations from my favorite bakers into a formula that is delicious but not at all dense: equal parts wheat germ, cornmeal and rolled oats, combined with an equivalent amount of white flour. The whole grain options can be interchanged with millet, spelt, bran and other grains, but using a mix, rather than just one, is key. White flour is needed not only for taste but also for lightness: Its gluten content allows the batter to stretch, rise and bake up high.To maximize the tops, I decided to double up on baking soda and baking powder. This gives the batter a better shot at rising, since both whole grains and home appliances prevent leaveners from doing their best work. I ignored the usual cautions about overfilling the tins, piling in as much batter as each cup would hold \u2014 and then a little more in the center. (If you do this, grease the entire top of the tin, so the muffin tops don\u2019t get stuck once they puff up and out of the cup.)Sprinkling a streusel topping over the batter also helps make a crunchy muffin top, and the orange zest I added to this one makes a wonderful counterpoint to the blueberries. But if cutting down on sugar is a priority, simply sprinkle on a few grains of raw sugar \u2014 or leave the tops alone.Some bakers warn that muffin batter should be rushed into the oven as soon as it is mixed so that the leavening effect isn\u2019t lost. But I learned that resting the batter, which gives the grains a chance to soften and absorb the liquid, produces a whole grain muffin of surpassing height and tenderness. Ms. Chang stores all of her batters overnight in the refrigerator before baking in order to get a superior crumb. I mimicked her method by leaving it on the counter for an hour and found that as long as you do not vigorously mix the batter at any point, which does have a deflating effect, the air bubbles will expand and the baking powder will redouble its efforts when the heat of the oven hits the pan.Double-acting baking powder, the only kind widely available now, is so called because its leavening is activated twice; once when it is mixed with liquid, then again when it is exposed to heat. Baking soda is activated when mixed with liquid and acid, which is why tangy buttermilk is used in this (and many other) baking recipes. Since lightness is key to the success of this recipe, do check your baking soda and baking powder for signs of age; if you\u2019re unsure just how long that box of baking soda has been sitting around, go for it and invest in a new one.Ms. Chang began to research \u201cBaking With Less Sugar\u201d not as a working manual but for her own use in an effort to limit the amount of sugar her family eats at home \u2014 a professional hazard for bakers. In her bakeries, she said, sticky buns rule supreme. And with a doughnut shop on every corner in the Boston area (where Dunkin\u2019 Donuts was born in 1950), her products have to stand out.\u201cPeople come into a bakery expecting a treat,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trick is to give them that feeling without just adding more and more sugar.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

Are you just a little too in love with your own Instagram feed?As the generation who grew up with social media, a reflection on narcissism is of critical importance to teenagers. What are the psychological and ethical implications of constant engagement with or obsession over social media? How does it change our relationship with others and how we see ourselves?My teenage son recently informed me that there is an Internet quiz to test oneself for narcissism. His friend had just taken it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did it turn out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says he did great!\u00e2\u0080\u009d my son responded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe got the maximum score!\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen I was a child, no one outside the mental health profession talked about narcissism; people were more concerned with inadequate self-esteem, which at the time was believed to lurk behind nearly every difficulty. Like so many excesses of the 1970s, the self-love cult spun out of control and is now rampaging through our culture like Godzilla through Tokyo.A 2010 study in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that the percentage of college students exhibiting narcissistic personality traits, based on their scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, a widely used diagnostic test, has increased by more than half since the early 1980s, to 30 percent. In their book \u00e2\u0080\u009cNarcissism Epidemic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the psychology professors Jean M. Twenge and W. Keith Campbell show that narcissism has increased as quickly as obesity has since the 1980s. Even our egos are getting fat.It has even infected our political debate. Donald Trump? \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemarkably narcissistic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the developmental psychologist Howard Gardner told Vanity Fair magazine. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say whether Mr. Trump is or isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a narcissist. But I do dispute the assertion that if he is, it is somehow remarkable.This is a costly problem. While full-blown narcissists often report high levels of personal satisfaction, they create havoc and misery around them. There is overwhelming evidence linking narcissism with lower honesty and raised aggression. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notable for Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day that narcissists struggle to stay committed to romantic partners, in no small part because they consider themselves superior.The full-blown narcissist might reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But narcissism isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an either-or characteristic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a set of progressive symptoms (like alcoholism) than an identifiable state (like diabetes).

And that is just fine with some Democrats.While it might make it harder for Senate Democrats and the White House to force consideration of the eventual nominee, the decision by the vulnerable Republicans sets up the clear contrast that Democrats want in the handful of key races likely to decide Senate control in November.Senator Rob Portman of Ohio joined Republican Senate colleagues Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire in coming out for the delay on Monday. Republicans say they do not believe that getting behind the call to put off the confirmation will be that damaging and that Republican voters will reward them for doing so.Democrats see it very differently.

{"Headline": "David Boies\u2019s Dual Roles at Theranos Set Up Conflict", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorTheranos, a blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes when she was 19, is fighting for its survival. After reports in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about the company\u2019s technology, Theranos has been in a tailspin.The company\u2019s methodology and science are in doubt, a federal regulator found that one lab had violated several clinical standards and the drugstore chain Walgreens has suspended tests at a Theranos lab in California.Theranos is fighting back, claiming that its technology is valid and asserting that the facts will prevail as its technology is scientifically tested.At the center of the company\u2019s defense is Mr. Boies, a founder and the chairman of Boies Schiller & Flexner.Mr. Boies is known as one of the smartest and shrewdest litigators in the country. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential dispute, he litigated the Microsoft antitrust case for the federal government, and he is representing Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, in his suit against the government.In the wake of the questions being asked about Theranos, the company hired Mr. Boies. He had represented Theranos before and his firm\u2019s ties with the company ran deep. The general counsel of Theranos is a former Boies Schiller partner.That Mr. Boies is representing an embattled client is nothing new. But this time, the lawyer has raised the ante by becoming a director of Theranos.Let\u2019s stop here and note that this has the potential to blow up. Mr. Boies is taking on two different roles at Theranos. A lawyer represents a client \u2014 here Theranos \u2014 while a director, even at a privately held company like Theranos, represents the company\u2019s investors.Depending on what unfolds at Theranos, Mr. Boies may be put in a position where he either has to protect the company (as its lawyer) or the shareholders (as a director).I asked one of my colleagues, Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in business ethics, about this potential conflict. She was skeptical of Mr. Boies\u2019s dual role.\u201cI have a hard time believing that an experienced litigator can adequately represent investors \u2014 one of the primary responsibilities of a director \u2014 while being attentive to potential legal strategies, which might cause him to privilege the interests of management,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt just seems a difficult line to walk.\u201dNo doubt Theranos waived the conflict in lots of documented forms. And the American Bar Association does allow this type of dual role. But just because a conflict is allowed doesn\u2019t mean it will not lead to problems.If the technology of Theranos turns out to be not what it claims, investors would almost certainly seek to sue the chief executive, Ms. Holmes, and the company, as well as the board that allowed this to happen.This gets complicated for Mr. Boies, because Theranos is a corporate governance disaster.Ms. Holmes controls the company, and she solidified that control in 2013 by arranging for the company to adopt a high-vote stock structure that gave her most of the votes. This is a problem because the company is essentially Ms. Holmes, although it has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from outside investors. She founded it, had the idea and has led the technology. If the technology is shown to be flawed, she may not be quick to admit that to the benefit of the remaining shareholders.Mr. Boies, of course, is no expert in blood testing technology. But in evaluating the firm\u2019s technology, he will get little to no help from his fellow board members. Before the first Journal article appeared, the board of Theranos had no outside scientific experience. It consisted mainly of statesmen, including two former senators and even Henry Kissinger. Most of these board members have now been demoted to advisers.The Theranos board is now five people, including Ms. Holmes and the company\u2019s chief operating officer. None of the rest have scientific experience. Two other directors are a retired Marine Corps general and the chief executive of Bechtel, the construction company. Then there is Mr. Boies.This is, frankly, a weak board and another potential land mine for Mr. Boies, as the weakness of the board does not lessen the fiduciary duty he has to all Theranos shareholders.The potential for conflict is particularly great. What if Ms. Holmes resists changes that would be in the interest of shareholders? What if the board decides that it is time for her to go \u2014 and she stands her ground?The board could do little more than throw up its collective hands under the current governance structure.Mr. Boies, and the other outside directors, could resign in protest. But why would anyone, particularly Mr. Boies, be a director on a board that lacked the power to make fundamental changes?A request for comment to Boies Schiller was referred to a representative who declined to comment. Theranos did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.There is also a lesson for those venture capitalists who invested in Theranos.The recent bubbly years when unicorns \u2014 start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more \u2014 seemed to emerge almost daily led venture capitalists to agree to governance structures that placed all power with the founder. After all, this is a structure that worked for Facebook.But Theranos is no Facebook. That Theranos had no real board in place and took repeated steps to place all power with Ms. Holmes may not have been a problem when Theranos was a start-up darling. But now, Theranos has fallen and will have to prove itself. Governance matters most in crisis times, and Theranos lacks it, to the chagrin of its investors. Even Mark Zuckerberg put together a real board and hired Sheryl Sandberg as a check.One has to wish Mr. Boies luck. If Theranos turns wildly successful, then there will be no problem. But if its troubles continue, he will have to do something he is less experienced at \u2014 be a director and corporate leader. The question will be whether the litigator in him will prevent that.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Court, and F.B.I. Presses Congress to Settle iPhone Privacy Fight", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOther technology companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo \u2014 also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201dThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201dIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201dApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201dA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201dApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked information about the government\u2019s mass surveillance programs.Katie Benner and Nick Wingfield reported from San Francisco and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.

Praising Mrs. Clinton as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca change agent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton started the list with her first post-college job with the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defense Fund in South Carolina, following with what he characterized as her dogged pursuit of early childhood and adult educational programs while he was governor of  Arkansas. He singled out Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters, a program Ms. Clinton first learned of in Israel and imported to Arkansas. Her efforts, he said, benefited Arkansas\u2019s poor from African-Americans in the Mississippi River Delta to the mostly white Ozark Mountains. He also praised Clinton Foundation programs that provided two million clean-air cook stoves to families in poor countries and a generic drug program in Africa that he said increased the number of people receiving antimalarial drugs to 5.4 million from 1.7 million in the last several years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know those three and a half million people whose lives were saved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where they live, they know.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome in the audience, like Daniel Cash, 51, a contractor, and Rena Jefferson, 40, who owns a home-cleaning business, remain undecided between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like some of the stuff Sanders is saying and some of what Clinton is saying,\u201d Mr. Cash said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just have to think and listen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Clinton is going to continue the Affordable Care Act is my No. 1 thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie wants to make health care free for all citizens. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cost money. And where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that going to come from? Taxes. So I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I want to do that.

{"Headline": "U.S. Asks Tech and Entertainment Industries Help in Fighting Terrorism", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byObama administration officials met with executives of major technology and entertainment companies in Washington on Wednesday to discuss combating the activities of violent extremists online, according to industry and government officials.The meeting was called by the White House, according to a person who attended and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The session began with government officials admitting their shortcomings in tackling the explosion of activity by terrorist groups online.John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, started the meeting by saying that federal law enforcement had struggled to reach audiences that were responding to recruitment by violent extremists, according to the participant. Nick Rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, lauded some social media platforms for aggressively taking down accounts of suspected terrorists.The hourslong meeting, which took place at the Justice Department, also included speeches by Megan Smith, the national chief technology officer; and Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism.The event was another step toward coordinating government and private sector efforts on national security. After the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., last year, the White House and presidential candidates have pushed for Internet firms to clamp down on the use of social media by extremists to recruit new members, organize and broadcast their demands.Wednesday\u2019s gathering was attended by company executives but few, if any, chief executives. Participants included representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr and Microsoft.Many of the tech companies are willing to work on ways to combat violent extremism on social media. The meeting on Wednesday, called the \u201cMadison Valleywood Project,\u201d in reference to the participation of marketing, tech and entertainment firms, focused on terrorists\u2019 use of social media to organize and recruit members for violent extremism.The subject of encryption and Apple\u2019s resistance to being ordered to break through its encrypted software for law enforcement was not on the agenda.\u201cOver the past year, organizations and companies across a range of industries have asked how they might contribute to efforts to counter radicalization and recruitment activities by ISIL and other violent extremists,\u201d said Marc Raimondi, the Justice Department\u2019s national security spokesman, using a term for the Islamic State.\u201cThe U.S. government recognizes that these private sector actors, which include N.G.O.s, social media companies and content producers, have a crucial role to play in developing creative and effective ways to undermine terrorist recruiting and counter the call to violence,\u201d Mr. Raimondi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byIn Silicon Valley \u2014 if not Washington \u2014 Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud.That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple\u2019s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology.ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \u2014 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed.Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\u2019s cooperation and its resistance is \u201ctechnically able.\u201dIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\u2019s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.That could include iCloud, if Apple can figure out a consumer-friendly way to keep the data under lock and key \u2014 a key Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to use \u2014 without making it inconvenient for people who need to retrieve backups.That is no simple feat. Apple would have to find a way to let users retrieve their own data safely even without the company\u2019s help, while keeping out hackers and other sorts of data thieves.None of this iCloud discussion would apply to iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary text messaging service. It uses technology called end-to-end encryption, which means messages sent using iMessage cannot be intercepted and decrypted. Only the sender and receiver, not Apple, have the keys to read such messages. Apple retains encrypted iMessages on its servers until they are read by the user or expire after several days.For now, the best bet to protect your personal information from snoops may be to keep it off iCloud \u2014 and the many, many apps that may pass or store unencrypted information through data centers. It is safer on your device.Just try not to drop your phone in a swimming pool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philip Knight of Nike to Give $400 Million to Stanford Scholars", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byPhilip H. Knight, the co-founder and chairman of Nike Inc., said on Monday that he had pledged to give Stanford University $400 million to recruit graduate students around the globe to address society\u2019s most intractable problems, including poverty and climate change.The gift to the new Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program, which is modeled on the Rhodes scholarships, matches one of the largest individual donations ever to a university, the $400 million that John A. Paulson, the hedge fund tycoon, gave to Harvard last year to improve its engineering school. The Stanford project is meant to improve the world.\u201cThis is using education to benefit mankind and I think it really could be transformative,\u201d Mr. Knight said in a phone interview. \u201cI jumped on it right away.\u201dIts ambitious mandate is the brainchild of Stanford\u2019s president, John L. Hennessy, a computer scientist and tech entrepreneur, who plans to step down this summer. During his 16-year tenure, Mr. Hennessy nurtured the school\u2019s symbiotic relationship with Silicon Valley and increased Stanford\u2019s endowment to more than $22 billion from about $9 billion in 2000.The program, which will be announced on Wednesday at Stanford, has raised $750 million, making it one of the largest fully funded scholarship endowments in the world.According to the Council for Aid to Education, less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s colleges received 28.7 percent of all gifts in 2015.The former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is now a professor at Stanford, called it \u201can exciting place at the heart of Silicon Valley.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people are innovating all the time and it can attract the best people from all over the world.\u201dMr. Knight, a graduate of Stanford\u2019s business school, gave that institution $105 million in 2006. Over the past 20 years, he has donated hundreds of millions to the University of Oregon, where he received his undergraduate degree.Not every gift pledged by Mr. Knight has gone smoothly. In 2000, he withdrew a $30 million pledge to expand the University of Oregon\u2019s football stadium after the school allied itself with a labor group that was critical of Nike factories overseas. The university president later reversed the decision and Mr. Knight restored the gift.The Knight-Hennessy scholarship is not unique, but Mr. Knight may well be the rare billionaire benefactor who is willing to share top billing. \u201cI think locking my name in with his for decades to come is an honor,\u201d Mr. Knight said.Mr. Hennessy described the fellowships as his legacy. \u201cA few years ago I started to think about the one thing I could do at Stanford that could make a difference for the world in a bigger setting,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWe could bring the best students from around the world to Stanford and produce a string of leaders educated in making positive change.\u201dStarting in 2018, the program will annually offer full tuition and board to 100 students \u2014 a third of them from the United States and two-thirds from abroad \u2014 who will gain admittance to one of Stanford\u2019s seven graduate schools and commit to working on important issues in small, multidisciplinary teams.One problem Mr. Hennessy said he might assign to a team is to analyze the $100 million donation that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, made to Newark public schools in 2010, and that has not been widely seen as a success. \u201cNobody understood the real difficulty in making significant change in the public education system,\u201d Mr. Hennessy said. His scholars would be asked, he added, \u201c \u2018How do you build a structure that will successfully deploy those funds for the benefit of all?\u2019 \u201dMr. Hennessy said he was confident that this money would be well spent. \u201cTo say we can solve all the world\u2019s problems is na\u00efve,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say we can educate people to make a significant difference in trying to solve those problems \u2014 that\u2019s an achievable goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Living With Cancer: A Farewell to Legs", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.On a bright, cold Sunday in mid-January, I returned home from visiting a frail member of my cancer support group and opened the garage to haul the recyclables up the steep driveway to the street. After a few steps, my feet started to slip and I fell with a thud on my bottom. The big bin toppled over me, scattering plastic containers and cardboard boxes, as my hands reached down to feel a sheet of ice that had been invisible on the asphalt.I was about to discover what happens when cancer patients must deal with unrelated physical injuries.After some screams of pointless rage, I realized that my husband \u2014 who was recovering from surgery for a torn tendon \u2014 could not hear me inside the house. So I crawled, using my arms to prop myself up, back into the car where I phoned and directed him to bring his walker to the front door. I managed to steer the car up the driveway, hobble with the walker inside, and collapse onto the blue couch. If I did not move, the throbbing seemed bearable. Since it was late afternoon and my husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s injury rendered him unable to drive me to the hospital, I settled down in the hope that rest would help.But I awoke without the use of my legs. Any pressure was excruciating, so we called a friend for a lift. At the E.R., scans showed three pelvic fractures. I would be unable to get around for quite a few days and then not without a wheelchair or a walker for weeks. Unlike Ernest Hemingway, I did not believe that I would soon feel \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong at the broken places.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Job started kvetching inside my head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLocusts?\u00e2\u0080\u009d How could doctors perform a pelvic operation on a person who had undergone umpteen abdominal surgeries for ovarian cancer? With an ostomy, my innards were not like those of normal people. Might such an operation trigger a recurrence? What if the anti-cancer drug I take daily impedes bone regeneration?When the E.R. doctor explained that in this case the fractures should heal themselves, a wave of relief enveloped me. Her words prompted a series of reflections about disability and cancer.To begin with, I knew that the experience would have been worse, if I had started out disabled and subsequently received a cancer diagnosis. Paradoxically, you need to be agile and sturdy to manage the unrelenting routine of cancer treatments. Only now do I realize how exceptionally difficult it must be for disabled cancer patients to travel repeatedly to the hospital, to undergo operations or infusions or radiation, and to cope with debilitating side effects. I had learned how to negotiate those straits and could imagine the difficulties of adapting them to my altered condition.Back at home, I found myself marooned on the blue couch, unable to reach the bathroom or the bedroom or even sit up without terrible spasms. My attendance at support group meetings would have to cease and I feared that I would never see one of my friends, Carrol, again.Carrol had started on hospice care in October. She remained at home for three months, but then, unexpectedly, she tolerated some food. Confined to her bed and unable to determine where or how quickly metastases were advancing, she did not know how much time she had: another week, a month, or more. Recovery was not in her lexicon.At the close of every visit, we had made our final embraces and goodbyes. A week or two after my fall, I realized that a profound appreciation of her past life and a profound acceptance of her future death stood Carrol in good stead, not a macho determination to battle and beat the disease.Carrol knew that a clinical trial had granted me a precious remission.  On the day I received news of her death, I pondered her decision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 upon learning that her cancer was terminal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to throw herself a Last Chance to Dance party.She had wanted me to relish a reprieve she never received. My unforeseen stay of execution should ground my determination to embrace whatever befalls me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for better or for worse, in sickness and in health \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until that moment when I would arrive at the state she inhabited when I last saw her. Although unwelcome, disability has everything to do with my future life, not my future death.As hydrocodone kicks in and physical therapists teach me how to negotiate without two weight-bearing legs, my temporary immobility shrinks in significance. These professionals try to wean me from an ungainly version of slipping and sliding steps \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something like the Mashed Potato \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that get me from the wheelchair or the walker onto the toilet or the bed.Considering the example of Carrol, I bid farewell to my legs and take up arms against a sea of troubles more negotiable than the miseries with which she had to contend. Doing the Mashed Potato, wincing in pain, graceless under pressure, I hoot to nobody within hearing: the hell with you, Hemingway! I am quarreling with the writer who (to my mind) most brilliantly and foolishly dramatizes the challenges of personal bravery.Later that night, as if conjured, he slides into a chair next to the blue couch, lifts a glass, and breathes the word \u201ccourage.\u201d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complicated matter, we agree, and then we clink.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Crackdowns on Free Speech Rise Across a Europe Wary of Terror", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byAngry parents complained, and the real police stepped in. They arrested two puppeteers, who could now face as much as seven years in prison on charges of glorifying terrorism and promoting hatred.But some civil liberties groups and legal experts are growing increasingly alarmed at the broad ways such laws are being adapted as the specter of Islamic extremism becomes Europe\u2019s new preoccupation.Once such prohibitions become law, even if in response to real security concerns, there is no telling how the statutes could be applied in the future, they say.Last year, however, the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy overhauled and strengthened the law, aiming this time at Islamic terrorism. Among other things, the changes raised the maximum prison sentence for first-time offenders to three years from two to virtually guarantee jail time.\u201cThis is the latest very serious attack on freedom of expression,\u201d said Joaquim Bosch, a spokesman for Judges for Democracy, an association of about 600 judges that focuses on human rights. \u201cDuring the Franco dictatorship, troublesome artists went to prison, but not in democratic Spain.\u201dEven at the height of ETA\u2019s violent campaign, Mr. Bosch noted, the law forbidding the glorification of terrorism was used \u201cabout two or three times a year.\u201dLast year, however, judges from Spain\u2019s national court ruled on 25 such cases, absolving the defendants in only six of them. \u201cThe politicization of terrorism has been used as a smoke screen to deviate attention from social and corruption problems,\u201d Mr. Bosch said.French lawmakers toughened the penalties \u2014 to up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 75,000 euros (about $82,000), or up to seven years and a $110,000 fine if the statements were made online.In the view of the Association of Victims of Terrorism, one of the groups in Spain now pressing charges against the puppeteers, their show amounted to an act of \u201cpraise and recognition for terrorist organizations that have caused so much pain and suffering within our society.\u201dSpain\u2019s interior minister, Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, also defended the use of the law to arrest the puppeteers at a time when \u201cinternational terrorism is threatening our country.\u201dHe condemned the show for including other anti-establishment scenes of violence, including the hanging of a judge and the rape of a nun. \u201cTo pretend that this is satire or dark humor seems to me an absurdity,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz said.But since the arrest of the puppeteers, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez and Alfonso L\u00e1zaro de la Fuente, street protests have been held in their defense around the country.The civic associations that organized a demonstration in Granada, where the puppet company was founded, said that \u201creality supersedes fiction\u201d when artists go to prison for staging a spectacle based on the three-century-old British tradition of Punch and Judy shows, in which puppets were sometimes beaten to death.Far from promoting terrorism, the Madrid show was intended to condemn \u201cthe criminalization of social protest,\u201d the associations said.According to Eric Sanz de Bremond, a lawyer for the puppeteers, the sign during the show was \u201cused as false incriminating evidence, to prove a crime and never to praise terrorism.\u201d A miniature anarchist notebook that was confiscated by the police was also only a stage prop, he said.\u201cThis is a pure work of fiction and satire,\u201d he said, noting that the puppet show had premiered in Granada \u201cwithout any incident\u201d in late January.Inconsistent application, in fact, is one of the dangers of such statutes, said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, a professor of political science at the National University of Distance Education.\u201cI think such laws take us on a dangerous slope toward arbitrariness in a democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem with such a law is that it got drafted in a vague way and there is so little jurisprudence that its application becomes a lottery, dependent on whoever is the judge in the case.\u201dAmbiguity about where exactly the legal line sits can have its own chilling effect in stifling speech, encouraging self-censorship.\u201cWe have passed such laws without first having a proper debate about where free speech should end,\u201d he said, \u201cso that most Spaniards aren\u2019t now aware of the limits that have been placed and how that can play out in the courts.\u201dHow proposed changes to France\u2019s Constitution to fight terrorism compare with laws in other countries.The boundary between terrorism and culture, and the limits of public protest, are being tested in other cases, as well.C\u00e9sar Monta\u00f1a Lehmann, a Spanish singer known as C\u00e9sar Strawberry who leads a rap metal band called Def Con Dos, is awaiting trial on accusations of posting offensive messages on Twitter praising terrorism. A public prosecutor wants him sentenced to 20 months in prison.Aitor Cuervo Taboada, a self-defined revolutionary poet, is set to appear in court on Thursday, facing a possible 18-month sentence for publishing writings that the public prosecution says glorify terrorism by praising ETA and offending its victims.This month, a judge started proceedings to try Mr. Zapata for his \u201ccruel humor\u201d comment about the terrorism victim.Last week, Rita Maestre, the spokeswoman for Madrid\u2019s City Hall, appeared in court after being charged with offending religious feelings during a protest held in a university chapel five years ago.Alongside other protesters, Ms. Maestre, who was a student at the time, lifted her top to reveal her bra, while shouting insults against the Catholic Church.Facing a possible one-year prison sentence, Ms. Maestre told the court that it made no sense for a public university in a secular country to maintain a chapel. She expressed regret for causing offense, but insisted that \u201cprotests, as long as they are pacific, are legitimate.\u201dAs for the puppeteers, they have not given interviews since spending five days in prison this month.In a joint statement, however, they insisted the play was not intended to offend but to \u201ctell a story of fiction that unfortunately has many similarities with the reality that we have had to live these days.\u201dFreedom of speech \u201cisn\u2019t the right to say just what one wants to hear,\u201d the puppeteers argued. \u201cWhoever understands it that way in reality doesn\u2019t believe in it.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

She has built an extensive network of hundreds of contacts across the spectrum, from Syrian government officials and soldiers to members of the Islamic State, plus doctors, businesspeople, teachers and community leaders in government-controlled and insurgent-held areas.At one military conference in Turkey in 2012, just the sound of Ms. Saad\u2019s voice drew scores of fighters who wanted to meet her in person. More recently, social media companies have shut down several of Ms. Saad\u2019s accounts, presumably because she is in touch with too many jihadists.Correspondents loved her doggedness, her enthusiasm, her never-fading humor and her special genius for learning about people\u2019s lives. She started working for The Times in 2008, as an interpreter and news assistant, and now is a crucial member of the team reporting on Syria.She is also an inveterate Internet shopper, which proved serendipitous as the Syrian uprising took hold. Ms. Saad had, for years, spent late nights scrolling through style websites. Suddenly, rebels who fought during the day would see her online after hours and reach out on Skype. These days, she gets hundreds of notifications daily, and conversations often continue until 2 or 3 a.m.\u201cIt is this big wave that engulfs me,\u201d Ms. Saad said. \u201cI go online every day and every night. When you are away from it, you feel deprived.\u201dCombatants confide in her both because they hope to get their story out and because she is the rare woman on the network. They want to hear a motherly voice, and some even flirt. They detail their worries, talk about their wives or girlfriends, wax nostalgic about the food they miss.\u201cYou talk to them in a sweet way, and they are not used to it,\u201d she said.The first two questions young fighters invariably ask are her age and marital status. In the beginning, Ms. Saad allowed to one that she was 30. (Not quite true.)\u201cI have an aunt who is 30 with five kids!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cShould I call you auntie?\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t call me auntie,\u201d Ms. Saad responded, appalled.For years, Ms. Saad \u2014 who resembles the singer Amy Winehouse, but with more unruly black curls and no tattoos \u2014 did not display her picture online, mostly for security reasons. As she has become better known on all sides, she has relaxed the rule.But still, owing to unreliable Internet speeds inside Syria, as well as in Lebanon, a majority of chats do not include video. Instead, Ms. Saad communicates by voice or text, remaining invisible to most of her contacts. As Islamist fighters \u2014 foreign and Syrian \u2014 multiplied in Ms. Saad\u2019s contact list, some wanted to know if she wore a hijab. Others demanded to know her religious views, or urged her to embrace their version of Islam.There are constant, insistent requests: Find me a weapons supplier. Buy me a satellite Internet connection. Marry me.And, more recently: Can you get me a visa? Can you help me get asylum? Do you know any smugglers?Ms. Saad parries them all, emphasizing that she is an observer, not an actor in the conflict.Sometimes, she feels badly about living comfortably in Beirut while her interlocutors are mired in an intractable war, but the hours online are transporting. \u201cYou live through their experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want to be rude to them, ever \u2014 some of them have risked their lives to help me.\u201dAs the war dragged on, contacts died. Some were kidnapped, imprisoned or beheaded. One drifted toward extremism, becoming first a useful source on the Islamic State and then, to Ms. Saad\u2019s horror, a suicide bomber who killed civilians in his hometown.Now, there is a new category of correspondents: the parents, friends and relatives of the dead and disappeared. The mother of one slain activist found Ms. Saad\u2019s information in his phone and calls now and then saying, \u201cI can smell him through you.\u201dFor Ms. Saad, a project that began as \u201csomething fun\u201d \u2014 online chats to supplement reporting on hard-to-reach Syria \u2014 has become a solemn calling to give voice to people mired in conflict, which resonates with her own experience growing up during Lebanon\u2019s civil war.\u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to them,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the last one who\u2019s witnessing what they\u2019re going through. Maybe I\u2019m the last one to pass a message to their families.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cliven Bundy and Sons Charged in Case That Gave Rise to Oregon Standoff", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byDENVER \u2014 They are accused of launching a \u201cmassive armed assault\u201d on federal officials, gaining hundreds of followers by spreading lies on the Internet, and encouraging their supporters to take sniper positions on highway bridges above government agents, unarmed adults and children.A federal grand jury made those allegations Wednesday in an indictment against the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and four other people for a 2014 standoff in which hundreds of his supporters chased off federal agents trying to confiscate his cattle. The incident turned Mr. Bundy into an icon for many who oppose federal power, and set the stage for a more recent showdown in which Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons and followers occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon to protest government control of public land.The charging document named four co-conspirators in the 2014 standoff: Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons, Ammon and Ryan Bundy; a radio host, Peter T. Santilli Jr.; and another member of the so-called patriot movement, Ryan W. Payne. All four were previously charged in the occupation of the refuge. United States Attorney Daniel G. Bogden said the charges reaffirmed the rule of law. \u201cPersons who use force and violence against federal law enforcement officers who are enforcing court orders, and nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others, will be brought to justice,\u201d he said in a statement.Mike Arnold, Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyer, said that his client was innocent until proven guilty, and took issue with parts of the indictment that drew evidence of crimes from Mr. Bundy\u2019s words. \u201cA government indictment means nothing, it proves nothing,\u201d Mr. Arnold said, urging the public to wait on drawing conclusions until the issue is \u201ctaken up by the courts and the jury.\u201dLawyers for the other defendants did not respond to requests for comment.In the indictment, the Justice Department described its version of the April 2014 showdown near Mr. Bundy\u2019s ranch. Starting in 1993, Mr. Bundy refused to pay fees or obtain permits for cattle he grazed on public land. In 2014, when the federal government announced it would confiscate his cattle, Mr. Bundy said publicly that he was \u201cready to do battle\u201d with federal agents and would \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to protect his livestock. The five men recruited followers via emails and videos with names like \u201cRange War,\u201d and invited them to a \u201cpatriots picnic,\u201d by the Bundy ranch. Two years after standoff at Bundy ranch, five are accused of launching a \u201cmassive armed assault\u201d on federal agents.According to the document, the standoff culminated on April 12, 2014, when Mr. Bundy \u201ccommanded\u201d his followers to retake confiscated cattle. More than 400 followers converged on a rural Nevada highway near the impounded cattle, facing about 50 government agents.\u201cUnwilling to risk harm to children and other bystanders who had accompanied the followers, and wishing to avoid what was sure to follow if they engaged the snipers on the bridge who posed such an obvious threat to their lives, the officers had no choice and were forced to leave,\u201d the document read.Mr. Bundy was arrested nearly two years later, on Feb. 10, at the Portland airport. He was on his way to see the last few occupants of the Oregon bird refuge, according to a statement posted on his ranch\u2019s Facebook page.His arrest followed months of speculation over whether he would face charges in the 2014 conflict. But the indictment provides some insight into the federal government\u2019s hesitation: After the standoff, Mr. Bundy began using a crew of armed body guards.\u201cThey think they are in some kind of holy war here \u2014 although they don\u2019t have very much in common with the jihadists, they act like them,\u201d said Mr. Blumm, the law professor.

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byTech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without.So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction.At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel \u201cReady Player One\u201d is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from \u201cStar Trek.\u201dBut how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers.\u201cScience fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,\u201d said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses.Much of the action in the book takes place inside the Oasis, a global virtual reality network. Characters in the network attend school, socialize and take part in a high-stakes treasure hunt. Through virtual reality, they can inhabit the perspectives of actors in classic movies.\u201cOne of the things I like about \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 is all of the depictions in the book are pretty feasible,\u201d Mr. Luckey said. \u201cNone of it is crazy, far-out tech.\u201dOculus gave out 3,000 copies of the book to attendees of an Oculus developer conference last year. For good measure, Oculus named the meeting rooms at its headquarters after famous fictional versions of virtual reality, including the holodeck, the Oasis and the Matrix, from the movie of the same name and, before that, William Gibson\u2019s \u201cNeuromancer.\u201dMr. Cline said he wrote \u201cReady Player One\u201d partly because he could not figure out why virtual reality had not taken off in the real world.But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace \u2014 and often someone \u2014 they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters.In an interview, Mr. Stephenson \u2014 whose title is chief futurist \u2014 declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several \u201ccontent projects\u201d underway at the company.More broadly, Mr. Stephenson said science fiction books and movies are often useful within tech companies for rallying employees around a shared vision.\u201cMy theory is that science fiction can actually have some value in that it gets everyone on the same page without the kind of expensive and tedious process of PowerPoint,\u201d he said. But the influence of the genre within tech companies is \u201csurprising and mysterious to me as well,\u201d he added.There is a regular theme in science fiction that its fans in tech talk less about, though: the dystopian aspects of virtual reality. Addiction, disconnection from relationships in the real world and alienation from the environment are often side effects in narratives about virtual reality. It\u2019s hard to make that into a selling point for the technology.\u201cEntrepreneurs are optimistic and upbeat by nature, which is why I enjoy hanging around with them,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an admirable ability to completely ignore the more dystopian elements you\u2019re talking about and see the cool stuff and positive potential of where it might go.\u201dOf course, authors and moviemakers get to overlook details of their own \u2014 like the tough technological challenges that real tech companies face.\u201cYou never have to reboot the damned thing\u201d in sci-fi books, said Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist who works at Intel and has written about the interplay between technology and science fiction. \u201cThe mechanics are less interesting to most science fiction writers than the experience.\u201dSometimes science fiction plants seeds in the minds of inventors that take years to sprout. The holographic chess game that Chewbacca played on a tabletop aboard the Millennium Falcon was pretty far-out in the 1970s, when Jeri Ellsworth saw it in the original \u201cStar Wars.\u201d It took decades for technology to catch up.In 2013, Ms. Ellsworth\u2019s start-up, CastAR, gave the first public demonstration of the company\u2019s augmented reality glasses, which overlay digital imagery on the user\u2019s view of the real world.\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been dreaming about my entire life,\u201d Ms. Ellsworth said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Really Like to Risk It All in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byBefore Nathalie Miller decided to walk away from Instacart, the grocery delivery start-up now worth more than $2 billion, she made a spreadsheet to analyze how much money she was leaving on the table.She had been Instacart\u2019s 20th employee, managing operations during a period of extremely rapid growth, and the sum could have been huge. She quit anyway. Like many strivers in Silicon Valley, she had a bigger plan: to start her own company that could not only make millions, but also fulfill a mission she believed in.Then, six months later, Ms. Miller discovered that she was pregnant with her first child. A baby wasn\u2019t something she and her husband, Isaak Le, had been planning quite yet, but they were excited. Still, a sliver of doubt began to undercut her confidence about starting her own company. \u201cHow high can I stack the cards against myself \u2014 a pregnant brown woman?\u201d said Ms. Miller, who is of Vietnamese and European descent.Silicon Valley can seem like the land of overnight success. College dropouts show up and become billionaires a few years later. Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire by the time he was 23, and Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp when it was just five years old.But despite their hold on the imagination, these examples aren\u2019t typical. Much more representative are the companies you never hear about because they never get off the ground.In recent months, the fund-raising atmosphere has cooled as venture capitalists react to the poor stock market performance of some public tech companies and question whether the recent fast pace of investment is sustainable. Venture capitalists are making fewer investments at lower valuations.Nonetheless, Silicon Valley keeps seducing people. For those who come, the risk is worth the potential reward \u2014 not just riches, but also the more dreamy belief that tech entrepreneurialism is a force for good. Ms. Miller was not immune.\u201cI want Doxa to exist in the world,\u201d she told me in July, \u201cbecause it will make the world a better place.\u201dMs. Miller, who turns 34 on Sunday, grew up in Berkeley, and after graduating from Harvard, moved to Vietnam. There, she started a microfinance nonprofit, expanding it to 92 employees. When she returned to the United States, she began a doctorate program in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, but was soon drawn into the tech industry.She joined Instacart in 2013, and saw some of tech\u2019s biggest challenges firsthand. In a year, the company grew to 120 employees from 20, and had 4,000 independent contractors. Hiring well at that kind of speed, she found, is hard to get right.Ms. Miller also experienced the challenges of being a woman in tech. One day, a new employee told her that he had ranked the hottest women at the company, and she was No. 1. She reported the comment to managers, and the employee was fired the next day.Though she was satisfied with Instacart\u2019s response, she knew women in many industries faced much worse, and started ruminating about how she could change workplace culture more broadly.That is when she came up with Doxa. The name comes from a Greek term that sociologists use to describe the things that people take for granted but that don\u2019t necessarily have to be that way.The idea was for a site that would collect data about the sorts of things applicants really want to know but don\u2019t ask in job interviews: Do you feel as if co-workers value your opinions? Do people actually take their vacation days? How often do you work nights and weekends? It would offer online personality tests, then use psychometric data to match candidates with employers more effectively. It would make money from companies paying for information about candidates and to post job ads, as they do on LinkedIn. Sam Meder, who had run engineering at a start-up acquired by Pinterest, agreed to start it with her.Ms. Miller thought Doxa could help by offering data that research shows is important to women \u2014 the gender pay gap and the percentage of women on the executive team \u2014 as well as factors like whether women felt they were given credit for their ideas. But first, she needed to raise money.Venture capitalists, who hold the keys to success in Silicon Valley by providing start-up money, are even more likely to be white and male than tech company employees are. Theirs is an insular business. Most investors accept pitches only from entrepreneurs who come through an introduction, and they tend to finance people who have succeeded before, or who remind them of those who did.\u201cAll she had to do before she said that was get on the phone with 10 black men or women and eight or nine would have said, \u2018This is an issue I\u2019ve had to deal with my entire life,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walker said.Ms. Herscher, who has two and a half decades of experience as a software executive, was introduced to Ms. Miller through a colleague and had agreed to become a kind of mentor. Ms. Miller had unveiled Doxa three weeks before. The site had 820 active users, and 300 companies on a waiting list to be included.Now it needed money. Ms. Miller had calculated that $2 million in venture capital would enable her to hire the people she needed and keep the company running for 18 months. But time was tight. She needed to start paying salaries.She had made her pitch to three small, mission-driven funds that wanted to invest in female and minority founders. Ms. Herscher said she should be aiming instead at well-known venture capital firms.\u201cThe thing is, no real investor is going to invest in you because of the mission,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to invest in you if they think you\u2019ll make a lot of money.\u201d\u201cThe feedback we\u2019re getting from the big guns is we\u2019re too small now,\u201d Ms. Miller told her.\u201cThey didn\u2019t wait for Google to have a prototype before they invested,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.The first time they met to discuss Doxa, Ms. Miller had worn jeans and a sleeveless shirt. The look was too unprofessional, Ms. Herscher told her. She should dress like Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer (whose uniform is crew neck, knee-length dresses with cardigans). Ms. Miller said that everyone she had worked with at tech companies wore jeans and T-shirts, and surely no venture capitalist cared if Mark Zuckerberg showed up in a hoodie. Ms. Herscher was uncompromising: Like it or not, the standard is different for women.This time, Ms. Miller wore a dark cardigan over a dark blouse.Ms. Herscher asked if she had been hit on yet by venture capitalists. She hadn\u2019t. Ms. Herscher told her own horror stories \u2014 the investor who slipped his hand under her hair and massaged her neck, the one that rubbed her knee.Ms. Miller was more worried about the investors\u2019 reaction to her pregnancy. She broke the news to Ms. Herscher.After congratulations, they plotted strategy. Wait until the second meeting to mention it, Ms. Herscher said. \u201cThen say: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. And I\u2019m so well organized that my baby\u2019s due on Christmas Day, which will be a slow time. I don\u2019t expect it will faze me at all. I\u2019m married to a man who will be a primary caregiver, and this is no different from investing in a man whose wife is pregnant.\u2019\u201dThen her tone shifted. She wasn\u2019t talking about business anymore.\u201cHaving your first child is just physically hard, emotionally hard,\u201d said Ms. Herscher, who has two children. \u201cI would never discourage you or say you can\u2019t do it, because you absolutely can. Just be very clear why you\u2019re doing it and what price you\u2019re willing to pay, because the price is time with your baby.\u201dAfter the conversation, Ms. Miller talked with her husband, who works in advertising and was then a freelancer, about being the primary parent. He was on board. She figured she would take off a few weeks and get right back to work.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a lot more nuanced and sometimes it\u2019s subconscious,\u201d said Julia Hu, the founder and chief executive of Lark, which makes a health and weight-loss app. \u201cV.C.s are pattern matchers, and they\u2019re just used to seeing men like themselves.\u201dMany women convey confidence and leadership in a different way than men do, she said. As an Asian woman, she said, she was raised to be humble and quiet and felt uncomfortable promoting her skills. \u201cTo try to be who I thought they wanted me to be, which was another Mark Zuckerberg, was actually very difficult for me without feeling inauthentic.\u201dLater, she realized that describing business partnerships she had made, like one to preinstall Lark on new Samsung phones, was a more effective way for her to demonstrate her leadership skills than boasting about herself.People in Silicon Valley say new motherhood is particularly difficult, because competition moves at hyperspeed. Ms. Mayer, for example, felt the need to announce that she would be \u201ctaking limited time away and working throughout\u201d her leave after giving birth to twins late last year.A few weeks later, Ms. Miller was back at Ms. Herscher\u2019s office, practicing her pitch while Ms. Herscher played the part of skeptical venture capitalist.Ms. Miller had been working 70 hours a week managing Doxa, recruiting companies, trying to raise money and working nights with the engineers who had day jobs.Though her pregnancy had been relatively easy \u2014 at one point she vomited on the sidewalk after meeting an investor, and she was down to a single professional-looking dress that was loose enough to hide her growing belly \u2014 she had not told any investors that she was pregnant, though two had obliquely asked if she was planning to have children.Ms. Miller began her practice pitch to Ms. Herscher: \u201cDoxa is a platform to match qualified people to the right companies. Once this platform exists, we\u2019re going to wonder how we ever found jobs before.\u201d She talked about the team and showed a diagram of how the service worked.\u201cAt this point I have no idea if this is important,\u201d Ms. Herscher said. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me there\u2019s a problem but not if it could make money.\u201dThey ran through some more slides, including her go-to-market strategy \u2014 aiming at women in tech.\u201cI\u2019m immediately turned off and lost, because what you\u2019re telling us is you have this fantastic technology and star team, and you\u2019re going to go after this itty-bitty market and a bleeding heart cause,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.Ms. Miller finished her pitch. It needed to be crisper and more confident, Ms. Herscher said: \u201cIt\u2019s an art to speak in bullet points. It takes practice. Sit in the car and say it over and over.\u201d\u201cO.K., wear cardigans, speak in bullet points,\u201d Ms. Miller said.A week later, she met with Ms. Yuan at Cowboy Ventures. Her tone was more confident and her pitch faster, and she had broadened it beyond women in tech. \u201cThe tools can be used by anyone \u2014 the recruiting market is gigantic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people want is not gender-specific, it\u2019s very millennial-specific.\u201dMs. Yuan pushed back. \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent tension in the way we monetize,\u201d she said. Doxa was asking companies to pay to use the service for recruiting while at the same time the site would publish potentially negative employee comments about the companies\u2019 culture.\u201cIt enables companies to be responsive: \u2018Let\u2019s get a maternity policy because we don\u2019t want to be up on your platform without that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Miller said. Smiling, she added, \u201cI love that you\u2019re saying \u2018we.\u2019\u201dBut a few days later, both venture capitalists declined to invest. NEA said Doxa didn\u2019t show enough traction with users yet. Cowboy said it wasn\u2019t clear that Doxa\u2019s technology was different enough from that of other hiring websites.\u201cI really thought it was a good idea,\u201d Ms. Yuan said later. \u201cBut there were really well funded start-ups in this space, and it was hard to tell because it was so early.\u201dMs. Miller told Mr. Meder that she was scaling back her ambitions from raising $2 million and hiring a full team to raising $500,000 for just the two of them. But things had changed for him. He had been given more responsibility at his day job, and it didn\u2019t feel fair to leave for Doxa, with its uncertain prospects.Ms. Miller canceled her coming pitches and told potential investors that Doxa was on pause. She had talked to more than 40 venture capitalists. But without her co-founder, who was building the technology while Ms. Miller built the business, venture capitalists were unlikely to provide financing.The flip side of overnight success in Silicon Valley is overnight failure. Start-ups can be so dependent on a single investor or partnership that a turn of events can change their fates.In 2011, Jason Shen helped found a start-up called Ridejoy, for connecting people who were driving long distances. For a time, it seemed as if it had the golden touch \u2014 entry into Y Combinator, $1.3 million in venture capital and traffic pouring in from Craigslist, where it posted its services. Vanity Fair did a photo shoot with the founders, and a writer profiled them for a book.Then, Craigslist sent a cease-and-desist letter, forbidding Ridejoy to post on the site. By the time Vanity Fair came out, Ridejoy had laid off nearly all its employees and stopped working on the site.\u201cNow I see companies who raised $10 million, and I\u2019m like, did we just not have guts? Did we just not follow through? Did we just not believe in our thing enough?\u201d said Mr. Shen, who now works at Etsy. \u201cFunding is such a confidence game.\u201dHe is saving his money to try to play the game again.As her baby\u2019s Christmas due date neared and she approached a year of living off savings, Ms. Miller began to get an unfamiliar feeling: the desire for stability.A couple of months later, Code 2040 offered Ms. Miller a full-time job, as the director of partner programs. She accepted. Building a new business focused on diversity fulfilled some of the hopes she\u2019d had for Doxa. She imagined keeping Doxa alive as a side project, once she had more time.Ms. Miller\u2019s plan was to take a month off and get back to work. Then, right on time, on Christmas Day, she gave birth to a girl, Zadie Mai, and changed her mind. The baby took over her thoughts. \u201cI feel a mixture of intense love and protectiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hang out with the baby forever. There are my real physical needs and the physical dependence of the baby, all this stuff I didn\u2019t expect to be so consuming.\u201dShe said she had an entirely new perspective on how undervalued caregivers are, and how people judge women for taking time off work for their families.She decided to take at least six months off, doing some work from home after three or four months, and Code 2040 agreed. Her husband, meanwhile, had found a full-time job in advertising.Ms. Miller said the transition from start-up founder to employee and mother had given her a new perspective on success in Silicon Valley and, more broadly, on what her generation wanted from work, something she wanted to address in her new job.\u201cI wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI knew when I quit Instacart that going on this entrepreneurial journey wouldn\u2019t be like \u2018The Social Network.\u2019 \u201d\u201cBut for me, this was a lesson that it\u2019s not always a straight shot from idea to financing to taking over Silicon Valley and taking over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this was just a lesson that being entrepreneurial and taking risks and jumping into new things you\u2019re excited about sometimes is not linear at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Escalates Rhetoric Before South Carolina Primary", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Donald J. Trump, whose presidential campaign has doused the Republican Party with the verbal equivalent of napalm, has escalated his rhetoric to new levels of intensity before the crucial South Carolina primary this week. It is a vote that, if he wins, could erode the prospects of Republican leaders\u2019 stopping his candidacy.But Mr. Trump did not stop there: He shredded Mr. Bush as a poor leader who let the World Trade Center come down during his watch. In the process, Mr. Trump both challenged Republican orthodoxy and picked at old, sensitive scabs within the party over the war, all in the final days of the primary campaign in a military-heavy state that has been instrumental to the success of the most dominant family in Republican politics for the last 25 years.However late he began doing it, Jeb Bush has been the only candidate who has consistently taken on Mr. Trump. In a Sunday afternoon email to supporters, Mr. Bush pressed the case he\u2019ll make over the next week. The subject line said, \u201cDonald crossed a line.\u201dIn a round of interviews and on the Sunday morning programs, Mr. Trump, who has spent the entire campaign defying predictions that his comments would come back to bite him, responded to questions about his comments in the debate with an across-the-board \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He dismissed complaints that he had gone too far, or that his remarks could hurt him in a state where the former president remains highly popular.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it does, it does \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have to tell the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times.\u201cI could be very quiet,\u201d he added. \u201cI could say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u2019 or I could say, \u2018Excuse me, the World Trade Center'\u201d came down during Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure.Mr. Trump headed into the final week in South Carolina with a crescendo of orthodoxy-challenging pronouncements, including criticism of the home-state Senator Lindsey Graham. He also defended his previous comments about the work of Planned Parenthood, saying during the debate, when challenged by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, that he did not approve of abortion but that the organization did \u201cwonderful work\u201d for women\u2019s health more broadly. That remark could be toxic for Republican primary voters; it had made its way into an ad from Mr. Cruz by late Sunday afternoon.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the former president overshadowed those about Planned Parenthood. But even some former advisers to George Bush did not believe that the remarks about the Iraq war and the World Trade Center would do much damage to Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOverwhelmingly, most Republicans disagree with his criticisms of George W. Bush, but most Republicans also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to debate\u201d Mr. Bush\u2019s legacy, said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2004 campaign.Most people share Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view that the war was a mistake, Mr. Schmidt added, and in a state heavy with military members, many families have grown weary of repeated deployments.Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who advised Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign, also saw little peril for Mr. Trump, even if one of his opponents puts the remark into a television or radio ad.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could potentially bring down his margin, but when you\u2019ve got a guy who wins by double digits, does it matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fabrizio said.For Mr. Trump, standing by even his contentious comments has been a hallmark of his appeal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the electorate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been responding to is strength,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schmidt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Trump once again last night showed what many Republican voters will regard as strength.\u201dMore problematic for Mr. Trump, Mr. Fabrizio said, could be his Planned Parenthood comments.Mr. Trump made noises before the Iowa caucuses about being a \u00e2\u0080\u009chealer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and aligning with the Republican establishment. In a crucial debate in New Hampshire, his approach was to avoid torching his opponents for the most part. But when he had a dust-up with Mr. Bush during the final debate in New Hampshire and the audience booed Mr. Trump, he made the most of it, saying they were against him because they were major donors and he could not be controlled.He has since used that line repeatedly on the campaign trail, even singling out Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finance chairman, the billionaire Woody Johnson, as an example of the type of donor who is working against Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 never mind that Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson are actually friends.When the crowd at the South Carolina debate on Saturday night also began to boo, Mr. Trump again sought to use it to his advantage, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only tell the truth, lobbyists!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At another point, he criticized Mr. Graham for polling poorly in his presidential race. And he said Mr. Cruz was \u201cthe single biggest liar\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something that would have been seen as indecorous in previous campaigns, but that channels the anger voters feel toward elected officials.That coarsening of the language in the campaign, Mr. Schmidt argued, reflects the toxic culture of social media, and such behavior is no longer considered as much of a risk.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about both George Bush and Planned Parenthood are likely to stick to him well beyond the vote in South Carolina, in other primaries. But as for South Carolina, even those who would like to see him disappear from the race struggled to suggest that, after so many predictions of his demise, his latest comment would be the one to prove debilitating. While his margin of victory might be diminished, some operatives suggested, as long as there are multiple candidates, Mr. Trump will continue to amass delegates and roll toward the convention in Cleveland.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccusing President Bush of lying about the war adds to the hard cap of Trump\u2019s ceiling,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist and a supporter of Jeb Bush. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it matters until this is a two-man or three-man race.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTrygve Olson, who also advised Mr. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cConventional wisdom would say Trump should end up paying a high price for his thermonuclear gambit on the debate stage, his attack on President Bush and his positions that are totally incongruent with the vast majority of conservative voters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he was reluctant to embrace that wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI personally think he will pay a price,\u201d Mr. Olson said, \u201cbut given how this cycle is unfolding with regards to Trump, the reality is it is difficult, if not impossible, to say that will be the case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Clyburn plans to endorse Hillary Clinton for president on Friday, giving her campaign a powerful seal of approval from one of the most influential Democrats in South Carolina and the leading black politician in the state.Mr. Clyburn is expected to announce his support for Mrs. Clinton during a news conference at Allen University in Columbia, according to a person close to Mr. Clyburn with knowledge of his plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Mr. Clyburn, who is a member of the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives and the lone Democrat elected to Congress from South Carolina, has long been a sought-after power broker in presidential primary campaigns. He stayed neutral in the 2008 presidential primary, opening a rift that year between him and the Clintons.

Jesse Jackson\u2019s 20 years before, a remark that offended many African-Americans. Mr. Clyburn\u2019s support for Mrs. Clinton now, at such a key time in her campaign, is a sign that her and Mr. Clinton\u2019s efforts at reconciling with Mr. Clyburn yielded results.His endorsement this year comes at a particularly important moment, as Mrs. Clinton makes an all-out push for black voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support in her primary battle with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mrs. Clinton has held a strong lead in the polls here, largely because of the strength of her support in South Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black communities.

{"Headline": "Falling Asleep to Grenades: Mexicans Tell Pope How They Live", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byA young mother living in one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states said she had gone to sleep with the sound of grenades and guns outside her home. Another woman, in Mexico City, wrote that kidnappings had become so commonplace, they are spoken of like the weather. Many others complained about living under a corrupt government.Here is a selection, edited and condensed for clarity:Out of view: corruption, bad infrastructureThe pope should know that the Mexico he will be shown is NOT the real Mexico. He will not see the corruption, insecurity and bad infrastructure. Mexico is certainly in no position to squander the amount of money it is spending on his visit.Missing the old daysI would like Pope Francis to know that we\u2019re missing the old days. Those days when we could go out and play outside. Those days were real, they were safe.Our children don\u2019t know what it is to go out and not worry about the insecurity and kidnapping and everything that should not be happening in our Mexico. Our children think as adults and their childhood is being stolen, and it\u2019s sad to see them worry about things we didn\u2019t even worry about when we were 6 years old.But we will still welcome you because Mexicans have warm hearts, and we like pretending that nothing bad is going on around us.Corruption and insecurityI think the pope should know (if he doesn\u2019t already) that we are sick of living with the high levels of corruption and insecurity. We are also tired of having to pay for stupid expenses made by our government, like the pope\u2019s visit.Raising a baby amid violenceI live in one of the most violent states in Mexico with my husband and my baby daughter. I\u2019ve seen decapitated people on my way to college, I\u2019ve gone to sleep with the sound of grenades and AK-47s, and I have had to lie on the floor during a shooting.Where kidnappings are commonplaceI would like the pope to know that the kidnapping and dismemberment of people is so commonplace, the neighbors talk about it like they do the weather.I hope I don\u2019t get kidnapped for speaking out.Mr. Pope, to say what you feel here gets you murdered or desaparecido. How is it we can\u2019t find the missing 43 students from Iguala yet? LIFE IS BEYOND NORMAL HERE. HELP!A government distractionThe pope was invited to the country just as a strategy to calm down the people\u2019s general anger about many issues (e.g. economy, violence, poverty and insecurity).This man (the pope) is not a fool and knows perfectly the kind of country he is going to find, and the kind of politicians he is going to meet, but he is going to act with his natural diplomacy. Nothing, nothing will change.Millions of Mexicans don\u2019t really want him to visit, and we have actually nothing against him as a person or as a spiritual leader, but against the \u201copportunity\u201d that our authorities found by planning this event.Multiple realitiesThe pope should know and realize that in Mexico City there are several realities. If you are lucky, you can have a great life full of beautiful experiences, but if you are not, you are one of the thousands trying to survive every day\u2026A hunger for knowledge and foodThe pope should know that Mexico is the most dangerous country for a woman, that our government is the biggest circus in the world, that here in Mexico slavery exists in many forms, that our children receive a poor education, they have hunger for knowledge and real hungry too; this is the most beautiful country and we have fear of living here.Hope, courage and faith lives onI think the pope should know that in Mexico there are still young people with hope, courage and above all with faith in the midst of a society distorted by so much corruption.Sick and tired of our governmentUs Mexicans are so sick and tired of our government and their antics that we now think ill of everything that might look like an event to appease the masses.Young people losing faithThe pope should know that he\u2019s arriving to a Mexico where Catholicism is not as strong as it was before. Young people are losing our \u2018faith\u2019 in the Catholic Church, because of corruption and situations like pederasty among priests.Be our voiceA war zone in Mexico, where we daily live in fear of being robbed, kidnapped, or killed. I would like him to speak up for us, the people who are being silenced by fear. He has the power to tell the truth of the depth of the corruption in our government and how that has led to years of horror in this country.I would like him to come not as a representative of the Vatican, but as the representative of God on earth, and bring truth and hope.We Mexicans need you, Pope Francisco!Anger over cost of tripIf he truly preaches peace, poverty, etc., wouldn\u2019t the country benefit more by building schools, hospitals or just feeding the innumerable poor? Why must our taxes pay for what a lot of us frankly see as a waste and a terrible inconvenience?I, like most Mexicans, was raised a Catholic, but it is impossible for me to welcome him.We stand with the ChurchWe are a very faithful nation and even though many things are changing in our country, mostly for bad, the majority of us stand up with the church and defend life and human dignity.Looking for spirituality elsewherePope should know that Mexicans are very much disappointed with the Catholic Church. The arrogance (and stupidity) of the bishops, the nearness of the church with caciques, narcos and all kinds of harmful people and, above all, the silence of the Catholic hierarchy regarding child abuse.People are looking for spirituality in other places.A country that belongs to the drug warThe pope should know that Mexico is not a country that belongs to spirituality. Mexico is a country that now belongs mostly to the drug war and anything to do with it. It\u2019s a place where both women and men now do what they can to survive even against their moral convictions.He should be honest and tell the people that the church won\u2019t save them, that it can be a guiding light to the individual becoming the best version of his/herself. But that we must look inside to find godliness and we must start to be brave and stand against corruption, against journalists kidnapped and murdered by corrupt officials, against university students disappeared and never heard from again.He should know that a country such as this with such a rich and beautiful culture deserves better. Its average citizen deserves a greater chance at stability, security, joy, and freedom.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie of New Jersey are locked in an increasingly bitter fight in New Hampshire. Both men have anchored their presidential campaigns in the state, holding dozens of town hall meetings and spending most of their money in an effort to seize momentum here.The latest round of campaign finance filings revealed just how high the stakes are in New Hampshire for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie. Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign reported that it had only $1.1 million in the bank at the start of January. Mr. Kasich fared a bit better, with $2.5 million in reserve.Without a standout performance in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, it may rapidly become difficult for either governor to pay for the fundamentals of campaigning in the next round of elections in South Carolina and Nevada, and beyond.Neither Mr. Kasich nor Mr. Christie is expected to fare well Monday night in the Iowa caucuses, a contest they have both effectively bypassed as Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have dominated the campaign in that first voting state.In New Hampshire, Mr. Trump has held a wide lead over a pack of opponents in every public poll, with no clear second-place favorite.Mr. Christie said in appearances on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Morning America\u00e2\u0080\u009d and MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Joe\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Monday that his goal was to emerge from the first two states as the leading candidate among the governors in the race \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mr. Kasich and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who we beat, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind us, that matters the most,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said on MSNBC.Two other candidates embraced by the political establishment have invested significant resources in New Hampshire: Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But they have enough financial power arrayed behind them to persist in the race even after an unimpressive New Hampshire finish.While both Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have looked to New Hampshire as an opportunity to gain steam in the campaign, they have both also laid the groundwork for a longer fight, spending time and money in South Carolina, Nevada and other states, where Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie have not focused their attention.Mr. Rubio finished last month with $10.4 million in the bank, and a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting his campaign had about $14 million more. Mr. Bush had $7.6 million on hand and his super PAC had almost $59 million stockpiled.Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich also have super PACs supporting them, and may be relying on a strong New Hampshire finish to draw new, large donations into these outside groups.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Gabrielle Giffords Joins Hillary Clinton in South Carolina to Pay Tribute to Victims of Gun Violence", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A plainly confident Hillary Clinton returned to South Carolina on Tuesday night for the first time since her victory in the Nevada caucuses and paid tribute to victims of gun violence and police misconduct as she campaigned before the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic primary.In a break with her monthslong strategy against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton did not criticize her rival or even refer to him obliquely as she reiterated her call for tougher gun laws, an issue that she usually uses to attack Mr. Sanders. She also spoke less about herself or her political needs than about the women who joined her in the church sanctuary: the mothers of the Black Lives Matter movement and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was nearly killed in a 2011 shooting and spoke haltingly and powerfully about her support for Mrs. Clinton.As she heads into a series of Southern primaries that are likely to benefit her more than Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton spoke forcefully about empathy for African-Americans who face disproportionately harsh treatment from the police and often begin their lives in poor school districts and lacking other advantages.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhite Americans, we need to do a better job when African-Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers they face every single day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume our experiences are everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat exhortation has recently become a central part of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stump speech as she courts black voters and tries to infuse her political message with more personal texture, such as emphasizing gratitude and humility. She has talked about those values in her own life, mainly in the context of her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult upbringing. As she faced a growing political threat from Mr. Sanders, who has inspired voters with his denunciations of a \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged\u00e2\u0080\u009d economic and political system, she reshaped her political message to try to inspire voters herself by espousing empathy and presenting herself as a problem-solver for strained or suffering Americans.Introducing the women on stage and sharing the stories about the loss of their children, Mrs. Clinton drew an \u00e2\u0080\u009camen\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the racially mixed audience as she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too many deaths. Too many lives cut short.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne by one, the mothers described their relationships to Mrs. Clinton in strongly personal terms, saying that she showered attention on them when they were deep in grief and continued to check in on them as they turned their mourning into a movement, as one of them put it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI endorse her because she endorsed us first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 on Staten Island after New York City police officers put him in a chokehold after questioning him about selling loose cigarettes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not angry enough to riot \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m angry enough to vote for this lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of Sandra Bland, who died while in police custody in Texas last year after being pulled over for a traffic violation.Ms. Reed-Veal drew laughter after she noted that Mrs. Clinton had not put the mothers up to campaigning for her in South Carolina this week.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no payments being made, there are no secret emails about this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Reed-Veal said, perhaps inadvertently reminding people about the controversy over Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of a private email server as secretary of state.Ms. Giffords, the last to address the audience, drew a standing ovation as she called Mrs. Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u009ccourageous\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said she would \u00e2\u0080\u009cstand up to the gun lobby\u00e2\u0080\u009d as president.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeaking is difficult for me, but come January, I want to say these two words: madam president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Giffords said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "What 5G Will Mean for You", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byBitsYou may soon start hearing a lot about 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless technology. This technology is expected to leap ahead of current wireless technology, known as 4G, by offering mobile Internet speeds that will let people download entire movies within seconds, and it may pave the way for new types of mobile applications.That isn\u2019t stopping operators like Verizon Wireless and telecom equipment makers like Ericsson from pushing ahead with 5G trials.A takeaway from these demo projects may be how companies are increasingly focused on three main areas that they think will underpin 5G networks whenever global standards are completed. Here\u2019s a primer on what those areas are and what 5G could mean for you.Most mobile networks are already pretty fast, often reaching download speeds of more than 15 megabits per second. That lets smartphone users stream songs from Spotify, watch videos on YouTube or quickly check Facebook messages. Under plans for 5G, carriers will most likely offer mobile Internet speeds of more than 10 gigabits per second, or roughly 100 times faster than current networks (and significantly quicker than existing broadband). That would allow you to download high-definition movies almost instantaneously, even if you\u2019re on the go.According to global tech and telecom companies that are spending billions of dollars, combined, on the new wireless technology:\u25a0 With 5G, downloading feature-length movies could take less than five seconds.\u25a0 With 4G, downloading feature-length movies could take as long as eight minutes.Such technology will not come cheap. Carriers and telecom equipment makers will have to install new hardware like cellphone towers in rural areas and tiny mobile hot spots in dense urban areas to reach the 10 gigabits per second target. They will also have to increasingly rely on sophisticated software to manage the expected exponential jump in mobile data traffic. So just as most people\u2019s cellphone bills have risen as they watch more videos and access other entertainment on their mobile devices, expect operators to charge a hefty premium for these new ultrafast services.5G is not just about speed. Companies are also preparing for millions of new wireless devices \u2014 such as smartwatches and other wearable items, as well as sensors embedded in industrial products \u2014 to be connected to the next generation of cellphone networks.These devices will not use a lot of data (a sensor built into a highway, for instance, will need to send only small amounts of digital information across the network every couple of hours). But when combined, these hundreds of millions \u2014 potentially billions \u2014 of new sensors will require almost universal connectivity, or the ability to go online no matter where they are, forcing operators to extend their networks to practically every corner of a country.These devices will potentially be an important new revenue stream for carriers worldwide. Many operators, particularly in Europe, are finding it tough to charge customers more for their increased use of mobile data. But if carriers can persuade businesses in industries like health care as well as industrial conglomerates like General Electric to sign up for new mobile Internet services that connect tiny sensors to the Internet, then operators may have stumbled onto a new way of making money.If 5G can offer ultrafast mobile Internet speeds, then why should you care about how quickly one device can communicate with another? In short, you shouldn\u2019t. And as current mobile networks offer so-called latency, or digital response times, of around 50 to 80 milliseconds (the time it takes for a web page to load on your smartphone), reducing that speed to a mere millisecond \u2014 the goal under most companies\u2019 5G plans \u2014 might not add much to users\u2019 mobile experiences.Yet that extremely fast response time will be essential for many of the new services that will most likely be offered on 5G networks. A prime example is driverless cars. These machines will have to communicate almost in real time with everything around them to avoid cyclists and other obstacles. That can happen only if carriers offer one-millisecond latency, something that may become a lifesaver if autonomous cars become a reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Day Until Super Tuesday, When Some Clarity (Maybe) Moves In", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "A raucous Republican race could gain clarity this week, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont could face a dwindling opportunity to prove he can develop support beyond his coalition of younger, whiter voters, as the parallel primaries head into Super Tuesday. With roughly a dozen nominating contests in both primaries, the Republican votes present an opportunity for Donald J. Trump to amass a plurality of the 595 delegates available, and to put that much more distance between him and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Cruz is fighting to win his home state of Texas, which votes on Tuesday, while Mr. Rubio is looking to increase his vote totals in congressional districts and to bolster his delegate count. But it also appears that those in the Republican Party who do not back Mr. Trump are realizing that he could be their problem through the fall. And in the last two days, Mr. Trump has given his opponents a lot of ammunition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by initially refusing to disavow support from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who has praised Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ascent in the primaries, and by retweeting a famous quote from Mussolini. Mr. Trump has proved Teflon-like in the campaign so far. But he is now facing the first sustained attacks in the form of television advertisements, and he is doing little to counter them with his own spending. And Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz are unloading their opposition research files, including mentions that Mr. Trump avoided the military draft as a younger man and that some news accounts have claimed his businesses had reported ties to organized crime. But the biggest charge that Mr. Rubio hopes will stick is the one in which he has called Mr. Trump a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccon man\u00e2\u0080\u009d over and over. With lesser schoolyard taunts, like discussing the size of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers, he is trying to get in the real estate billionaire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.As for the Democrats, Mr. Sanders is looking to rebound after a deeply lopsided loss to Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina primary, where more than half the voters were African-American. Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly won black voters.

{"Headline": "The Irrationality of Natural Life Sentences", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been teaching philosophy for 15 years, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some very memorable experiences along the way, I knew early on that my current seminar would be unique. The course itself is on values, and each Monday for nearly three hours my students debate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in an often lively and engaging manner \u00e2\u0080\u0094 issues ranging from the existence of universal moral truths to the permissibility of torture and the death penalty. In fact, a few weeks ago, there was a complaint about the level of noise coming from my classroom. The reason for the noise? The utilitarians were rather loudly arguing to the Kantians that sacrificing one of their classmates to prevent the Paris attacks would clearly have been justified.The complaint resulted in a guard being stationed in the doorway of my classroom to ensure that there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009ca security threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d followed by some breath-holding as I waited to see if I would, once again, be removed from the building. You see, the course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m teaching is at Stateville Correctional Center \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a maximum-security men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prison in a suburb of Chicago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where raised voices aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically the result of intense philosophical debate about normative ethical theories. Yet, the room felt no more in need of a guard than do my classes at Northwestern.In other respects, however, this is not at all surprising. The most obvious is that some end up at Stateville for reasons that are disconnected from culpability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 coerced confessions, poor counsel, a racist jury, and so on. But even where these external forces are largely absent, the fact that my classroom seems indistinguishable from those at an elite university turns out not to be that shocking. And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the simple, yet crucially important reason: People can change, often in profoundly transformative ways.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Many types of arguments have been leveled against natural life sentences. Economic ones focus on the ballooning costs of mass incarceration and the toll this takes on government budgets, especially as the age and medical expenses of prisoners rapidly increase. Legal ones ask whether such sentences are cruel and unusual and therefore violate the Eighth Amendment, particularly for juveniles. Social arguments ask whether natural life sentences discourage reform by providing no incentive for rehabilitation. Moral concerns are grounded in the dignity and rights of prisoners, while psychological objections call attention to the myriad causes of deviant behavior and their responsiveness to appropriate treatment.In any other domain, it would obviously be irrational to make a high-stakes decision about the rest of another person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life that not only rules out the possibility of ever considering additional evidence, but is also meant to be absolutely final.Of course, when punishment is connected with rehabilitation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undeniable that information about changes, especially among prisoners, is relevant. But this is also true for all but the crudest forms of retributive justice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a commonplace that information about a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental states bears on the punishment deserved, regardless of its consequences. When considering punishments, including at parole hearings, we are often highly sensitive to whether the wrongdoer appreciates the wrongness of the act, feels remorse, and is committed to not being a repeat offender.Compare two students known to have cheated: The first fully acknowledges that looking at her notes during an exam was wrong, is clearly contrite, and promises to never do so again; the second flagrantly and steadfastly lies about it and shows no evidence that he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cheat again. It is fairly standard for the second student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s punishment to be harsher than the first\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.But if we take two students with such different mental states regarding cheating as deserving of different sanctions, why would we not regard two stages of the same person \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one at 19 and another at 49 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with radically different attitudes toward his crime, as deserving of different punishments? Current selves and future selves can vary from one another no less than two altogether distinct people do.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Notice that nothing in the epistemic argument here suggests that no prisoners should, in fact, spend the rest of their natural lives behind bars. Instead, the point is that rationality requires that we leave the epistemic door open to acquiring new information. Put bluntly, the argument says that it is irrational for the possibility of parole to be taken off the table at the outset of any sentence.If Hume is right that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca wise man proportions his belief to the evidence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then our beliefs about the punishment a person deserves at any given time need to be sensitive to the evidence available at that time. But if we screen off huge amounts of potentially relevant information decades before the beliefs about what a prisoner deserves are even formed, then it is impossible for them to be proportioned to the evidence.Nearly all of my students at Stateville are serving natural life sentences. At least a handful of them have been incarcerated since they were teenagers, one since he was 14. While I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any of their decades-earlier selves, their current selves are some of the most extraordinary students I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in my 15 years of teaching. They are painters and poets, mentors and authors, researchers and advocates. They breathe new life into philosophical questions I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been asking for the entirety of my career. And yet we tell these men that who they are now and what they have accomplished matters so little to how they ought to be treated that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to consider it. Rationality demands that we do better.Jennifer Lackey is a professor philosophy at Northwestern University.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Vacancy Has Left and Right Ready to Pounce", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s senior adviser and his top lawyer were blunt with liberal activists on a strategy call as they jumped into what political professionals in Washington expect to be one of the hardest-fought Supreme Court battles in a generation. The White House hardly needed to prod the interest groups during the Tuesday call. The outcome of this battle could determine the fate of a vast array of contentious issues for decades to come: immigration, climate change, gun rights, campaign finance, health care, affirmative action, gay rights and abortion.So in record time, the liberal and conservative Washington lobbying and advocacy machines have roared to life as both sides prepare for a fight on a battlefield that includes the White House, Congress and the campaign trail. Advocacy groups are vowing to spend millions of dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the entire progressive movement up against the entire conservative movement,\u201d said Frank Sharry, an immigration activist whose organization was represented in Tuesday\u2019s White House call. \u201cI do think it\u2019s going to be a battle of a different order.\u201dSince 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.On Wednesday, White House officials responded to Republican accusations of hypocrisy by Mr. Obama, who voted to filibuster President George W. Bush\u2019s nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the court. Mr. Obama, who is now demanding a quick hearing and vote for his next nominee, regrets that vote, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Mr. Earnest said the president did not believe Democrats should have been \u201clooking for an opportunity to throw sand in the gears.\u201dThat admission is unlikely to satisfy conservatives. Like their liberal counterparts, the leaders of conservative groups have jumped to reorder their priorities as they begin dividing up the tasks: raising money, lobbying senators, firing up constituents, planning radio and television ads, writing letters to editors and creating talking points for television appearances.Moments after Justice Scalia\u2019s death became public, the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative organization, organized a team of five lawyers to scour the backgrounds of potential nominees, and another team to research the Senate\u2019s procedural rules. The group has so far sent out a million emails to its members and is preparing videos to post on its Facebook page early next week.\u201cThe stakes are as high as anything we have dealt with in Washington in a decade,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel for the law center. \u201cThis is not even the beginning of what this fight will be. It\u2019s full-media, full-legal research, full-government affairs, full-throttle on this.\u201d\u201cScalia was only dead a couple of hours when the rhetoric was already heated,\u201d Mr. Levey said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we avoid a Borkian experience.\u201dIn an election year, action often shifts away from Washington\u2019s K Street lobbying corridor to the campaign headquarters for presidential candidates. But that changed instantly with the prospect that a sitting Democratic president could deliver a liberal Supreme Court majority by replacing the court\u2019s leading conservative voice.Mr. Obama\u2019s adversaries are determined to stop that from happening, and the stakes are just as high for his supporters.The players are familiar: On the left, the court campaign will be run by groups like the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Alliance for Justice, American Bridge, Americans United for Change, People for the American Way and labor unions. On the right, FreedomWorks, the Judicial Crisis Network, the Family Research Council and the American Center for Law and Justice have begun to take up the fight.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.The struggle to shape the court\u2019s future is also drawing combatants from groups that have not typically played central roles in Supreme Court fights. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, which sees the court\u2019s outlook on environmental issues as critical, has begun calling and emailing its 1.5 million members, asking them to reach out to their senators and urge them to confirm Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee this year.\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important that the president nominate someone and the Senate acts,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, the president of the league. \u201cWe will be more engaged in this effort than we ever have before in a Supreme Court nomination. We\u2019ll urge our members to create pressure on the Senate. We want to make sure that message is heard loudly and clearly.\u201dBoth sides agree that the battle will be long, with many advocates using words like \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cmonumental\u201d to describe it. They also say it will play out in at least three distinct phases, the first of which is underway.Phase 1 will last for the next several weeks, activists on both sides say, and will continue until Mr. Obama announces a nominee. During this phase, the sides will focus on establishing a process that works to their benefit.Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and supported by the outside groups, will make the case that a nomination should be made by the next president, not Mr. Obama. The president\u2019s coalition will argue that the process should move forward this year.A three-page document of talking points distributed to the progressive groups after the White House call on Tuesday suggested lines like \u201cin America, we have one president at a time\u201d and \u201cthere is plenty of time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility to give the president\u2019s nominee a fair hearing and timely vote.\u201dPhase 2 will begin the moment the president announces his pick. At that point, the arguments over procedure are likely to give way to an intense focus on the nominee.On the conference call, the liberal groups were urged to stick together once a nominee is announced, to defer to the president and to coalesce behind his pick. But there is already some evidence that not all groups will view Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee through the same lens.Some environmental organizations are expressing concerns about one possible candidate, Sri Srinivasan, an appeals court judge who cleared the Senate with a 97-to-0 vote. As a corporate lawyer, he defended Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, the energy company that went bankrupt after an accounting and fraud scandal. He also represented Exxon Mobil after a human rights group sued the company, accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses committed by state security forces that protect a large natural gas field in Indonesia.\u201cWe think that any potential Supreme Court nominee that has clear ties to big oil and clear ties to two of the worst companies \u2014 Enron and Exxon \u2014 given the issues of climate change and other environmental safety issues that are percolating would be one of the worst picks,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, the head of Bold Nebraska, a group that has lobbied against the Keystone XL oil pipeline.Phase 3 will probably begin in earnest after the Republican and Democratic Parties pick their nominees this summer and the fall campaign begins.\u201cThis is a monumental fight,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cIt will be the biggest political fight of the year. It will be huge.\u201dCoral Davenport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On the campaign trail, he has invoked Mr. Sessions repeatedly as a partner in stifling immigration legislation in 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an episode that is central to Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument against Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issue.On Sunday, as news of the endorsement trickled out, Mr. Cruz, who had publicly wooed Mr. Sessions, declined to weigh in.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait to comment on endorsements until they actually happen rather than to comment on speculation of endorsements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters in Oklahoma City. Both Mr. Rubio and Mr. Sessions discussed securing the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders and immigration in their remarks, and the endorsement also highlights the weakness of Senator Marco Rubio, who was a co-author of the controversial Senate bill, with the Republican base just two days before voters head to the polls in a string of conservative Southern states.The news also serves as a boost to Mr. Trump as he is coming under the most sustained paid media assault of his candidacy, and as he has made a series of stumbles, including declining to denounce support from David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and to disavow a quote from Benito Mussolini that he promoted on his Twitter account.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Transgender Patients Face Challenges at the Hospital", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "After a skiing accident in January left him with a smashed knee, Beck Bailey, a transgender man in Greenfield, Mass., spent 15 days in a Vermont hospital undergoing a handful of surgeries. As part of his normal routine, Mr. Bailey gives himself regular shots of testosterone. But the endocrinologist on duty in Vermont told him that patients should not take testosterone post surgery.Mr. Bailey explained that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just stop his hormone treatment. But the doctors were so resistant that he finally had them call his primary care physician, who explained he should resume his usual protocol.Mr. Bailey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience is echoed by many transgender patients, both those who have fully transitioned and those in the process. Research on nontransition-related medical needs is limited; most medical schools don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepare doctors for treating this community.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happens once you get past the immediate issues of transition, and you run into problems with diabetes, cancer, with the E.R.?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Karl Surkan, 46, a professor of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studies at M.I.T. and Temple University.Mr. Surkan, who is transitioning from female to male, has firsthand experience: He carries the BRCA1 gene and was given a diagnosis of breast cancer. When he inquired about whether testosterone would affect his cancer treatments, his oncologist told him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt probably would, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any data on whether testosterone would cause a recurrence of your cancer. We wish we could help you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIndeed, there are few longitudinal studies on hormone use in the trans community. Many doctors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aware that some transgender men may still need pap smears, breast exams and mammograms, and that all transgender women should be screened for prostate problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany transgender men and women have not had genital affirmation surgery and retain reproductive organs they were born with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Harvey Makadon, the director of education and training programs at the Fenway Institute in Boston and a clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll transgender women still have a prostate gland, and a good clinician will need to learn about the current anatomy and provide appropriate preventive screening and care.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn addition to medical concerns, many trans patients say they are discriminated against by doctors and other medical staff members who misuse pronouns, call them by incorrect names or house them with people of the wrong gender.Hospitals, for their part, are often flummoxed. Where, for example, should they put a patient who identifies as female, but is anatomically still male or listed that way on their birth certificate?In July, a transwoman alleged sex discrimination at Brooklyn Hospital Center after being placed in a room with a male roommate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that the individual was transgender,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joan Clark, a hospital spokeswoman. The hospital now requires all employees to undergo sensitivity training. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made us a better organization,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want different treatment, they just want equitable treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWrene Robyn, 46, a transwoman in Somerville, Mass., began her transition in 1989, when she changed her name on her driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license and Social Security cards, and the gender on her driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license from male to female. While she integrates fairly well into mainstream society, she has avoided the doctor for years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost trans people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to the hospital, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re terrified of the room situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re terrified of it all. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be misgendered, and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to explain what they have or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have in their pants.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn April, after a bout of pancreatitis, Ms. Robyn spent a week in Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she was given a single room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody really asked me what my preference was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Robyn, who works as a software engineer at the hospital and also serves on a transgender care committee there. In addition to worrying about being discriminated against, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat goes through a lot of trans people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minds is, is this going to cost more? Usually we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford private rooms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (It was covered by her insurance.)Some hospitals are now overhauling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or implementing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 policies on treating transgender patients. At Mass General, for example, transgender patients are now asked if they prefer a private room or double. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they are going to be placed in a double room, we ask them how they identify themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Terri Ogan, a spokeswoman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the patient identifies as a woman, they will be placed in a room with a woman. If they identify as a man, they will be placed in a room with a man.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTransgender patients at Mount Sinai Health System, which encompasses seven hospitals in New York City, have been housed according to their current gender identity, regardless of where they are in their physical transition, since 2013. They can also request a single room. Previously, the hospital always put them in private rooms, but that had drawbacks: Many patients felt as if they were being segregated, and worried that they would be charged extra (they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t). \u00e2\u0080\u009cOften the transperson would be delayed or in the E.R. waiting for a single room to open up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barbara Warren, the director for L.G.B.T. programs and policies at Mount Sinai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office for diversity and inclusion.Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Northwell Health, which has 21 hospitals in New York City, Long Island and Westchester, said that their transgender policy, which was approved in November of 2014, is to treat transgender patients like any other patient. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily give them a private room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Lynam. But, he acknowledged, the issue becomes a bit more complicated with patients who still look like the sex they were assigned at birth. In that instance, if a roommate objects, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to accommodate them and move the person who complains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Advocates see this as a long time coming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been telling hospitals that they really need to think about this and adopt some policies proactively,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tari Hanneman, deputy director of the Health and Aging Program at the Human Rights Campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first time you think about where you are going to put a transgender patient should not be when they arrive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

The capital smelled of death in its last large outbreak of the Plague, the worst since the Black Death of the 14th century. The diarist Samuel Pepys mourned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day sadder and sadder news of its increase. In the City died this week 7,496; and of all of them, 6,102 of the Plague. But it is feared that the true number of the dead this week is near 10,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 partly from the poor that cannot be taken notice of through the greatness of the number.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the deaths mounted and the streets filled with waste, Londoners noticed that dogs and cats were everywhere in the city. And so the order went out from the Lord Mayor.Kill the dogs and cats.The Chamberlain of the City paid the huntsmen, who slaughtered more than 4,000 animals. But the dogs and cats were chasing the rats that were feeding on the waste \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the rats were carrying the fleas that transmitted the Plague. Now spared from their predators, the rats spread the affliction even more fiercely. The medical advice from London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s College of Physicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to press a hen hard on the swellings until the hen died \u00e2\u0080\u0094 did not slow the disease. In the end, the Plague of 1665 is thought to have killed almost 20 percent of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population (the equivalent of a million and a half people today). A great fire then consumed a third of the city.Many humans and animals died in this crisis of ignorance. Now that we understand the Plague bacterium, we know what procedures and medicines will keep the disease from becoming epidemic. Ignorance, we might say, no longer plagues us.The 20th century marked an inflection point \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the beginning of humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition from its ancient crises of ignorance to its modern crises of invention. Our science is now so penetrating, our systems are so robust, that we are mostly endangered by our own creations. Our bomb-making is now informed by particle physics; our computers are becoming ever-better informed about our private lives.In 1665, half a billion humans sweated to sustain the species near subsistence with their crude implements. Now our global economy is so productive that 16 times that number \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some 8 billion humans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will soon be alive, and most will never have known such poverty.Indeed, our machines have multiplied so much that a new crisis looms because of the smoke coming off them as they combust. Future food crises, if they come, will be driven by anthropogenic climate change. Famine will descend not from the wrath of God but from the growth of gross domestic product. We ourselves are outfitting the Horsemen of the future, or perhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to say that we are creating them.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.Our new crises of invention are so challenging because the bads are so tightly bound with the goods. Breaking the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave chains was a moral triumph; breaking the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply chains is not an option. Climate change is a crisis of invention. So many more people, living longer, eating better, traveling more to see the world and one another \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is it not poignant that these human goods are engendering a mortal danger?II.Molecules are heavy and expensive; bits are fast and cheap. So if the past was about scarcity, the future should be about abundance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the future may well be abundant with trouble. Whether humans can overcome their coming crises of invention will turn on the philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old question of whether individuals are essentially good or evil, which is a hard question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but recent news will tempt many thumbs to turn downward.A more positive answer emerges if we switch to a systems perspective, evaluating humanity as a whole as we would an ecosystem or a complex machine. What happens when humanity \u00e2\u0080\u009cadds\u00e2\u0080\u009d energy to itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what happens when humanity produces and consumes more energy, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done massively in the transition from wood and muscle power to fossil fuels and alternatives?The encouraging answer is that with more energy the species grows like crazy. And adding more energy has also activated some potentiality that has made humans generally more tolerant, more cooperative and more peaceful. Humans have, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, developed energy weapons powerful enough to destroy the entire system. Yet so far, they have not used those weapons to do so. So far, at least, more energy = more humanity.Something is happening to our species, and especially over the last 70 years. The years since 1945 have seen many horrors: the partition of India, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Great Leap Forward, the Vietnam War, the Biafran crisis, the Khmer Rouge and the Rwandan genocide, wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, mass slaughters, civilizational dictatorships, widespread famines and the grueling civil conflicts that have become watchwords for evil in our time. Today our screens overflow with chaos and hate, and today our screens follow us everywhere.Yet this has also been the most prosperous time in human history by far. And by a long way the time with the greatest increase in democracy around the world. It has also been the most peaceful era in recorded human history. What Hegel called the slaughter-bench of history is becoming less bloody.That thesis about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most peaceful era in history\u00e2\u0080\u009d is naturally the hardest to believe, yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. As Joshua Goldstein puts it in \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinning the War on War,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have avoided nuclear wars, left behind world war, nearly extinguished interstate war, and reduced civil wars to fewer countries with fewer casualties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Goldstein continues:The percentage of states perpetrating mass killings of civilians is also well down since 1945, and fatalities from armed assaults on civilians (and from genocide) are down since reliable records have been kept. And while the numbers on deaths from terrorism vary according to the definition of that word, all agree that the numbers of terrorism deaths are quite small compared with those caused by (increasingly rare) wars.These statistics definitely do not prove that animus or madness has ended. No decent person would deny that violence is still much too high everywhere. And there is no guarantee that any of these positive trends will continue.Still, the big picture of postwar history shows significant improvements in nearly all indicators of lived human experience. The average life span of humans is today longer than it has ever been. A smaller proportion of women die in childbirth than ever before. Child malnutrition is at its lowest level ever, while literacy rates worldwide have never been higher. Most impressive has been the recent reduction in severe poverty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the reduction in the percentage of humans living each day on what a tall Starbucks coffee costs in America. During a recent 20-year stretch the mainstream estimate is that the percentage of the developing world living in such extreme poverty shrank by more than half, from 43 to 21 percent.The real trick to understanding our world is to see it with both eyes at once. The world now is a thoroughly awful place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 compared with what it should be. But not compared with what it was. Keeping both eyes open gives depth to our perception of our own time in history, and makes us better able to see where paths to more progress may be open.III.It would be ungenerous to be impatient with humanity, which \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like each one of us \u00e2\u0080\u0094 needs time to learn. It was quite a shock for humankind to wake one day with atomic weapons suddenly in its midst, especially as a world war was then ablaze. In 1945, humanity had little idea how to handle this novel existential threat. But it learned, through death and nightmares, and at least so far, it has done better than many first feared. With ever more crises of invention emerging, humanity will need to learn again, and it will need to learn quicker and better.Humanity does learn, painfully and often only after thousands or even millions have died \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like a giant starfish hurrying over a jagged reef, with only primitive vision, slicing off spines on its way, yet regenerating as it grows and slowly adapting its motion. The currents are pushing the starfish faster, the reefs ahead are sharper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 humanity must become sharper, too. Mainly, humanity learns as identities alter to become less aggressive and more open, so that networks can connect individual capacities more effectively and join our resources together.Many people are still beyond ruthless in pursuing their own interests, yet interests are now more pacific than they once were. Most people around you now do not want to kill you to get your phone, torture you until you profess their religion, or prey on your credulity until you join a racist gang. Some may \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not many. If these profound changes for the better remain unseen, it is likely because of what we now take for granted.What we take for granted frames the size of our concerns. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect that mayors and police chiefs will not endorse, much less order, the lynching of minorities. Within that frame, racial profiling and deaths in police custody are top priorities. After decades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect enduring peace among the great powers. Within that frame any military action by a major power, or a civil war in a resource-rich state, rightly becomes top news.We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relax; the upward trends in time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graphs may crest at any point. Yet batting away the positive facts is lazy, and requires only a lower form of intelligence. There are immense challenges: climate change, resource scarcity, overpopulation, and more. Still, these are the follow-on problems of species achievement, as the world gets more crowded and productivity grows. These are the burdens of our success. Something is happening \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially since World War II \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as we add more energy to our species. What future generations might marvel at most will be if we, in the midst of it, do not see it.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Fire Up Immigration Talk Heading Into South Carolina", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byInstead, the battle lines over immigration have only deepened, as Mr. Trump has maintained his upper hand in the race and the primary campaign has moved into South Carolina and a series of Southern states that vote over the next month.Kellyanne Conway, a strategist for the pro-Cruz group, Keep the Promise, said support for legalizing undocumented immigrants was a \u201ccomplete deal-breaker, an unpardonable sin, among the base.\u201dMr. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigration and for a special \u201cdeportation force\u201d to expel undocumented immigrants, released an ad criticizing Mr. Cruz as untrustworthy on the issue. Mr. Trump later pulled the ad, but on Friday put out a different one highlighting the endorsement of Jamiel Shaw Sr., a man whose son was killed in California by a person the commercial describes as an \u201cillegal immigrant gang member who just got out of prison.\u201dAfter the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.Heading into the debate on Saturday in Greenville, Mr. Rubio, who once championed an immigration bill that would have allowed undocumented workers to obtain legal status, insistently accused Mr. Cruz of being insincere in his support for punitive immigration restrictions.At a campaign stop Thursday in Myrtle Beach, Mr. Rubio twice tied Mr. Cruz to more lenient positions on immigration that are unpopular here. When immigration was up for debate in Washington, Mr. Rubio said, \u201cTed was a passionate spokesperson on behalf of legalizing people that are in this country illegally.\u201dEven Mr. Bush, who has taken a more empathetic view of illegal immigration \u2014 he has called it an \u201cact of love\u201d for people seeking economic opportunity \u2014 has circulated materials at campaign events that stress his stern approach to border security.\u201cThe first priority must be to Secure the Border,\u201d the leaflets say, with the final three words in bold type.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign, said immigration had become a symbolic litmus test on the right, locking the candidates into a protracted struggle, with potentially grave consequences for the fall campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s an authenticity fight \u2014 who\u2019s the authentic conservative?\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who advocated a bipartisan immigration deal in 2013. \u201cThe difference is, immigration is a real issue, it\u2019s a large issue, and you can\u2019t escape that.\u201dShould Republicans enter the fall with a platform based on severe immigration restrictions, it would be the third consecutive presidential race in which the party has tacked to the right on the subject before facing an increasingly diverse national electorate, especially in swing states like Nevada, Florida and Virginia, where there are sizable Latino and Asian-American communities.After the 2008 and 2012 elections, Republican leaders publicly called for the party to soften its platform on immigration. In the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat by President Obama, a report commissioned by the Republican National Committee concluded that supporting immigration reform was essential to the party\u2019s viability in national elections.The gulf between the parties has opened even wider since then: As Republicans have taken a down-the-line conservative stance on immigration, Democrats have lurched still further to the left, and have criticized even the application of existing immigration laws.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But the stakes appear to be higher for the Republicans as they grapple with the perception that their party is hostile to immigrants and nonwhite voters.Proponents of immigration reform have sought to raise the alarm about the trajectory of the Republican race. FWD.us, an organization that supports immigration reform, and is funded in part by the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, cited private polling to warn late last fall that support for large-scale deportation would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d in a general election.\u201cAny candidate who in the general supports mass deportation risks negatively impacting the brand of his or her party for generations to come,\u201d the group said in a memo circulated to allies in both parties.In South Carolina, support for bipartisan immigration reform has not always proved politically toxic. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supports Mr. Bush, won re-election easily in 2014 after backing the same immigration compromise Mr. Rubio supported.But voters here are plainly looking to the candidates for reassurance.At a campaign stop Thursday in which Mr. Rubio criticized Mr. Cruz\u2019s immigration views from the right, Judy Phillips of North Myrtle Beach said some of her concerns about Mr. Rubio\u2019s record had been put to rest.Ms. Phillips, who runs a small furniture business, said it had been important to hear Mr. Rubio\u2019s plans from him directly, after the barrage of immigration-themed ads that she had seen attacking him.\u201cThey keep running that ad about Schumer and him,\u201d Ms. Phillips said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a damaging ad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shukhin, a burly, mustachioed worker said of the factory\u2019s management, stomping his feet against the cold at a labor protest this month on Machinists Square.Day after day, he said, the workers trudge to the factory by the thousands, only to sit out their shifts at idle assembly lines.Now, as far as many workers at Uralvagonzavod are concerned, all that might as well have occurred in a different country, or lifetime. \u201cI don\u2019t think Uralvagonzavod will vote for Putin again \u2014 we saw what that led to,\u201d Mr. Shukhin said. \u201cThis is the opinion of a lot of workers, but a lot of them are afraid to say it. We just don\u2019t understand why they are firing people.\u201dBack then, as oil prices flirted with the $100-a-barrel mark, cash was rolling in and work was plentiful. Mr. Putin, his government sitting on far larger cash reserves than today, was burnishing his image as the savior of factory towns, often arriving at troubled industrial centers in a swirl of television reporters to announce miraculous bailouts.But the economic slump is now starting to bite. Real wages, or salaries adjusted for inflation, a common gauge of how working people feel the economic slump, dropped 6.3 percent in January, compared with the year before.New automobile sales are down a staggering 40 percent, in a country that was recently seen as sailing on a trajectory of growth that would surpass Germany as Europe\u2019s biggest car market. With fewer goods to move, railroads are shunting rolling stock onto sidings and canceling new orders.The economic chill has settled on Nizhny Tagil like a Siberian cold front.The result, here and scattered throughout Russia, has been stirrings of labor unrest, the once widespread scourge of the late Soviet period.Nizhny Tagil has two pivotal industrial plants: one making steel and the other, Uralvagonzavod, turning out train cars and tanks. Both have announced layoffs, though Uralvagonzavod has since said any \u201coptimization\u201d of its work force of roughly 30,000 will be voluntary.The fate of the plants reflects another broad economic trend, as Mr. Putin\u2019s reluctance to cut military spending despite the recession and budget crunch has left that side of the Uralvagonzavod humming. While workers on the train-car side of the factory have been put on two-thirds pay \u2014 about $260 a month \u2014 the tank assembly lines are still rolling full speed, and workers are paid in full.Out on the snowy streets not far from the factory gates, at the recent protest\u2019s scheduled start time, more police officers than protesters appeared on Machinists Square. A surveillance van pulled up.A crew of street cleaners in orange vests blocked the pedestrian walkway to the factory, as if clearing snow, lest workers wandered over after their shift.In the end, a hundred or so people turned out, looking over their shoulders at the uniformed and plainclothes police officers mingling in the crowd, grinning and ostentatiously filming the scene on video cameras.Ilya Korovin, a local activist, stretched a red banner reading \u201cFor Workers\u2019 Rights!\u201d across the pedestal of a statue of Lenin. People milled about on the sidewalk beside a berm of sooty snow; whether taking in the spectacle or joining the protest, it was hard to tell.The assembly lines were idled, the workers\u2019 pay was cut, and the prices of groceries was sky high, Mr. Korovin said. And the management had no plan.\u201cFor more than a year, people go to work but do nothing,\u201d Mr. Korovin said.\u201cThe factory is just broke. But some still think, \u2018Putin loves us; he will throw us some money,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut we have a market economy. You cannot force somebody to buy our products. Most people are counting on Putin, but my comrades, we cannot remake the communist economy.\u201dMikhail G. Scherbakov, a retired shift boss at Uralvagonzavod, said that after 43 years on the assembly line he had a pension was 13,600 rubles, or about $175, a month. \u201cThey either have no conscience, or they have no money,\u201d he said.\u201cThey are just hanging spaghetti on our ears!\u201d Nikolai I. Kalugin, from a political group called the Party of Pensioners, said of the management\u2019s claim to have a pipeline of train car orders, using a Russian expression meaning playing people for fools.In Moscow, Ilya V. Yashin, a leader of the opposition movement that Mr. Kholmanskikh had threatened to crush with his \u201cboys\u201d from the factory, had a message for the laborers.\u201cDear Workers of Uralvagonzavod!\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cIn the end, the workers who not so long ago threatened to scatter the protesters were themselves forced to go to protest against layoffs and violations of their labor rights.

Mike Huckabee of Arkansas or former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania continuing without a strong showing in a state each man won in previous elections. Former Gov.

Mr. Moore, who supports Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination, predicted that in a general election Mr. Trump would temper some of his hard-line conservative positions but that he would also attract far more enthusiasm than Hillary Clinton could drum up as the Democratic nominee.

He is also pushing back against attacks by rivals who have cast him as weak on foreign policy and national defense.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has repeatedly attacked Mr. Cruz for refusing to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the military. And the Texas senator has also come under scrutiny for his decision to support the USA Freedom Act, compromise legislation that limited the National Security Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to collect bulk metadata from phone records.Mr. Cruz has said he voted against the defense authorization bills because they did not explicitly ban President Obama from indefinitely detaining United States citizens without due process.Though Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positions on national security \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he is less hawkish than Mr. Rubio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 helped him win over some supporters of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who dropped out of the presidential race \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in New Hampshire, voters in South Carolina have typically gravitated toward candidates eager for a strong commander in chief.In his address, Mr. Cruz criticized both Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, a secretary of state in the Obama administration, and seemed to try to strike a balance between promising to be tough on national defense by increasing the size of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighting force, while also promising not to be to quick to intervene in conflicts around the globe. And he promised smarter spending on defense.Mr. Cruz also weighed in on other issues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what to do with Syrian refuges, immigration and women in combat.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not going to admit refugees into the United States who may have been infiltrated by ISIS terrorists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, to applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not going to grant American citizenship to individuals who are here illegally.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the father of two daughters, I can tell you we are not going to draft American women into military combat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz did not specifically explain how he would pay for his military expansion, but pointed to his spending plan, which he said would reduce the federal budget by $500 billion over 10 years, and also talked about reducing \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaste, fraud and abuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the Pentagon.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, and foremost, we are not going to expand the bloated bureaucracy that is stifling progress and innovation at the Pentagon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.Directly addressing his critics, Mr. Cruz said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too expensive to defend this nation, try not defending it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe concluded by talking about the illustrious history of the U.S.S. Yorktown, and conjuring an image of a stronger America.\u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will be standing on the decks of the mightiest ships the world has ever known with their heads held high, confident that the great country that they volunteered to serve has their back.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSpeaking to reporters after the event, Mr. Cruz couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but take aim at Donald J. Trump, his chief rival, who has threatened to sue him over his eligibility to run for president, because he was born in Canada.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems that Donald is very rattled right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gets very upset and when he gets upset, he engages in insults.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "\u2018Son of Saul,\u2019 Kierkegaard and the Holocaust", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "I.Written and directed by the Hungarian filmmaker L\u00c3\u00a1szl\u00c3\u00b3 Nemes, \u201cSon of Saul\u00e2\u0080\u009d won awards at Cannes, the Golden Globes and elsewhere before making its way to the Oscars to win the award for best foreign language film. It follows a day in the life of Saul, a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of mostly Jewish prisoners the Nazis forced to assist with herding people to the gas chambers, burning the bodies and collecting gold and valuables from the corpses. The film creates a direct, experiential and visceral engagement with these events by maintaining a relentless focus on the minute-to-minute unfolding of Saul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world.II.Much of Kierkegaard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy is a warning against the tendency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 greatly accelerated in modern times \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to take an increasingly objective, abstract perspective on the world. While the paradigm example of this is science, it is most problematic when applied to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own life and existence. To identify life with its abstractions is, in Kierkegaard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, a dangerous but all too common error.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.This line of thought holds that human significance comes from subjective experience and that human beings cannot thrive without an orientation towards, and engagement with, the subjective experience of their lives, and that, as a matter of fact, a predominantly objective, conceptual orientation to oneself is detrimental to well being. As Kierkegaard put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cScience and\u00c2\u00a0scholarship\u00c2\u00a0want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIII.Read previous contributions to this series.Most commonly, we turn our back on subjectivity to escape from pain. Suffering, one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, or others\u00e2\u0080\u0099, might become bearable, one hopes, when one takes a step back and views it objectively, conceptually, abstractly. And when it comes to something as monumental as the Holocaust, one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind cannot help but be numbed by the sheer magnitude of it. How could one feel the pain of all those people, sympathize with millions? Instead one is left with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfacts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the numbers.It achieves this by not letting the viewer off the hook, by demanding participation, as far as it is possible in the imagination, in the experience of the Holocaust. As Kierkegaard puts it in \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither/Or,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor one may have known a thing many times and acknowledged it \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and yet it is only by the deep inward movements, only by the indescribable emotions of the heart, that for the first time you are convinced that what you have known belongs to you \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for only the truth that edifies is truth for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn addition to employing a subjective approach visually, Nemes also makes subjectivity the theme of the film. It depicts the loss of subjectivity both at the larger societal level, as well as at the level of the individual. It is this double engagement of subjectivity that makes the film so effective.The death camp is the absurd end point of technological thinking, of the objectification of human beings. Totalitarian regimes the world over know the value and power of subjectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is why they work so hard to destroy it. Murdered Jews are referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpieces\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the movie by the German camp administrators. The victims are denied the status of subjects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they are mere physical objects to be dealt with. In this world of mechanized objectivity, the Nazi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial brutality is considered entirely normal. Any individual not obeying its construct of proper behavior only has their own conscience to rely on.At a yet deeper level, it is the subjectivity of its protagonist that is the main theme of the movie. Through his encounter with the boy Saul gains back his soul. At the moment that Saul witnesses the killing of the boy, he becomes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in Kierkegaard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful expression \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Knight of Faith, someone who made a commitment, and who can pursue it with passion, as if it was the surest thing, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Saul is finally able to experience the death and destruction around him by committing to this one, dead boy; not unlike the film nudges the viewers to relate to the Holocaust as real, by committing them to this one, near dead protagonist. Having seen it you will remember, deliriously, having been there, in some small part of your body. It is a duty created by the Holocaust, suggests the movie. It is a dark counterpart of the imperative for Jews to relive the experience of deliverance from bondage into freedom each year at Passover.At the same time that it depicts Saul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSon of Saul\u00e2\u0080\u009d also directly engages the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjectivity by its style and mode of presentation; its achievement is to embody the dynamic that is its very subject matter. Kierkegaard called such communication \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only sort he thought befitting a subjective thinker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble reflection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought this is the only way that the authenticity of the message can be guarded \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only way to avoid being a town crier of subjectivity. In this way, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSon of Saul\u00e2\u0080\u009d is both art and philosophy: It makes inwardness visible. Through its depiction of death and destruction it reminds us how to live.Katalin Balog is an associate professor of philosophy at Rutgers University-Newark.

{"Headline": "Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Things are about to change for the sport in Europe\u2019s newest country as developers plan to rebuild and vastly expand the industry there.Supported byThe flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, some 40 inches of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we\u2019d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce about 35 miles south of Pristina, storms slam into the 8,000-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent\u2019s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the \u201980s, the resort\u2019s hey-decade, 10 lifts, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and by 2013 none of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer. When complete, the resort, at 8,000 acres, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, about 2,600 feet. The number of hotel beds will grow from 700 to 7,000 \u2014 three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will have 100 miles of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo\u2019s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.And yet there is hope.\u201cIf we can do this, we can do anything,\u201d said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica\u2019s but that\u2019s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He was 42, a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.\u201cWhat time will the lifts start running?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou mean, if they start running,\u201d Igor replied.That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, in 2013, when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for \u20ac7 \u2014 about $9 at the time \u2014 the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort\u2019s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.It was some of the best skiing I\u2019d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line. Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. Sometime in 2014, as the French were quietly studying the resort\u2019s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again. The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort\u2019s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.\u201cIt went up like paper,\u201d said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou pick yourself up and move on. What else.\u201dStoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. Some 80 percent of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a \u20ac180 million expansion in 2013 and is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament\u2019s self-tear-gassing attacks.The resort\u2019s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs. Drive around the country and you\u2019ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. The resort could provide as many as 3,000 jobs, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is under 30 and 58 percent of the work force is \u201cinactive.\u201dBut more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region\u2019s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination. The efforts appear to be working. In 2014, 3.7 million international tourists visited Albania, up from about 645,000 in 2004. And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.\u201cKosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,\u201d said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. \u201cBrezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.\u201dMaybe so, but \u201cit\u2019s just hugely important to be sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets. What is needed, he said, are \u201cthoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.\u201dAcross the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has completed 15 master plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build a $5 billion \u201ctourist city\u201d with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia\u2019s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia\u2019s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent \u20ac30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it\u2019s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area\u2019s first general manager after the resort opened in 1954. In the \u201970s he built a hut that would become Tina\u2019s pizzeria under Igor in 1993. Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything \u2014 the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get about $250,000 in expropriation fees, but money isn\u2019t the issue.\u201cWe\u2019re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,\u201d Igor said. \u201cThe mountains are in me.\u201dOver the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren\u2019t running. The Dane guys weren\u2019t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.I lounged around Tina\u2019s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina\u2019s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: \u201cStupid politicians caused it.\u201d On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: \u201cWe never have an argument.\u201d On why I should not clear the table: \u201cThis is Balkans,\u201d Draginja said. \u201cWomen do this.\u201dI helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria\u2019s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.\u201cThere is something beautiful when everything is broken,\u201d Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. \u201cEveryone comes together.\u201dOn the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals \u20ac5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or \u201cmeadow\u201d in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko\u2019s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn\u2019t have one. I asked where to buy it.\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t need a ticket,\u201d said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed about $3 worth of coins into the attendant\u2019s palm. \u201cCome, come,\u201d my new friend said, and off we went.Rexhep Krasniqi, 58, had fled Kosovo 23 years ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance. Isak was now unemployed but not worried. \u201cWe are good at surviving,\u201d he said.I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride to 10 days of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it. Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. A single ride cost about $3.25, though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that. As best as I could tell a day pass cost about $11.Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to about $21, a fortune when the average worker earns about $380 a month. \u201cNo more corruption,\u201d a local told me later, \u201cbut less skiers.\u201dWe picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion\u2019s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay the $5 bill. \u201cNo Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,\u201d he said, politely but firmly. \u201cYou are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.\u201dMy last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort, 8,274-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit after 45 minutes. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn\u2019t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina\u2019s once stood, and the legs I\u2019d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don\u2019t you long for it to stay the way it is?Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.Expect to pay about 50 euros each way for transfers from Pristina. Lift tickets now cost \u20ac20 a day.Tim Neville, who lives in Oregon, writes frequently about the outdoors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Pledges to Focus on the Plight of Disenfranchised Blacks", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders spent Tuesday courting black voters in South Carolina with promises that he would combat institutional racism, reform police departments across the country, and make getting an education and a well-paying job easier.Speaking to a group of religious leaders and students at a prayer breakfast at Allen University, a small historically black college here, Mr. Sanders stressed that he would transform an economy that has left many blacks behind. Mr. Sanders then hosted a town-hall-style meeting at the University of South Carolina. He was accompanied by State Representative Justin T. Bamberg of South Carolina, the lawyer for the family of Walter L. Scott, who was fatally shot last year by a police officer in North Charleston, S.C.; and Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, who died in New York in 2014 after the police used a chokehold to subdue him.Flanked by Ms. Garner and Mr. Bamberg, Mr. Sanders told the crowd of 300 mostly young white people that he wanted not only to overhaul the criminal justice system, but also make sure that police officers who break the law were held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of seeing videos, videos of Erica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad and other videos of unarmed people being killed by police officers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is going on now, especially with regard to African-Americans \u2014 this is not new. It has been going on decade, after decade, after decade. The only difference is the cellphone video. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only difference because what was going on in the past was never recorded and the police officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony was accepted as truth. This video, this cellphone, makes all the difference in the world. So clearly as a nation we need criminal justice reform.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator also said he wanted to make sure that recidivism rates decrease and that people coming out of jails and prisons receive the job training needed to rebuild their lives. He also said that blacks in general need to be treated more fairly by the police, and he expressed disappointment in the way some police forces have systematically discriminated against blacks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to achieve the day when young black males and women can walk the streets without worrying about being harassed by a police officer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have talked to African-American Ph.D.s who get nervous when they have to travel or drive across the country. That should not be happening in the year 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also pledged that if elected he would work to change things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo count me in as somebody who if elected president will help lead the country in the fight against institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders made his remarks as he and his rival, Hillary Clinton, are scrambling for black support heading into the Feb. 27 primary in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton holds a lead in polls but  Mr. Sanders is working hard to gain ground. Mrs. Clinton was also giving a civil rights speech Tuesday, in Harlem.Mr. Sanders said he believed he could win the Democratic primary here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn South Carolina, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how far behind we started,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have come a long way here in South Carolina. I think we are going to surprise people here.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier in the day, at Allen University, Mr. Sanders highlighted that a high percentage of black children live in poverty (he said 35 percent)  and that an even higher percentage of young black people \u2014 51 percent \u2014 were unemployed.While delivering parts of his standard stump speech, Mr. Sanders also stressed that the \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was leading him to focus on the plight of blacks and propose changes to improve their conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we talk about inequality, it goes without saying that the African-American community is suffering even more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders told the crowd of 400 mostly black people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when we talk about what is going on in this country, and the fact that virtually the entire nation suffered terribly as a result of the greed and reckless and illegal behavior of Wall Street, which drove this economy into a terrible recession, the African-American community suffered more and has recovered in a much less significant way.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTuesday evening, Mr. Sanders planned to travel to Morehouse College in Atlanta as part of his tour of historically black colleges and universities.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "As News Media Changes, Bernie Sanders\u2019s Critique Remains Constant", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byAnd that was just the news programs. Commercials, he went on, employed \u201cHitlerian\u201d tactics in which the public is \u201cbombarded\u201d with short, simple messages in keeping with the owners\u2019 mission to \u201ccreate a nation of morons who will faithfully go out and buy this or that product, vote for this or that candidate.\u201dHe may have softened his language, but Mr. Sanders\u2019s critique of the news media, as in nearly everything else, has remained constant as he has risen over the last 40 years from radical protester and protest candidate to mayor, congressman, senator and now a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. Despite the advent of the Internet, the diminishing of traditional news media companies and the emergence of new media Goliaths like Facebook that have helped fuel his rise, Mr. Sanders remains orthodox in his mass media doctrine.With that, the crowd at his victory party roared \u201cBernie, Bernie, Bernie\u201d as it turned to jeer the assembled news media.As Mr. Sanders sees it, the profit-hungry billionaire owners of news media companies serve up lowest-common-denominator coverage, purposefully avoid the income-inequality issues he prioritizes and mute alternative voices as they take over more and more outlets.It is a view that imbues the candidate\u2019s interactions with reporters covering his presidential campaign. Ask him how much time he has for an interview, and he responds, \u201cIf you are a typical media idiot, hmm, 12 seconds.\u201d Inquire about the sword hanging on the wall of his Senate office, and he responds: \u201cWhen media gives you a problem, take it out! Threaten them!\u201dThe Clinton campaign, however, argues that Mr. Sanders has benefited from the superficial horse-race journalism he scorns, and that coverage has largely focused on his avuncular style and cross-generational appeal rather than thorough inspections of his proposals or record. In the Vermont senator\u2019s continual discrediting of the news media, the Clinton campaign sees an effort to inoculate himself from critical coverage.\u201cHe should get more scrutiny,\u201d said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster. In admiring words rarely uttered by a political operative, he added: \u201cYou guys in the media are the referees. You are independent. You aren\u2019t partisan.\u201dAt the end of the interview, the show\u2019s host, Chris Wallace, told Mr. Sanders, \u201cI hope you feel that you haven\u2019t been mistreated,\u201d and asked if he would be willing to participate in a Democratic debate on the network. Mr. Sanders said that if the rules were fair and the Democratic National Committee endorsed it, \u201cI would have no objection.\u201dBut throughout his career, Mr. Sanders has found most all news media, even public television, objectionable.\u201cI certainly never thought of us as elite or wealthy,\u201d said Ann Curran, the station\u2019s spokeswoman at the time. She recalled phone drives and being \u201cexcited when somebody gave us 50 bucks.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Part of it seemed to be motivated by a desire to get on a broadcast.A decade later, speaking at a \u201cMedia Bash\u201d with the anarchist and social activist Abbie Hoffman, whom Mr. Sanders called a national treasure, he lamented the movement away from serious journalism toward \u201cthe USA Today\u201d trend of \u201csimple and stupid and color pictures.\u201d He complained that a program that he had produced defending the socialist leader Eugene V. Debs would not be broadcast by public television because he was told it was \u201cbiased\u201d and did not give \u201ctwo sides to the story.\u201d He said proudly that he had gotten the program on television and the station director fired.(Ms. Curran said she did not recall any firing.)Instead, there has been a proliferation of new media offering alternative voices, and traditional news sources have shrunk in an Internet age of diminishing advertising revenue.And the new billionaire-owned media giants are the social media platforms where his message, \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d memes and appeals for contributions tend to redound more than local reporting on the issues he is passionate about.Through Facebook, for example, Mr. Sanders is imparting his view of the news media to a new generation of supporters. In an opera house in Rochester, N.H., this month, Savanha Brook nodded in approval when Mr. Sanders promoted his health care plan as a cost saver, \u201cdespite what you may occasionally read in the media.\u201dMs. Brook, 21, said Mr. Sanders had taught her that reporters \u201care in the pockets of big corporations.\u201d She said that rather than trusting what corporate news media wrote about him, she preferred to watch his speeches on YouTube or read about him on Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Improving Startup Time in the NYTimes Android App", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Improving application startup and load time has been a priority for The New York Times Android development team, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone. As device manufacturers continue to offer faster and more fluid experiences, users expect their native apps to be faster still. Our team recently rewrote our news app to take advantage of modern patterns such as dependency injection and reactive programming. The rewrite offered improvements in maintenance, code modernization and modularization benefits, but required some adjustments to optimize.When we initially released our new app, which we nicknamed Phoenix, startup time was a modest 5.6 seconds on a Nexus 5. This was longer than our goal: 2 seconds or less. This motivated us to put some effort into improving our performance.We found that most of the slowdown was caused by issues with reflection. After addressing these and fixing other smaller things, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reduced our current startup time to 1.6 seconds.Some third-party analytics clients we have incorporated into our app had some blocking calls during app startup. We made some changes to how they were being instantiated and worked with vendors to help improve large upfront instantiation.We also uncovered a number of small technical debt issues in our codebase: blocking object instantiation on an md5 calculation, blocking in constructors and generally doing too much work up front.This became a pain point when, for example, an analytics configuration value was needed from the disk during app launch but had to wait for blocking SSL-enabled network clients to instantiate. As the app grew and more dependencies were added, our content manager instantiation time increased, causing subsequent app starts to be as slow as initial installs.We began by breaking our content manager into individual singleton data stores backed by disk and network DAOs. For example, we broke out a ConfigStore backed by ConfigNetworkDAO and ConfigDiskDAO from our content manager. We leaned on Dagger\u2019s Lazy instantiation, which allowed us to inject a lazy network client and not instantiate it until we actually do a network operation \u2014 important when offline or after the first load. Our architecture relies heavily on downloading data using background services. As a result, data is mostly loaded from disk storage to UI rather than having to make a network call. After we were able to create an optimal path from disk to screen we came to our next major speed hog: reflection. Our current data flow looks something like this:A background Service subscribes to an RxStore which lazily instantiates a network client and downloads fresh data in JSON. This is done on a schedule or from a push alert. We then stream the JSON data to disk. We use the streaming API rather than saving the JSON as a single object because it prevents us from needing to instantiate value objects over one megabyte into memory. We will continue to explore other methods such as FlatBuffers for serializing data for disk storage; however, we are generally pleased with our current results. A relaunch of our app offers users a full view of the home page in under two seconds.Reflection can cause significant performance issues on Android, especially for large, data-driven apps. For this reason, it should be avoided whenever possible, especially during app startup. Open is a blog about code and development written by New York Times developers. We cover everything from our open source projects and APIs to the technology powering our latest products.FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Global Expansion Good for Times Readers?", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "These new readers will help attract new digital advertising, and may eventually pay for subscriptions. (At the moment, there is no pay wall for the Spanish-language site, which offers 10 to 15 translated Times articles a day \u2014 culled from hundreds of possible articles \u2014 and also produces some original journalism, which may be reverse-translated for English-speaking readers.)But there is a second, less obvious benefit: a deepening of the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting strength in various regions of the world. The Times has hired six experienced Spanish-speaking reporters and editors in Mexico. That hiring has been made easier because Mexico has become a very difficult and dangerous place to do hard-hitting journalism, and working under the umbrella of The Times can mean a little more protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are all very ambitious journalists in their own right, with a reputation for digging and asking tough questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the International editor, Joseph Kahn, told me. (Among them, for example, is Alberto Arce, formerly of The Associated Press.)The new staff amounts to \u00e2\u0080\u009can impressive force multiplier\u00e2\u0080\u009d for The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise journalism in Latin America \u2014 something that should benefit all readers, he said.And this will be replicated in other parts of the world as The Times starts other, similar efforts \u2014 probably at least two more this year, according to Lydia Polgreen, the deputy International editor in charge of the global-growth effort. She declined to say where they might be.The hope, though, is for substantial readership growth over the next two or three years. There are signs of considerable interest: The Spanish site quickly garnered 250,000 \u00e2\u0080\u009clikes\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Facebook and 25,000 Twitter followers, Ms. Polgreen said.Mr. Kahn described the readership goal in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u009cengaged readers\u00e2\u0080\u009d who are regular digital visitors. The Times has an audience that includes 30 million unique visitors a month outside the United States; of that number, about 1.5 million are the sought-after engaged readers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to significantly more than double that number of engaged readers in the next few years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kahn said.Such problems are unlikely in Mexico but, Ms. Polgreen said, there are plenty of other challenges. Translating Times journalism so that it is not only accurate but also has the right idioms, phrasing and tone \u2014 while still remaining true to The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style \u2014 is tricky.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wrestled a lot with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a literary art to translation, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some spirited debates.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSometimes, the incessant drive for new readers seems inconsistent with core Times values. This global expansion, though, may well prove helpful to the journalism as well as to the bottom line.The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice.  \nThe Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog.\nThe public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. \nReaders complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya.  \nThose who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official.Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretrial hearing? Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. The public editor travels to Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shorenstein Center.

My column for this week.The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd.The Times is reconsidering the use of the term \"illegal immigrant.\"An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards.A crisis in North Africa and a reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage.Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings.The research and development team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chronicle tool may distract you while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting for the returns to come in.Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy.  An activist wants The Times to stop using the term \"illegal immigrant\" in its reporting.  After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed.A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context.A headline ignites a discussion about its \"undermining\" question. News organizations should evaluate the motivations of parents who want to take their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story public.Parental approval and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own willingness should rule the day.Readers complained about the absence of people of color in T: The Times Style Magazine.The Times Magazine interviewer offended some high-profile female writers with his questions.Where, after what seemed like women's night on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention, was the coverage of pay equity, along with gender-economic issues in general?Michael Kimmelman views architecture in terms of public policy as well as aesthetics.The criticism of a new restaurant in Times Square was delicious, even if the food was not. The critic Pete Wells gave his first \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d restaurant rating in The Times -- and he did it memorably. Cathy Horyn's work can't please everyone -- but this is ridiculous. Advertisement"}

Have you come up with a new kind of school, or new ideas for lowering the rate of urban shootings?Thanks, but we have lots of those.Whatever problem possesses you, we already have plenty of ways to solve it. Many have been rigorously tested and have a lot of evidence behind them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting on a shelf.So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invent something new. If you want to make a contribution, choose one of those ideas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and spread it.Well, you might not know about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no quick system for finding it.In short, this work requires dedicated organizations, a smart program and lots of money.The other meaning of spreading an idea is creating ways to get new inventions out to people who need them.What happened then? The world finally started putting money into fighting malaria, including distributing bed nets. Today, deaths from malaria are one third of what they were in 2004.The invention was crucial, of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it was distribution that gave it impact.Also in 2004, a French researcher named Pascaline Dupas, working in Kenya, was talking to a Kenyan colleague who was running to give some money to her high school-age sister. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese girls have no money, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want her to end up with a sugar daddy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the colleague said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dupas replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she know she could get H.I.V.?\u00e2\u0080\u009dPerhaps she did know, but the vast majority of girls in Kenya did not. The assumption was widespread that someone relatively wealthy and established was unlikely to have the virus. Three quarters of 15-year-old Kenyans surveyed thought teenage boys were more likely to be infected than men over 25.This was very wrong. H.I.V. rates were six times higher in men aged 20-24 than they were in boys 15-19, and the rates rose with each additional year of sexual activity.Across the world, but especially in high-poverty countries, many high school girls look for boyfriends who are five to 10 years older, because those men have sophistication, stability and money. These sugar daddies give the girls gifts, pick them up from school in nice cars, pay their school fees and even help their families.Moreover, girls are much more likely to have unprotected sex with a sugar daddy than with boys their own age. The power imbalance in the relationship makes it difficult to insist on condom use. And avoiding pregnancy is less important to them, as wealthier and more stable men make better husbands and are more likely to marry them than teen boys are.Sugar daddies were one big reason that the H.I.V. rate for teenage girls in Kenya was five times higher than for teenage boys. Dupas wondered if simply providing the girls with correct information about the relative risks could change things.She designed a 40-minute lesson to help girls in eighth grade (average age: 15) to understand the H.I.V. risks associated with sugar daddies. It started with a 10-minute video. Then a facilitator from a local civic group showed statistics about actual infection rates by age and gender. The class discussed the reasons for these patterns, and gradually came around to talking about sugar daddies.This training was tested in 328 schools in western Kenya against the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard school anti-AIDS curriculum, which promoted abstinence. Dupas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message was very different: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour risks are far less if you choose a partner your own age.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt made us very popular with the young boys in the class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.The next year, Dupas counted how many girls had become pregnant, and recorded the fathers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ages. The group that heard Dupas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lesson had a pregnancy rate 28 percent lower than those who received the standard abstinence-based curriculum. And their rate of child bearing with men five years or more their senior was 61 percent less.Dupas didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have money to do H.I.V. testing, so she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t study the effects on H.I.V. incidence. But pregnancy is likely a good stand-in for unprotected sex, and therefore H.I.V. infections.For a 40-minute single intervention at negligible cost, it was a stunning impact.Read previous contributions to this series.The Randomistas have identified programs that work well and cheaply: bed nets, school-based deworming to rid children of parasites, installing chlorine dispensers at village taps, among others.

Karen Levy, the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director of global innovation and beta, said that the challenges differ greatly from those of inventing something new: How do you fit the program into a country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy and regulatory framework?

{"Headline": "Welsh Town Leads a British Revolt Against the Tax System and Corporations", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byWales JournalCRICKHOWELL, Wales \u2014 Fifty small businesses line the cobbled streets of Crickhowell. There is a bookstore and a bakery, a salmon smokery and a pub.Then there is Steven Lewis\u2019s coffee shop, Number 18 Cafe & Brasserie, which, like a lot of the other mom-and-pop operations in Crickhowell, houses a grievance that resonates far beyond the town\u2019s borders.Mr. Lewis, 63, a broad-chested former military man, has helped turn Crickhowell into ground zero for a revolt by small-business owners in Britain against a tax system they see as rigged against them in favor of multinational corporations like Facebook, Google and Starbucks. The town, population 2,063, has become famous for being one of Britain\u2019s last holdouts against the encroachment of big retail chains.Mr. Lewis said he paid the 21 percent corporate tax rate on his profits last year, equivalent to 31,000 pounds, or $45,200. By contrast, Facebook \u2014 which is based in the United States but does business in Britain and is therefore subject to British taxes \u2014 paid just \u00a34,327, or $6,274, in corporate tax in 2014, or about one-seventh of what Mr. Lewis paid.Facebook\u2019s bill was also less than the average personal income tax payment and the national insurance contributions that individual British employees pay, which amount to about $7,800 a year for someone making the median income of $40,000.That is just one glaring example, Mr. Lewis and his fellow shopkeepers in Crickhowell said, of what amounts to multinational tax dodging on a gargantuan scale, leaving the little guy to pick up the tab. And their protest is one small case study of how economic populism is playing out around the world, rallying grass-roots support to challenge governments and corporate interests alike.Mr. Lewis, who retired from the army as a major and fought in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, is working with his regiment of shopkeepers to stoke public indignation across Britain so that consumers, and ultimately shareholders, will pressure company executives to change the way they do business. He plans to use social media and doorstep protests to \u201cname and shame\u201d corporate chiefs and those who support them, right down to their tax accountants.\u201cAlways fight on the ground of your own choosing, never on the enemy\u2019s ground,\u201d he said, reaching for a military metaphor.His most recent effort at consciousness-raising came late last year, when he tried to replicate a favored financial tactic of multinationals and have Crickhowell and its businesses incorporate in tax havens. No dice, said the British tax authorities: Towns, unlike companies, are not allowed to register offshore, and Crickhowell\u2019s small businesses did not meet the legal definitions necessary to qualify for such a move.But Mr. Lewis has pledged to fight on, drawing on what he said were the approaches he learned combating terrorists.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty brutal,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe will go for the throat.\u201dBritain\u2019s tax authority, Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, said in a recent report that the amount of tax lost to Britain because of avoidance schemes was an estimated $4.3 billion in 2014, though it has fallen sharply over recent years as the government closes loopholes.But the authorities routinely come under fire for not doing enough. In the latest example, a $288 million settlement in back taxes with Google was heavily criticized because the company\u2019s sales and profits ran into the billions. Many American companies that do business in Britain benefit from corporate taxes that are much lower than in the United States, where the combined federal and state statutory corporation tax is 39.1 percent. Facebook has said that it is \u201ccompliant with U.K. tax law\u201d and has emphasized that employees residing in Britain pay income tax on their earnings.\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d said Steven Askew, a baker in Crickhowell, as he took a break from work, his arms covered in flour. He and his wife each work 80 hours a week, he said, and paid more income tax than Facebook. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to stand up and say enough is enough. Enough with the injustice,\u201d he added.Rose Tabb, who works in a chocolate shop in Crickhowell close to the ruins of a 13th-century castle, was adamant. \u201cEither we all pay, or we don\u2019t,\u201d she said.Jo Carthew owns the Black Mountains Smokery on the outskirts of town. Multinational companies are able to reinvest what they do not pay in taxes, she said, allowing them to grow ever bigger and stronger. She has not been able to afford expanding her staff since the company started more than 10 years ago, she said. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve learned about how widespread these offshore strategies are used, the more indignant I\u2019ve become.\u201dOf course, the tax offenders are not just American. There is Caff\u00e8 Nero, the London-based coffee chain that did not pay a penny of corporate tax in Britain for a decade. Cadbury, the British confectioner bought by Mondelez International of the United States in 2010, then named Kraft, has not paid taxes for the past five years, despite making about $144 million in profits each year.Large companies, especially those that operate around the world, typically employ complex, aggressive and sometimes creative financial techniques to hold taxes to a minimum, often by offloading some of the profits from higher-tax countries to lower-tax ones. Britain\u2019s tax authority defines the practice as \u201coperating within the letter \u2014 but not the spirit \u2014 of the law.\u201dMany shops in Crickhowell already have stickers pasted on their windows that declare themselves part of a \u201cFair Tax Town,\u201d and 27 towns across Britain have signed up to that initiative, Mr. Lewis said.Another of his aims is to have the tax authorities enforce a five-star system that would rate which companies have paid the appropriate taxes and make the results public.\u201cThe multinationals want to be in an incredible haze of technical complexity because they want to hide in it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what I want to do is get a big gust of wind that blows all that away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ask Well: The Sugar in Fruit", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 693 votesNot if the fruit in question is whole fruit. Unlike honey, cane sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and other forms of sugar that are added to many processed foods, the sugar naturally found in fruit is consumed in the company of fiber, which helps your body absorb the sugar more slowly.  When you consume a food or beverage that contains carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks the carbs down into a type of sugar called glucose, which enters the bloodstream. When blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas produces the hormone insulin, a signal to your cells to absorb the glucose so it can be used immediately as energy or stored in the liver and muscles for later use. Repeatedly eating foods that cause surges in blood sugar makes the pancreas work harder. Over time, that can lead to insulin resistance and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Refined grain products like white bread, crackers, and cookies, which tend to be low in fiber, deliver large amounts of carbohydrates per serving and are digested very quickly, raising blood sugar and insulin levels. Sugars enter into the bloodstream especially rapidly when you consume carbohydrates in liquid form, such as in sugary sodas. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as simple as adding fiber to starchy foods or soda \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the quality and physical form of carbohydrates are critical, which means favoring whole foods over processed foods and added sugars. That includes favoring whole fruit over fruit juice: Fruit juices can contain fiber, but some of that fiber is broken down in the juicing process, reducing the metabolic benefit compared with intact fruit.To minimize spikes in insulin, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to eat fruit whole. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because with whole fruit the cell walls remain intact, said Dr. David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital. This is how fiber can offer the greatest benefit, he explained, because the sugars are effectively sequestered within the fiber scaffolding of the cells, and it takes time for the digestive tract to break down those cells. Four apples may contain the same amount of sugar as 24 ounces of soda, but the slow rate of absorption minimizes the blood sugar surge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we take a nutrient-centric approach, just looking at sugar grams on the label, none of this is evident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Ludwig said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it really requires a whole foods view.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSophie Egan is the director of programs and culinary nutrition for strategic initiatives at the Culinary Institute of America.

{"Headline": "When Cancer Treatment Offers Hope More Than Cure", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "We joked that she had nine lives.And like a cat, over the years, no matter the adversity \u2014 the extreme toxicities that resulted from her many rounds of chemotherapy, the bowel perforation that left her with an ostomy, the trips to the intensive care unit \u2014 she always landed on her feet, the wattage of her personality undimmed.With the most recent return of her leukemia in the fall, I asked her, not for the first time, if she had been through enough, and would like to forgo any more treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not ready to give up yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI still got a whole lot of living yet to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer partner of 45 years was sitting next to her, his arms crossed over his Cleveland Browns shirt, his hoary beard making his reaction to her comment somewhat inscrutable, other than his nodding. He came to every appointment, and always deferred to her, offering his opinions on the woeful state of Cleveland sports teams, but on nothing having to do with her medical condition. He just quietly supported her decisions. Though I had learned his name when I first met them years ago, I had since forgotten it in favor of what she called him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Boo. I referred to him as \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Boo.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhenever her leukemia returned, she never asked about the likelihood that chemotherapy would work. Even if she had, my response would have been, by necessity, vague. No studies of patients who have had multiple relapses of leukemia have compared one treatment approach to another, and those that report outcomes in such patients suffer from what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfounding by indication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, people who are healthier are more likely to be offered chemotherapy, and thus more likely to live longer regardless of what they received. My patient was just such a person.She entered the hospital to receive more chemotherapy, and as before became profoundly ill, narrowly skirting death yet again. Five weeks later, her blood counts had returned to normal, indicating that the leukemia had receded one more time, and she was back in clinic. I walked into her room to give her the good news.She was a shadow of her former self.Slumped in a wheelchair, she sat listing to one side, clutching a tissue in one hand. Mr. Boo sat close by, his arms crossed over a Cleveland Cavaliers shirt. I nodded to him and then asked her how she was doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired, Lord have mercy I am tired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. Mr. Boo said nothing. I moved a chair next to hers and held her hand as she cried quietly, the three of us absorbed in her emotions, enveloped by the silence in the room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one was tough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said eventually, stating the obvious. She nodded. I turned to her partner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s she doing at home, Mr. Boo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, rearranging himself to sit up in his chair a little straighter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard, though. She spends most of her time on the couch, and gets from there to the bathroom and back. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI turned back to my patient, still holding her hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about we take a little break from the treatment?\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe nodded, and we sat in silence again. After a while, she asked \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we gonna get started on chemo again?\u00e2\u0080\u009dI looked uncertainly at her and then at Mr. Boo. He looked back at me, awaiting my reply. This time, I rearranged myself to sit up a little straighter in my chair.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I have to wonder if giving you more chemotherapy is the right thing to do, with all that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering if we should be talking about bringing more care into your home, to assist both you and Mr. Boo. Maybe even hospice.\u00e2\u0080\u009dI had said the word. Though I explained to her the many benefits of hospice, how their providers could help her at home in a way I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in relieving her symptoms, and in making her more comfortable, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet me in the eyes for the rest of the appointment, almost as if I had betrayed her.She hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been eating or drinking much at home, so I admitted her to the hospital for a few days for hydration and she perked up, rising like Lazarus yet again, and returned to my clinic the following week.She was smiling, laughing, had been doing well with physical therapy, and even was able to get out of her wheelchair to the exam table.And she wanted to discuss the next round of chemotherapy.For my patient, I came to see, treatment was inextricably linked to hope, and I suspected that it was her hope, much more than the chemotherapy, that had kept her going years beyond what I would have predicted. But I was the one who had to keep writing orders for the chemotherapy, albeit in low doses, that was keeping her hope, and thus her, alive.Was that so wrong?Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "For Apple, a Search for a Moral High Ground in a Heated Debate", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byDealBookWhat does it mean to be a good corporate citizen?That\u2019s one of the questions being tested as Apple and the federal government battle over whether Apple should help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone to gain access to encrypted data that officials say is necessary for their investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings that killed 14 people.Apple initially assisted the F.B.I., but is now fighting a government order directing it to create a new piece of software to open the phone, contending that its position is meant to protect the privacy of its customers.Aside from the thicket of legal issues raised by the case, does Apple have a moral obligation to help the government learn more about the attack? Or does it have a moral obligation to protect its customers\u2019 privacy? Or how about its shareholders? And which of these should take precedence?Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has long spoken about running his company based on certain values. He has used his position to advocate gay rights, for example, and pushed the company to be more \u201cgreen,\u201d once going so far as to tell a shareholder who questioned the return on investment of taking such stances, \u201cIf you want me to do things only for R.O.I. reasons, you should get out of this stock.\u201dDuring a graduation speech last year at George Washington University, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe believe that a company that has values and acts on them can really change the world.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is opportunity to do work that is infused with moral purpose.\u201dMr. Cook has argued that complying with the court order would threaten \u201ceveryone\u2019s civil liberties\u201d and make customers more vulnerable to digital crime. And Mr. Cook is not alone. Chiefs at several technology companies have supported his position. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic with Apple on this one,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., said on stage Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Apple has come under sharp criticism from law enforcement officials. \u201cThere was once such a thing called corporate responsibility,\u201d William J. Bratton, the police commissioner of New York City, said of Apple. \u201cNow, it\u2019s corporate irresponsibility.\u201dThe debate over Apple\u2019s stance is just the latest in a series of questions about corporate patriotism. In recent years, questions have been directed at companies that renounce their United States citizenship to move to a country with a lower tax rate. Others, including Apple, have faced questions about tax strategies to shelter income abroad. And companies\u2019 social responsibility programs, say for clean energy or water efficiency, have been scrutinized.Behind Mr. Cook\u2019s worry is a separate, perhaps even more immediate threat: the possibility that if Apple were to comply with the court\u2019s order, other governments might follow suit and require Apple to give them access for their own investigative purposes. If Apple refused the request of, say, the Chinese government, it would risk being barred from doing business in China, its second-largest market after the United States.And then there\u2019s the possibility that if Apple were to build special software for the F.B.I., it could fall into the wrong hands, leading to even greater privacy and safety concerns.All of which leads back to the same question: At what point is there a moral obligation for a company to help law enforcement, regardless of the business or privacy risk, in the event of a terrorist attack, or any crime?\u201cWhat are we really doing here? We\u2019re protecting a terrorist,\u201d Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney, told Bloomberg News, referring to Apple\u2019s position. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around that.\u201dAs principled as Mr. Cook\u2019s position may be, it still has the effect of hindering (or at least not helping) a criminal investigation that his company is uniquely situated to assist. (It is worth noting that the government already has most of the material on the phone from a previous backup.)Some business economists like Milton Friedman would most likely argue that Apple has no moral obligation to the government that isn\u2019t in the interest of maximizing its profits.The Justice Department has suggested Apple\u2019s position \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201dJames Comey, the director of the F.B.I., says that this lawsuit presents a narrow legal issue, and that what the government seeks is limited to this particular case.\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation isn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201dYet other law enforcement officials suggest that the conflict with Apple extends far beyond the San Bernardino case.\u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West of technology,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said last Thursday, citing at least 175 iPhones that his office cannot gain access to, and arguing that it should be able to do so. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201dUltimately, it appears that both sides have left little room for compromise. \u201cTim Cook and lawyer Ted Olson have draped their argument in one of moral absolutism \u2014 but there is a hierarchy of moral reasoning they miss,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, referring to Apple\u2019s outside lawyer, Mr. Olson.But if this broader controversy is ever going to be solved for the long term, there has to be an opportunity to reach a consensus in the middle.Maybe that means Apple should work with law enforcement to train officials so they have a better ability to rapidly retrieve information legally? (After all, law enforcement had a chance to gain access to the iPhone in question had they taken certain steps early on.) Or maybe the president should create a commission to study the issue, bringing together people from Silicon Valley and law enforcement to create agreed-upon rules of the road. Or, perhaps new legislation is required.Mr. Comey, in a statement issued Sunday night, suggested as much, citing the need to resolve the \u201ctension between two values we all treasure \u2014 privacy and safety.\u201d\u201cThat tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also should not be resolved by the F.B.I., which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Student Missing After Plane Lands in a Long Island Harbor", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported bySETAUKET, N.Y. \u2014 The police searched on Sunday for a 23-year-old City College student from Queens who was aboard a small plane that made a forced landing in the frigid waters of Setauket Harbor off the North Shore of Long Island after its engine malfunctioned, the authorities said.Three other men who were on the plane, a single-engine Piper Archer, were rescued shortly after it hit the water about 60 miles east of New York City around 11 p.m. on Saturday, according to the Suffolk County police.Two police boats with divers scoured the harbor for the missing man, Gerson Salmon-Negron, through Sunday afternoon, Timothy D. Sini, the Suffolk County police commissioner, said at a waterside news conference. Later, the police said their mission had gone from search-and-rescue to recovery. The operation was suspended after nightfall, to be resumed on Monday morning.Mr. Salmon-Negron, a business student whose LinkedIn page said he also worked for FedEx, expected to graduate in June, said Shara Lazar, a friend who was waiting for word of Mr. Salmon-Negron with relatives and others at the family\u2019s apartment in Elmhurst, Queens.\u201cThis is a very difficult time,\u201d she said, noting that Mr. Salmon-Negron had been on a trip with friends.The other men aboard the plane when it went down were identified by the police as Austricio Ramirez, 25, of the Bronx; Nelson Gomez, 36, of Queens; and Wady Perez, 25, also of Queens. They were treated at Stony Brook University Hospital and released, the police said.The plane left Fitchburg Municipal Airport in Fitchburg, Mass., about 50 miles northwest of Boston, and was heading for Republic Airport in Farmingdale, N.Y., when the engine malfunctioned, the police said. At the time, Mr. Ramirez, a student pilot, was at the controls, the police said. Mr. Gomez, a flight instructor, took over when the trouble started.The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane\u2019s pilot had reported an engine problem shortly before it went down. The agency said the plane was bound for Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma. It was not clear why the local police provided a different destination.The F.A.A. said in its statement that it was investigating and that the National Transportation Safety Board would determine the probable cause of the accident.Jayne Ann Klein, who lives in the hamlet of Strongs Neck on a bluff overlooking the harbor, saw the lights of the plane as it was losing altitude.\u201cHe just kind of glided in, very quiet,\u201d Ms. Klein said. \u201cThere was no big, violent thing. There was no crash.\u201dA short time later, she said, a police officer pulled his cruiser into the family\u2019s driveway. Without saying a word, he jumped out and ran down the backyard steps that led to a beach about 65 feet below.The officer, Charles Scala, said that when he got to the beach he saw a man whose energy appeared to be flagging trying to wade ashore. Officer Scala said he waded out to the man with a life ring and dragged him to safety.Ms. Klein\u2019s husband, George, said he got to the beach in time to help bring the man ashore.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any visible injuries, but he was definitely suffering from hypothermia and shock,\u201d Mr. Klein said. The water temperature was 37 degrees at the time, according to the police.The man wore a white shirt with epaulets, Ms. Klein said. According to Mr. Klein, the man said the plane\u2019s engine had stopped working and that all four people on board had managed to get out of the plane after it hit the water.Other officers responding to the scene commandeered kayaks, apparently from nearby houses.Sgt. Paul Mercready of the county police said he reached one of the men by kayak just as he appeared to be losing consciousness and about to slip underwater. Sergeant Mercready said he removed his belt and looped it through the other man\u2019s belt to keep him close.Mr. Ramirez had documented the flight on Facebook.At 10:42 a.m. Saturday, he posted a picture of himself, along with the words, \u201cPerfect weather to fly.\u201d In the photo, he is wearing a white shirt with epaulets and a necktie. Later, he posted a short video taken from inside the plane. It shows him at the controls as the aircraft is taking off. Another short video shows the plane landing in Boston.At 7:26 p.m. he posted a photo with the words, \u201cAbout to fly back to nyc.\u201dArielle Dollinger reported from Setauket, and William Neuman from New York.

Brush fires of liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I.\u201d  Mr. Paul, 53, a Republican senator from Kentucky and ophthalmologist, finished the Iowa caucuses with 4.5 percent of the vote, a discouraging finish for someone who, just a year earlier, had seemed poised to make a real run at the White House.Though sometimes irascible, Mr. Paul seemed to offer an inclusive vision for the Republican Party, working across the aisle on issues like criminal justice reform and visiting places typically not trafficked by Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 urban centers, liberal-leaning college campuses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to make his pitch.

{"Headline": "America Is Flint", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byBut lead poisoning goes far beyond Flint, and in many parts of America seems to be even worse.\u201cLead in Flint is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d notes Dr. Richard J. Jackson, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cFlint is a teachable moment for America.\u201d\u201cWe are indeed all Flint,\u201d says Dr. Philip Landrigan, a professor of preventive medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cLead poisoning continues to be a silent epidemic in the United States.\u201dNone of this diminishes the tragedy of Flint, which is particularly horrifying because it was delivered by the government through the municipal water system even as state officials scoffed at the local outcry. In any case, data collection is poor, so we don\u2019t have a good handle on the scale of the problem either in Flint or elsewhere: Take comparisons with a grain of salt. But it\u2019s clear that this lead poisoning is not one city\u2019s catastrophe but a nation\u2019s \u2014 and the world\u2019s, since the situation is even worse in some low-income countries.Lead poisoning is an old problem: An Australian doctor, Lockhart Gibson, diagnosed the first case in 1904.Then in 1943, a doctor in Boston encountered a young boy who had tried to stab his teacher, and remembered that the same boy had suffered lead poisoning years earlier. Researchers soon found that early exposure to lead impairs brain development and is strongly associated with later violent or criminal behavior.Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.A first step is to restore funding and to improve lead poisoning screening. When a child tests positive, a public health team should be dispatched to find the source and eliminate it.\u201cEvery urban area has lead,\u201d notes Dr. Leana Wen, the health commissioner of Baltimore. Speaking of efforts to reduce lead poisoning, she said, \u201cIf there\u2019s something we can do that will result in improved educational outcomes and reduced violence in the community, why don\u2019t we do it?\u201dLet\u2019s recognize the catastrophe in Flint as a wake-up call to address not just one city\u2019s lead-poisoning tragedy, but America\u2019s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Princeton Professor Says She Was Handcuffed to Table Over Parking Ticket", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byA black Princeton professor is protesting her arrest during a traffic stop last week, saying she was mistreated because of her race by two white police officers who searched her and handcuffed her to a table.The arrest of Dr. Perry, a professor of African-American studies, and the divergent views of how it was handled have reignited a debate on social media over police tactics and racial profiling.The arrest came after officers stopped Dr. Perry around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday for driving 67 miles per hour in a 45 m.p.h. zone, Capt. Nicholas K. Sutter, the department chief, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.While Dr. Perry said in a message posted online that she was arrested over \u201ca single parking ticket,\u201d Captain Sutter said that the officers who stopped her \u2014 a man and a woman \u2014 learned during a routine check that her driving privileges had been suspended and a warrant had been issued for her arrest over two unpaid parking violations from 2013.\u201cThe warrant commands the officer to take the person into custody,\u201d Captain Sutter said.The officers searched, handcuffed and placed Dr. Perry into a squad car, the captain said. At the police station, she was handcuffed to a workstation and booked. After paying outstanding fines totaling $130, he said, she was released.She said the male officer had performed a \u201cbody search\u201d despite the presence of a female officer, and that she had not been allowed to make a phone call before being placed in the squad car. She was handcuffed to a table at the police station, she said.Dr. Perry said that her accounts of the arrest had drawn abusive comments and suggestions that she had brought it on herself. At the same time, she said, she had also attracted supporters who questioned whether a white suspect would have been treated the same way.She wrote: \u201cThere are a number of commentators online who have repeated to me an all-too-common formulation: \u2018Well, if you hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 But this demand for behavioral perfection from Black people in response to disproportionate policing and punishment is a terrible red herring.\u201dCaptain Sutter, who said he had watched dashboard camera footage of Dr. Perry\u2019s arrest, said it did not show anything unusual. He said the male officer had checked the \u201cexterior portion of her clothing,\u201d meaning Dr. Perry\u2019s jacket pockets and the areas around her shoes.Asked whether the female officer should have searched Dr. Perry, Captain Sutter said department policy did not require that female officers search female suspects. He said it would not be practical because the department had only eight female officers. \u201cWhen we can, we should,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will look at the policy.\u201dDuring the arrest, Captain Sutter said, Dr. Perry asked if she could text someone and was told she could not on the side of the road. Once at the police station, she was handcuffed to the workstation, he said.\u201cEvery single person brought back there is secured while the officer is processing,\u201d he said, adding that exceptions were sometimes made if a suspect was injured in a way that made handcuffing unfeasible.He said he did not know how long Dr. Perry had been handcuffed to the bar, but that the process usually took 15 minutes. Dr. Perry posted bail, and after about an hour at the station she was picked up by someone and left.\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound in any way like I am being defensive or arguing that Dr. Perry is not entitled to feel the way she does,\u201d Captain Sutter said. \u201cWe are part of the larger law enforcement community in our current times in law enforcement. Therefore I understand how in this climate we can be perceived to be a microcosm of that.\u201dDr. Perry said on Facebook that she was keeping the arrest in perspective, and was not comparing it to others that had more dire consequences. But, she added, \u201cI hope that this circle of attention will be part of a deeper reckoning with how and why police officers behave the way they do, especially towards those of us whose flesh is dark.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Exchanges Macy\u2019s for Mixed-Use Giant", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetPITTSBURGH \u2014 A plan to convert Pittsburgh\u2019s 12-story landmark Macy\u2019s department store into a one-million-square-foot mixed-used behemoth has become one of the latest votes of confidence in the decade-long resurgence of the city\u2019s downtown.Core Realty, based in Philadelphia, in July paid $15 million for the property just months before Macy\u2019s closed. The building, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street, dates to the late 1800s and for years was the flagship of the Kaufmann\u2019s department store chain. It went through several expansions and renovations, including a heralded Art Deco interior makeover of the first floor in 1930.Randy Mineo, executive vice president of Core Realty and a Pittsburgh native, envisions a mix of retailers, restaurants and entertainment spots to complement a 155-room Even Hotel and 312 luxury apartments. Named the Grand at Fifth Avenue, the estimated $100 million project will feature an open-air atrium beginning on the fifth floor and 600 parking spaces, a sparse commodity downtown.\u201cI\u2019ve always looked at Pittsburgh as a hidden gem; it\u2019s a city that has been kind of ignored,\u201d said Mr. Mineo, who with the owner of Core Realty, Michael Samschick, began hunting for properties in the city three years ago. \u201cBut you could tell that underneath the surface, Pittsburgh was bubbling.\u201dDevelopers, corporations, educators and others have pumped about $5 billion into the city\u2019s downtown, also called the Golden Triangle, over the last decade, according to the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.Investors have converted old office buildings into residential units, hotels and classrooms, constructed new office buildings, and built up the district\u2019s restaurant and entertainment base, even while the state has overseen the city\u2019s budget as a result of Pittsburgh\u2019s near-bankruptcy early this century.Among other projects, Millcraft Investments, a developer based in nearby Washington, Pa., which evolved from the industrialist Jack B. Piatt\u2019s business interests, converted seven historic buildings in 2010 into Market Square Place, a $42 million project that houses a Y.M.C.A., retailers and 46 loft apartments.And Millcraft is putting the final touches on its newly constructed $108 million Gardens at Market Square, a mixed-use development that offers a 197-room Hilton Garden Inn, office and retail space, and a garage for 330 cars.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much activity in Pittsburgh,\u201d said Lucas B. Piatt, president and chief operating officer of Millcraft. \u201cIt\u2019s not down on itself anymore.\u201dAbout five years ago, national office investors for the first time took notice of the market after vacancies actually fell and rental rates grew amid the financial turbulence in 2008 and 2009, said Jason T. Stewart, an executive vice president with the brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle in Pittsburgh.That was, in part, because of fortunate circumstances, Mr. Stewart said. The regulator-encouraged acquisition by PNC of the beleaguered National City Mortgage, as well as the merger between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, brought thousands of workers downtown.\u201cAfter the dust settled in 2010, the fundamentals in Pittsburgh looked very favorable,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in 2011, office trades started happening.\u201dClass A office space downtown now has an average vacancy rate of about 7.5 percent, although rental rates remained relatively flat in 2015 and coming lease expirations will put more space in older buildings on the market, according to Jones Lang.Nevertheless, building conversions have cut into office supply and little new construction is underway or planned, which is fostering an environment for rent increases, said Dan Adamski, a managing director with the brokerage.Shorenstein, an office landlord based in San Francisco, made its first acquisition in Pittsburgh last month, paying $149 million for the 45-story One Oxford Centre. It plans to update the property, which is about 20 percent vacant.\u201cIn downtown Pittsburgh, 20 percent vacancy is considered high,\u201d said Matthew M. Knisely, a managing director with Shorenstein. \u201cMost Class A towers are very well leased, and we expect the same thing at One Oxford Centre.\u201dIn addition to the promising office market conditions, the decisions of Google, Uber, Apple and Oculus, owned by Facebook, to put operations in Pittsburgh grabbed Shorenstein\u2019s attention, as did the tech start-ups emerging from nearby Carnegie Mellon University, he said. Much of that activity stems from the city\u2019s longstanding strategy to build up its academic, medical and technological base.The growing population in the downtown area \u2014 up 10 percent to more than 12,300 residents since 2010 \u2014 also appealed to Shorenstein. The housing supply in the downtown area has ballooned nearly 50 percent to more than 5,300 units since 2000, and the average occupancy is about 95 percent, according to estimates by the downtown partnership group. An additional 3,875 units are under construction or planned.Conversation among developers and civic leaders is increasingly focusing on how to improve the Golden Triangle\u2019s shopping experience and whether the area population alone can support conventional retailers. Mr. Piatt, for example, doubts that suburbanites will trek downtown to frequent stores already situated close to home.Restaurants, entertainment venues and boutiques have replaced four department stores as the Golden Triangle\u2019s retail anchors, said Herky Pollock, executive vice president and northeast director of the retail services group for the brokerage company CBRE in the city. But he suggested that the bustling restaurant scene and the growing number of young workers living downtown was generating interest among a variety of operators, from discount retailers like T. J. Maxx to large fitness facilities.\u201cAs long as we add unique offerings, downtown will prosper beyond where it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Pollock said.Still, Macy\u2019s closing in September left a gaping hole along Smithfield Street, once the city\u2019s most vibrant retail corridor, and has put Core Realty\u2019s redevelopment plan under a microscope. Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., president of the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, wants to see retailing dominate Smithfield Street again.His organization led opposition to the plan by a former mayor, Thomas J. Murphy Jr., to replace 64 buildings on 4.5 acres with a mall in the 1990s. In addition to initiatives like protecting old building facades, the foundation has renovated a handful of properties to create space for apartments, clothing stores, a grocer and other shops, generally charging rental rates below the market average.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned whether people will live downtown if they have to leave downtown to shop,\u201d Mr. Ziegler said. \u201cThe Macy\u2019s project is going to be very important. We need it full of shops or that street won\u2019t come back for retail.\u201dMacy\u2019s initially wanted to take part in the renovation and stay on four floors but couldn\u2019t make it work financially, Mr. Mineo said. Instead, he is planning 100,000 square feet of shops, restaurants and entertainment on the first two floors, as well as a rooftop restaurant.The inability to substantially increase the number of entrances into the landmark will require Core Realty to woo larger users, however, and junior apparel stores, supermarkets and entertainment concepts like Lucky Strike bowling are among his targets.\u201cWe need people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that with all the apartments that are here and those that are coming, we\u2019ll have enough to support the project.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Mention of \u2018Birther\u2019 Debate as Donald Trump Woos Blacks in South Carolina", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Donald J. Trump, looking to amass as many votes as possible in the South Carolina primary, is increasingly trying to appeal to the state\u2019s black voters. In doing so, he appears to hope that any  memory of his 2011 demand to see the birth certificate of the nation\u2019s first black president is a distant one. At a news conference on Monday in South Carolina, where residents can vote in either party\u2019s primary, Mr. Trump handled a question about undocumented immigrants, many of whom are Hispanic, by bemoaning the plight of African-Americans under President Obama. \u201cI\u2019m a unifier,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cObama is not a unifier.\u201d The candidate whose campaign pillar has been taking a hard line on undocumented immigrants and who has used caustic language about Mexicans turned to a woman who asked him about \u201cDreamers,\u201d the term used for children of undocumented immigrants who were not brought to the country of their own volition. \u201cI want dreamers to come from this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou mentioned Dreamers,\u201d he added. \u201cI want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also. They\u2019re not dreaming.\u201d He quickly added, \u201cYou look at African-American youth \u2014 I mean, 58 percent unemployment.\u201d \u201cWe have an African-American president and he has not done anything for the African-Americans in this country, and he got a free pass and he shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause if that was me, or if it was somebody else, we would be, we would be taken over the coals, believe me.\u201d He went on: \u201cYou look at African-Americans that are 30 years old, 40 years old, 50 years old. Take a look at their statistics, it\u2019s very sad.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes of appealing to black voters was clear in an ad he began running in the state on Friday evening, featuring an endorsement from Jamiel Shaw Sr., a black man whose 17-year-old son, Jas, was killed in Los Angeles almost a decade ago by an undocumented immigrant. Mr. Trump has mentioned the case repeatedly, and Mr. Shaw has made campaign appearances with the candidate. The ad features a picture of Jas and one of his killer. The outcry over Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary comments has focused almost entirely around his remarks about immigration and Mexicans since announcing his campaign in June. He has almost entirely avoided discussing the \u201cbirther\u201d claim he rode to great effect against Mr. Obama five years ago. He found a new target for his questions of presidential legitimacy in Senator Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada and whom Mr. Trump has threatened to sue. This shift in focus has in effect eroded the memories of his claims over Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. Trump has also long believed, aides said, that he will do better among black voters than people think. In Manchester, N.H., last Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, predicted his boss would do well in South Carolina, previewing the strategy. \u201cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget: There is no party registration, anybody can go in and vote,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said, adding that the campaign was already doing voter-identification calls to try to identify potential black supporters in the state. \u201cWhether you guys believe it or not, Trump does well, exceptionally well, with the African-American population.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Staying Healthy While Traveling the Globe", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.On a recent trip to Tanzania with four grandsons, my most important task (beside protecting them from the jaws of a lion or leopard) was to keep them, and myself, in good health. It would not have been much fun to be stuck in a tent next to the commode or flattened on a cot while the rest of the gang viewed a dazzling array of wild animals from the safety of a Land Rover.Although I came prepared for the worst, I did everything I could to make our trip the best. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to report, no one got sick and we all had a great time.When I described the steps I took to friends and physicians, they urged me to write about them. So here goes, along with a host of other helpful travel hints from well-informed professional sources.No. 1: I reminded my grandsons daily, any water you drink or use to brush your teeth must come from a sealed bottle that you open. Ice wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an issue in the bush, but that too should be prepared from bottled water. When you take a shower or swim in a pool, keep your mouth shut. (This warning was particularly pertinent for one grandson who always sings in the shower.)No. 2: Before every meal, we each chewed one pink tablet of bismuth subsalicylate (sold as Pepto-Bismol and various store brands).I have relied on these tablets, albeit in a lesser dose because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a lot smaller than average, during trips to Vietnam, Thailand, Peru, Indonesia, India and Nepal, and never got sick despite eating salads and peeled fruit, which one is warned to avoid. In fact, in India and Nepal, my traveling companion, who also took the tablets, and I were the only ones who stayed healthy even though the others in our group assiduously avoided those no-no foods and we did not.So for the five of us going to Tanzania, I packed 15 tablets for each day of our trip \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and no one experienced the slightest gastrointestinal upset. That wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case, though, for most of the others on our itinerary. However, if you choose to try this preventive, I suggest you check first with your doctor and perhaps consider using Dr. DuPont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s larger dosage.Without a preventive, which is no guarantee against food-borne illness, stick to \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe food\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is cooked and served hot, and fruits and vegetables you have washed in bottled water and peeled yourself. Never eat undercooked foods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 eggs, meat, fish or poultry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or any food sold by street vendors.Reduce your exposure to germs by washing your hands often, and always before eating. A hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol can be used if soap and water are unavailable.I took no chances, especially since I was responsible for four children. I had an emergency supply of Lomotil (for digestive problems) and azithromycin (Zithromax Z-pak, for infections) just in case.I also packed an ample supply of sunscreen, insect repellent with 20 percent or more of DEET, and a first-aid kit of hydrocortisone cream, antibiotic ointment and a variety of bandages, though happily the latter two were never needed. For one grandson prone to motion sickness, I took some meclizine as well.As the oldest traveler in the group (and the shortest now that my youngest grandson, at age 11, has passed me), I am acutely aware of the risk of blood clots when flying long distances. I always book an aisle seat so I can get up every hour or so and walk around for a minute. It also helps to move your legs and flex your ankles frequently. You might also wear graduated compression stockings on very long trips. Similar precautions apply to long car or train trips.Even when traveling alone, I always purchase travel health and medical evacuation insurance because, well, you never know. People on my various trips have broken bones or become seriously ill and had to return home mid-trip. Two men died while snorkeling on separate trips of mine.Consider carrying a card that lists your blood type, any chronic illnesses or serious allergies and the generic names of prescription medicines you take. Bring some extra doses in case of travel delays.Other worthy precautions: To avoid nasty parasitic diseases like schistosomiasis, do not swim or wade in fresh water in developing countries or wherever the sanitation is poor. Pools should be chlorinated. However adorable an animal (domestic or wild) may be, keep your distance. Do not touch or feed any animal you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. Some carry rabies. Should you get bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the wound immediately with soap and clean water and, if at all possible, get to a doctor quickly.If you expect to be at a high altitude (8,000 feet or higher), consult your doctor about medicine to prevent altitude sickness, which can take more than the starch out of a person. I was glad I did when traveling to Cusco, Peru (11,154 feet) and climbing in the Sacred Valley of the Incas (9,000 feet). The recommended preventive is acetazolamide (generic version of Diamox).Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Some political analysts suggested that he might have damaged his standing with Republicans by loudly criticizing former President George W. Bush for failing to keep Americans safe on Sept. 11, 2001, and for bungling the Iraq war.The NBC News/W.S.J. poll noted that its sample of 400 Republican primary voters consisted of more people who consider themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery conservative\u00e2\u0080\u009d than its January poll.

Ms. Schwartz quickly responded, and after a brief exchange, Ms. Brock purchased the postcard-size painting.That was three years ago, and Ms. Brock, who lives in Stamford, Conn., and Ms. Schwartz, a painter in Santa Monica, Calif., have never met in person. But each has been part of the other\u2019s community of artists on Facebook. And both suffer from bouts of insomnia, which has often left them working in their studios or browsing social media when most other people are asleep.\u201cIt\u2019s a different mind-set when you\u2019re awake and in your studio late at night,\u201d Ms. Brock said last month during the show\u2019s opening reception, which was attended by many of the artists. \u201cYou\u2019re letting your subconscious happen. You\u2019re doodling, dabbling, and things emerge.\u201dCommenting on this proliferation, Ms. Mojzsis said, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to work smaller when you\u2019re exhausted, and you end up continuing on from one to the next.\u201d\u201cI paint the same thing over and over, but every night it\u2019s different,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cIt becomes a bit of a meditation.\u201dMeditation was the word that several of the artists in the \u201cInsomnia\u201d exhibition used when discussing their middle-of-the-night practices. Others said they were driven by restlessness, anxiety or obsession. Ms. King said: \u201cIt\u2019s unplanned and intuitive. I pick up a pencil or a piece of charcoal and start doing stuff.\u201dMs. Brock said the small gouache paintings she created when she should have been asleep were explorations. \u201cI play around,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m way more risk-taking with color.\u201dNearly 100 of those pieces hang together in the gallery, bold, bright and animated. More are stacked in her studio. \u201cI put them together and turn them upside-down,\u201d Ms. Brock said. \u201cI use them for inspiration.\u201dAcross the gallery, 116 of Ms. Schwartz\u2019s paintings are arranged in columns and rows, gouaches she has been making in what she called her \u201cnight studio\u201d since 2012. One section of the display contains abstract compositions like the piece by the entrance, their palettes shifting from peachy tones to yellow to blue. In an email, Ms. Schwartz said the series was \u201cabout color and mark-making\u201d and \u201cmaybe more lighthearted than I normally work.\u201dA second grouping of newer gouaches depicts figures in various postures of agitation or despair, a reflection of personal challenges Ms. Schwartz had recently faced. \u201cThey convey some states of being that I experienced in the months of loss,\u201d she wrote, citing grief, emptiness, dissociation and grasping. \u201cPainting is how I am trying to make sense of my situation.\u201dMost of his 16 drawings in \u201cInsomnia\u201d are of Ms. King, with whom he lives in Brooklyn. \u201cI like to put on a DVD at the end of the day and draw while the movie is playing,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually Anki falls asleep and I wind up making drawings of her.\u201dThere she is, eyes closed, on her back under a blanket, or on her side with an arm draped across her chest.

He draws with ink, and there is evidence of false starts. \u201cIt\u2019s an indelible mark,\u201d he said, \u201clike being a tightrope walker without a net.\u201dMr. Mitchell said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I suffer from insomnia because I\u2019m not suffering. I\u2019m just so excited about my work that I don\u2019t want to waste any time.\u201dParadoxically, Mr. Rohlf, of Brooklyn, mentioned light. \u201cPeople talk about natural light,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to click on two spotlights and work at a tabletop, the intimacy is a luxury, especially in New York.\u201dHe said he enjoyed a form of creative disorientation at night. \u201cYou lose your bearings and your sense of time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wake up in the morning and think, \u2018What happened last night?\u2019\u201dMs. Brock said the work in \u201cInsomnia\u201d was not what the participating artists would normally exhibit. Most of the artwork is unframed, mounted with magnets. A compelling energy runs through the exhibition, a sense of vitality, as if the pieces are clamoring to be seen.\u201cThis is the work they do for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t intentional, because it is.

Almost as soon as you proclaim your intention to learn French or cut out carbs, the world moves on, leaving you with only your empty promises and scone crumbs on your shirt.This year is no different. Even though Mr. Zuckerberg probably has his hands full with his company and a new baby, he has said he will run 365 miles over the course of the year and build an artificial intelligence butler for his home.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s efforts have made him the object of fascination and emulation among a subset of millennials in and around the tech industry. More than seeing Mr. Zuckerberg as merely an avatar of tech success and unfathomable wealth, they consider him a role model.\u201cI run three experiments each year inspired by Zuckerberg,\u201d said Dave Fontenot, 22, a San Francisco resident who used to be an agent for engineers, but who said he is currently \u201cfocusing on myself.\u201dThis year, Mr. Fontenot aims to improve his posture, meditate and spend more time alone. He also trained himself to send thank-you notes, either handwritten or as voice recordings via text, inspired by Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cFor a period of time, I wasn\u2019t thanking people at all, but then, for one of the most powerful person in the world to do it, I was like, wow,\u201d Mr. Fontenot said.In 2012, Mr. Fontenot was invited to Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., after winning a hackathon at the University of Michigan. There, he had a chance to see Mr. Zuckerberg up close.Mr. Fontenot remembered a moment when Mr. Zuckerberg spotted someone juggling and expressed a desire to try it. \u201cIn 20 minutes, he kind of learned it,\u201d Mr. Fontenot said.Lukas Biewald, a co-founder and the C.E.O. of CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing company in San Francisco, sees Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s efforts at self-betterment, maybe even including juggling, as emblematic of the tech industry as a whole. \u201cI think taking on self-improvement projects outside of work is part of the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Biewald, 34. \u201cPeople expect you to have things that you care about outside of work.\u201dFor John Mills, 33, a woodworker and a co-founder of Zenput, a mobile work-tracking company, that means internal and external initiatives. \u201cI\u2019ve actually started meditating and yoga,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to get involved in nonprofit work, started to donate more of my time and money and resources to nonprofits I believe in.\u201dTo Erik Zuuring, 26, a designer and developer in Montreal, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s self-improvement offers permission to develop mastery outside of technology. \u201cI see these self-improvement things from Zuckerberg as a way to say, \u2018You don\u2019t have to always rely on computers, you can do things without distractions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zuuring said.\u201cI became a vegetarian and found ways to exercise, take an hour to play guitar or read a book,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what Zuckerberg is trying to get people to do, too. It\u2019s inspiring, but in some sense it\u2019s weird, coming from Facebook.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve looked at the list of many things he\u2019s done and followed many of the same paths,\u201d said Ben Tauber, the 32-year-old founder of Velocity, a platform that connects people to personal and professional coaches. \u201cI have a personal meditation practice, paid attention to my food, killed my own chickens.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve really appreciated is the transformation I\u2019ve seen Mark go through from the outside, how he communicated what his values were when he was 24, 26, to what his values are now,\u201d Mr. Tauber said.That transformation didn\u2019t always seem inevitable. The early public perception of the once-20-something C.E.O. was as an emotionless carbon-based offshoot of the Internet itself.The few rote-seeming interviews Mr. Zuckerberg has given over the years have only served to confirm the assumption that he is more machine than man. That may be why his annual announcements sometimes have the feel of software upgrades. (Mr. Zuckerberg, through a spokeswoman, declined to speak about his yearly challenges, citing time constraints.)\u201cSomewhere along the line he\u2019s changed into the aspirational model in chief,\u201d said Tom Junod, Esquire\u2019s writer at large, who profiled the press-shy Mr. Zuckerberg for the magazine using only publicly available quotes. \u201cI think it\u2019s when he started doing these self-improvement projects.\u201d In his elusive subject, Mr. Junod discovered \u201cthe most interesting boring person in the world or the most boring interesting one.\u201dNot everyone in the tech field is a Zuckerberg acolyte. Max Nanis, a 25-year-old computational biologist (\u201cYou\u2019d call me a \u2018brogrammer,\u2019\u201d he said) from the La Jolla section of San Diego, compared some of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s public pronouncements and peekaboo social media presence to those of the Kardashians.\u201cThe way he acts is no different than a 20-year-old model on Instagram,\u201d Mr. Nanis said. \u201cHe knows he has influence. That\u2019s how I read a lot of those messages.\u201d (Perhaps, but unlike any of those models, Mr. Zuckerberg acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012.)\u201cI\u2019m sure people aspire to be Mark Zuckerberg when they grow up,\u201d Mr. Nanis said. But, he said, \u201cPeople that need role models for very rudimentary behaviors for taking care of themselves probably have other problems to deal with.\u201d\u201cNo single person can rewrite a social norm, but if one influential person lets it be known that even at the pinnacle of success one ought to reassess life, that\u2019s a good influence,\u201d said Steven Pinker, 61, the Harvard professor whose \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined\u201d was one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s book club picks.\u201cHe seems to be closer to setting an example than preaching or proselytizing,\u201d Mr. Pinker said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a manifesto from him or a splashy aspirational statement from him.\u201dAfter selecting Mr. Pinker\u2019s book, Mr. Zuckerberg invited the professor to the Facebook campus and to dinner at his house in Palo Alto, Calif. Also in attendance were Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s wife, Priscilla Chan, and several Facebook executives. The meal was catered; Mr. Pinker said he wasn\u2019t sure if Mr. Zuckerberg had slaughtered any of the animals himself.\u201cIt was pleasant,\u201d Mr. Pinker said. \u201cHe\u2019s nonpretentious, intellectually curious, eager to learn and interact.\u201dDid Mr. Pinker send a thank-you note afterward?\u201cI have to confess that I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a resolution I should adopt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What does Robert Mapplethorpe have left for us?A lot, it turns out.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis ideas of physical perfection in the models and subjects, his ideals of perfection in the photographic print, even on a kind of bigger scale, what were the career pinnacles that he was aiming for, be they certain kinds of gallery representation, retrospective exhibitions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Britt Salvesen, the department head and curator of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department and the Department of Prints and Drawings at Lacma. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe really was dedicated to that goal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAn exploration of stories on the L.G.B.T.Q. community previously published on Lens.Mapplethorpe is perhaps best known for his images of the gay bondage scene of the 1970s in downtown New York, where he was both participant and observer. He found many of the men who became part of his iconic \u00e2\u0080\u009cX Portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u009d during forays to the Mineshaft, the notorious bar and sex club that was the seedy heart of the boundary-breaking, taboo-flouting fringes of the downtown gay scene. His images were revolutionary, both for the radically inclusive nature of their subjects, and for their meticulous execution: He photographed gay men at a time when it was impolitic to do so and he did so in an exquisitely formal way.These days, when gay marriage is legal, gayness a part of mainstream culture and pornography \u00e2\u0080\u0094 actual pornography, not fastidiously lit and posed images that are merely sexually explicit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is readily available, Mapplethorpe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images are as necessary as ever. As Patti Smith, his longtime co-conspirator wrote in \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust Kids,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her memoir of their time together, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe worked without apology, investing the homosexual with grandeur, masculinity and enviable nobility.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut the most striking aspect of the BDSM images is the way they presaged the combination of aching elegance and obsessive attention to detail that became his signature. Even as he moved from leather to lilies, there was no mistaking a Mapplethorpe for a nude or still life by anyone else, so luxuriant and unrepentant were his images.Yet, he had not intended to become a photographer. He studied drawing, painting and sculpture at the Pratt Institute, and in the first half of the 1970s he made collages and sculptures out of found objects and imagery from gay porn magazines. He took photographs to create images for these projects, and increasingly found himself drawn to the craft, encouraged by his lover and longtime mentor Sam Wagstaff. But he chafed against photography\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-class standing in the visual arts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he aspired to greatness, and being the best at a lesser art would not do.So he made images that could not be ignored. After the \u00e2\u0080\u009cX Portfolio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on to make scores of portraits of celebrities like Iggy Pop and Carolina Herrera as well as people involved in the arts during the 1980s: John McKendry, Meredith Monk, Grace Jones and others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho else photographed all these famous people from the New York art scene at that time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paul Martineau, the associate curator of photographs at the Getty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really an important document of that world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also embarked on a collaboration with the body builder Lisa Lyon, creating dozens of images that subvert ideas about what the female body should look like. Obsessed with the sculptural nature of bodies and forms, he made dramatic, richly physical images of flowers and male nudes. Fittingly, Mapplethorpe\u2019s work has been hung alongside sculptures by Auguste Rodin in the Grand Palais in Paris and shown alongside masterpieces by Michelangelo in Italy.But even that later work was not without controversy. His search for the platonic ideal of the human form led him to create hundreds of images of nude black men. Phallocentric and often anonymous, the work, published as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Black Book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was decried for objectifying and dehumanizing its subjects. Glenn Ligon, an artist whose work is deeply concerned with perceptions and depictions of blackness and sexuality in the mainstream, mounted a response in exhibition form: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotes on the Margin of the Black Book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which he paired pages of Mapplethorpe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book with critiques and notes on blackness (and queerness) from thinkers like James Baldwin and even the longtime Mapplethorpe subject Ken Moody.As with all things Mapplethorpe, the truth lies somewhere between the black and white. He named many of his subjects in the image titles, and often asked his subjects how they would like to be seen. At the Getty show, which features a photograph of a black man seen from behind and posed on a pedestal, we find that the subject, Phillip Prioleau, asked to be photographed in that way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe asked me how I wanted to be photographed, and I told him I had always wanted to be photographed on a pedestal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMapplethorpe died in 1989 of AIDS, just months after the major retrospective of his work, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Perfect Moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d opened in Philadelphia. Looking through his work now, the photographs are shaded by the knowledge that the hedonism and exaltation he captured would soon be brutally truncated by a disease characterized as much by wasting away as his images are by their brio."}
{"Headline": "Nikki Haley Endorses Marco Rubio, Aiming to Project Vibrant New G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byCHAPIN, S.C. \u2014 Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday won the coveted backing of South Carolina\u2019s governor, Nikki R. Haley, bringing together two of the youngest Republican rising stars at a moment when their party is facing difficult questions about whether instead to look to its past or to political outsiders for leadership.Coming just three days before the South Carolina presidential primary, Ms. Haley\u2019s endorsement could provide Mr. Rubio with a crucial lift on Saturday. But it may also help him beyond, by associating him with a widely admired leader who, as a woman and a minority figure, shatters traditional perceptions of a Republican politician.Together, the two 44-year-olds \u2014 Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants; Ms. Haley, the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India \u2014 hope to form a powerful contrast to an older generation of Republicans who have long controlled the party and are loath to relinquish power.\u201cI wanted somebody that was going to go and show my parents that the best decision they ever made was coming to America,\u201d Ms. Haley, explaining why she had picked Mr. Rubio, told more than 500\u00a0enthusiastic, sign-waving supporters who stood in the cold outside a warehouse for an evening rally here.Mr. Rubio is counting on Ms. Haley\u2019s embrace to draw a bold line under his campaign promises of ushering in a new era of conservatism led by younger, optimistic leaders.\u201cWe have to win. Not just this election \u2014 we have to win the future,\u201d he told the evening crowd in Chapin. \u201cWe have an incredible opportunity not just to unite the conservative movement but to grow it, to take our message to people that don\u2019t vote for us now, to people that for 25 years have been told the Republican Party only cares about the rich people.\u201dSpeaking to reporters as he campaigned outside Charleston \u2014 at a country club, which seemed only to accentuate the generational divide \u2014 Mr. Bush tried to remain upbeat, but said he was unhappy nonetheless at Ms. Haley\u2019s decision.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cShe\u2019s a very good governor. And should I win the nomination, there will be a role for her in the campaign, trust me.\u201dFor Mr. Rubio, who is eager to put behind him an embarrassing fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Ms. Haley\u2019s endorsement could provide a much-needed jolt.And it seemed to bolster what Mr. Rubio\u2019s aides had been saying privately for the last several days: that the Florida senator was climbing to finish in third place, if not in second place, here on Saturday.The tightening dynamics of the race were also evident on Wednesday in the sometimes bitter, sometimes bizarre tones of the other Republican contenders.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is second in most polls here, found himself under furious assault from two sides, with Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump, who leads in the South Carolina polls, accusing Mr. Cruz of running a dishonest campaign and of deploying sleazy last-minute tricks, like push polls and Facebook posts to deceive voters. Mr. Trump has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Cruz campaign demanding it pull an ad that quoted Mr. Trump saying in 1999 that he was \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201dMr. Cruz, rattled and visibly agitated at having his credibility impugned by two rivals he believes have taken their own liberties with his record, assailed both men at length in a news conference on Wednesday. He called Mr. Rubio \u201cDonald Trump with a smile.\u201d His retort to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit threat: Sue me.\u201cI may well not use outside counsel,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, a lawyer who has argued cases before the Supreme Court. \u201cI may take the deposition myself.\u201dIn a statement after Mr. Cruz\u2019s remarks, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cruz a liar and threatened legal action over a separate alleged offense: his contention that Mr. Cruz\u2019s Canadian birth disqualifies him from being president.A look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.\u201cIf I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural-born Canadian, I will do so,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding mockingly, \u201cTime will tell, Teddy.\u201dMr. Rubio seemed content to leave the lawyers out of his feud with Mr. Cruz. But he, too, assailed Mr. Cruz\u2019s integrity, saying that tactics like a phony post on Facebook, depicting Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina renouncing his endorsement of Mr. Rubio, showed Mr. Cruz\u2019s lack of character. (Mr. Cruz repeatedly denied he had anything to do with the post.)\u201cIt does reflect the kind of campaign you\u2019re running and what you\u2019re capable and willing to do in order to win,\u201d Mr. Rubio told reporters at a stop in Mount Pleasant on Wednesday morning. \u201cTed, unfortunately, has proven that he\u2019s willing to say or do anything to get elected.

Trump drew another of his massive crowds Friday night in Tampa, where he boasted of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a developer and job creator in Florida. It was a preview of the argument he will no doubt use to strip support from the state\u2019s two home-grown candidates, Jeb Bush, the former governor, and Senator Marco Rubio.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent a lot of money in Florida, nobody else has,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created tremendous numbers of jobs down here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099He spoke of properties he developed in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties and emphasized that many of the workers were Hispanic, an effort to mitigate his harsh stance against illegal immigration.    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Hispanics love me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump maintained.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd by the way, by the way, by the way, today I just settled with Univision.

He told of driving down the $170 million price he agreed to even after signing a contract. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said listen fellas, \u2018I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to pay 170,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u2019The place is in lousy condition.

{"Headline": "Congresswoman\u2019s Long Quest: Bringing Pandas to New York", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byIt is an obsession that has taken her to the other side of the world, one that has turned casual conversations into arm-twisting negotiations, and innocuous radio chitchat into a stealth attack on the mayor of New York.And yet, Ms. Maloney has been undeterred.Her efforts carry all the marks of a lawmaker practiced in the art of hardball, and illustrate the surprising forms political advocacy can take.Needing the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, Ms. Maloney castigated him on the radio, declaring on a program on WNYM-AM last winter that the mayor plainly \u201cdoesn\u2019t like pandas.\u201d She won the backing of another Democrat, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who often jousts with Mr. de Blasio.Her office sent letter after letter to Chinese officials soliciting support, and in summer 2014 she traveled to China to visit a panda preserve in Chengdu.And in a fund-raising coup, Ms. Maloney recently secured the support of Maurice R. Greenberg, the billionaire former chairman of A.I.G., who has agreed to help gather money for the project. Mr. Greenberg said he will host a breakfast in March to help initiate a fund-raising campaign for a panda exhibit.\u201cOur city,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cwould benefit in numerous ways from this project.\u201dBut the congresswoman\u2019s enthusiasm for pandas is deeply personal, she said, dating back decades to when one of her young daughters aspired to become a panda scientist. That daughter is now in business school.Ms. Maloney, 69, said she had found that pandas have a unique power to bring people together. She recalled, for instance, a tense meeting with Chinese officials after NATO forces inadvertently bombed China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade in 1999, during the war in Yugoslavia.The coiled tension in the room eased, she said, only after she \u201cfinally broke the ice with pandas.\u201dDavid Towne, the chairman of the United States-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, said a project of the scale envisioned in New York would require \u201csupport at the $50 million level.\u201dMr. Towne, who said he had spoken with Ms. Maloney, warned that even if backers raised that much money, a New York panda project would face uncertain prospects, given that zoos in Atlanta, Memphis, San Diego and Washington already have giant pandas on display.\u201cChina has been very vocal in saying, no more pandas to North America, or to the U.S., specifically,\u201d Mr. Towne said.For those reasons and others, Ms. Maloney has faced deep skepticism from officials in City Hall and conservation leaders in New York. An initial proposal to bring pandas to the Central Park Zoo foundered after she grudgingly conceded that the zoo did not have the necessities required for a panda habitat \u2014 as zoo officials had insisted all along.In fall 2014, Ms. Maloney\u2019s office drafted a letter, directed at Chinese officials, for the mayor to sign. City Hall left it without a signature for over a year \u2014 a particular sticking point, since China would not consider lending pandas to the city without Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support.At times, Ms. Maloney\u2019s indifference to the obstacles in her path has generated friction on its own. In summer 2014, a senior official at the conservation society appealed to City Hall, writing in an email that things had reached \u201ca new level of absurdity\u201d as Ms. Maloney intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo.\u201cI think a statement saying that we appreciate her passion but we are not interested in pandas would be helpful,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cClearly she doesn\u2019t hear it when we say it to her respectfully.\u201dNevertheless, Ms. Maloney received a message in October from the Chinese ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, agreeing that China\u2019s forestry authorities would enter preliminary talks with New York and would \u201cconsider the formal initiation of cooperation when conditions are mature.\u201dAt the white-tie Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in November, Ms. Maloney cornered Mr. de Blasio to further plead her case, and this time she brought reinforcement: John A. Catsimatidis, the billionaire political donor and owner of the supermarket chain Gristedes.Gradually, Ms. Maloney and her negotiating partners approached a point of consensus. City Hall agreed to sign her letter, with the understanding that private funds would be required, and that the 265-acre Bronx Zoo would be a more appropriate site.Ms. Maloney has also smoothed relations with the conservation society, and agreed during her visit to the Bronx Zoo to back a bill the group supports, designating the bison as the nation\u2019s official mammal.Mr. Catsimatidis, a candidate in 2013 for the Republican nomination for mayor, said he intended to lead a fund-raising drive and estimated that he could collect the money for a panda exhibit in 90 days.More support has come from an even less likely source: the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican and a zoo enthusiast, who said in an email that New York would benefit from \u201cthese remarkable animals.\u201d\u201cSurely the greatest American city ought to have pandas,\u201d Mr. Gingrich wrote.Ms. Maloney said she felt closer than ever to her ultimate aim. She said she envisioned a bamboo forest upstate, to secure a reliable food supply for the pandas, and she has begun to brainstorm what kind of animals New York could give to China as a token of appreciation and cultural exchange.\u201cMaybe,\u201d she mused, \u201cthe upstate deer are so sweet, and they\u2019re sort of a symbol of peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Prosecutors Will Move to Dismiss Charges in Brownsville Rape Case", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byProsecutors in Brooklyn plan on moving to dismiss first-degree rape charges against all five teenagers accused of attacking an 18-year-old woman on a playground in Brownsville, Brooklyn, in January, officials said on Wednesday.Almost from the moment the explosive allegations were made public, the case was dogged by questions about the accounts by the woman and her father, who later admitted they had been having sex in the park that night, and about the city\u2019s handling of the case, which was criticized as being too slow.The woman gave several conflicting accounts of what had occurred on Jan. 7 in Osborn Playground, two law enforcement officials said. The father admitted that the assailants had not had a gun, as he had initially told the police. And in recent days, the woman has told prosecutors that she was unwilling to testify or otherwise cooperate further with the investigation, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public.So, even as prosecutors learned more about the young woman\u2019s deeply troubled childhood in foster care, they decided that the case could not go forward, and on Wednesday, the Brooklyn district attorney, Ken Thompson, said that he would ask the court to dismiss the charges.\u201cThat night, this young woman\u2019s father and the five young men engaged in conduct that was reprehensible and wrong, but because of the lack of reliable evidence, criminal charges simply cannot be sustained,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in a statement.The charges will be dismissed with prejudice, which means prosecutors are precluded from reinstating the charges even if additional evidence emerges.Lawyers for the five men embraced Mr. Thompson\u2019s decision, calling it a relief to their clients and their families. But they expressed differing views on his language regarding the conduct of the teenagers that night as \u201creprehensible and wrong.\u201d\u201cI have great respect for him, but I respectfully disagree with that characterization he put forth there,\u201d said Spencer Leeds, the lawyer for one of the young men, Onandi Brown. \u201cI don\u2019t view Onandi\u2019s conduct at any time as being reprehensible, based on our investigation of the case.\u201dA lawyer for another, Abdula R. Greene, who represented Ethan Philips, called the district attorney\u2019s statement \u201ca little bit of a smear on their character.\u201dBut Ken Montgomery, a lawyer for Denzel Murray, another of the teenagers, did not find fault with the choice of words. \u201cI think that is a way, from a policy and social standpoint, to say, \u2018Young men should exercise a little bit better judgment in dealing with certain things,\u2019 but what they did didn\u2019t rise to criminality,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said. \u201cI would agree, in a sense, that we live in a country and a world where we have a lot of unhealthy ideas of what appropriate sexual relationships are.\u201dMr. Thompson\u2019s decision was a pivotal, if not entirely surprising, turn in a case that dominated news headlines and roiled New York City.The police were initially criticized by some community leaders as waiting too long to alert the public to the report of the rape \u2014 the police released surveillance video of the suspects two days after the alleged attack \u2014 and Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said officials should have alerted residents sooner.Despite the fear stoked by the initial reports, or the relief that followed the arrests, the case was always complicated. Moments after the mayor said the public should have been alerted more quickly, Robert K. Boyce, the Police Department\u2019s chief of detectives, illustrated just how tangled the case was already becoming.Detectives, Chief Boyce acknowledged, were investigating claims that the woman was having sex with her father when the five suspects encountered them.Both eventually admitted to investigators that they had been engaged in sexual relations in the playground, the officials said.A rape test performed on the woman showed the presence of DNA from two of the five suspects, including one who the woman had repeatedly insisted had not had sexual contact with her, the officials said.The two cellphone videos, showing brief verbal exchanges between the woman and the teenagers before the encounter \u2014 together with messages that at least one of the suspects sent out on social media \u2014 depicted what investigators saw as evidence of a consensual encounter.In his social media messages, one teenager expressed worry about what his parents would think, the officials said, and about how to characterize what had occurred.Prosecutors investigated the allegations for nearly seven weeks. They also worked to piece together details of the woman\u2019s life, with some help from her, her father and others.She was taken from her mother, a drug user, at 2 and placed in the care of a local family, who later moved to California. The woman was eventually removed from that family, the officials said. Afterward, she had lived in a series of group homes and other facilities. Investigators learned she had a history of emotional troubles, the officials said.When she turned 18, the woman, whose mother had died, learned her biological father\u2019s identity and contacted him through Facebook, the officials said. Last July, she came to New York to meet him.Besides the statements the woman made to the police and others, she also met three times with prosecutors in their offices in Downtown Brooklyn. When she was interviewed, it was outside the presence of her father, the officials said. Prosecutors treated the case with sensitivity, the officials said. Experienced sex-crimes investigators spoke with her. Counselors and social workers were available to assist her.But in the last of those interviews, on Feb. 18, the woman told prosecutors she was unwilling to go forward with the case. She portrayed all of what had happened in Osborn Playground as a result of her consensual actions \u2014 saying she did not stop the suspects from advancing. At one point, she told investigators she \u201cdoesn\u2019t do\u201d court, the officials said. At another, she said she could not explain why she made conflicting statements in the past.\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to testify,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to bring the case. She expressed a complete unwillingness to cooperate in any criminal prosecution.\u201dAside from her lack of cooperation, considered vital to most sex-crimes inquiries, the prosecutors have no evidence that the woman resisted sexual contact.Although the woman said she had been drunk, along with her father, her blood was not drawn in the hospital that night, so her blood-alcohol content is not known. The woman had no injuries consistent with being raped, only a wound on her knee that officials said she suffered when she fell while running from officers who responded.Prosecutors are unable to charge the woman\u2019s father with incest because of her lack of cooperation, and even if they could, they were concerned about the impact such a prosecution might have on her well-being.The woman is not living with her father at this time, the officials said.\u201cIt is my fervent hope that this young woman gets all the support that she needs going forward,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in his statement. \u201cMy office, including our victim advocates who have been working with this young woman, stand ready to provide her with any assistance she may need.\u201dMichael Wilson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

An eager political showman, Mr. Christie theatrically dressed down critics in town-hall forums and then posted videos of the exchanges online that wowed a fast-growing group of national followers. He seemed to get the best of the New Jersey Democrats and the state\u2019s labor unions in one confrontation after another, muscling through a law to overhaul public pensions and wearing down teachers\u2019 unions in a bid to overhaul the tenure system.In 2011, a contingent of political donors from Iowa visited Mr. Christie in New Jersey and urged him to run for president.Mr. Christie seemed unstoppable. His re-election propelled him into the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association, where he wooed many of the country\u2019s wealthiest conservative donors. In the winter of 2013, he stood atop polls in the national Republican primary race.Additional accusations of payback and vengeance emerged, and Mr. Christie\u2019s approach to politics, which seemed in his first term like a stern but necessary corrective to dysfunction in Trenton, began to look increasingly like bullying.Instead of entering the presidential race as an exemplar of Republican success in a Democratic state, Mr. Christie limped in as an embattled figure who had largely lost the confidence of the wealthiest donors bankrolling presidential campaigns.Still, for a brief period in the fall, a path had seemed to open for Mr. Christie in the 2016 race. He climbed in the polls after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., delivering a forceful national security message anchored in his experience as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey.With his gift for banter, Mr. Christie seemed to revel in the give and take of the town-hall meetings that are a staple of New Hampshire politics.But he never resolved the core vulnerabilities at the heart of his campaign: a record of cutting deals with New Jersey Democrats that conservatives found distasteful, and the perception that a legal cloud hung over his administration in Trenton.When he appeared to be gaining ground, Mr. Christie\u2019s opponents unleashed an avalanche of negative commercials against him, highlighting New Jersey\u2019s poor credit rating and Mr. Christie\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and invoking the bridge scandal.A \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing Mr. Rubio spent millions of dollars to run an advertisement showing Mr. Christie warmly greeting President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. The image has long been an infuriating one for conservatives, who thought that Mr. Christie was too friendly with Mr. Obama in the closing days of his re-election campaign against Mitt Romney.But Mr. Christie\u2019s campaign also became a study in political determination, and in the effect a candidate can have by simply refusing to give up.And after the pro-Rubio super PAC helped sap his momentum, Mr. Christie seemed to embrace stopping a candidate he deemedunprepared for the presidency.Five days before Saturday\u2019s commanding debate appearance, Mr. Christie told New Hampshire voters that he had been tested in political combat in a way that Mr. Rubio, whom he derided as a first-term senator with no consequential achievements, had not.\u201cYou cannot put someone in the Oval Office who doesn\u2019t want the heat,\u201d Mr. Christie said.\u201cI want the heat.

This allows for eye contact and fleeting, semi-apologetic acknowledgments that we are sharing close quarters. More important, it lets us navigate with greater precision to avoid stepping on the toes of fellow theatergoers or knocking hot sauce onto the Givenchys of people at neighboring tables with the backs of our jackets.Every year, a close relative gives me small but generous cash gifts to hold in trust for my children\u2019s education.

You\u2019ve given us so much already, and I will never be able to pay you back.\u201d To which, he will probably reply: \u201cThese are gifts, not loans. And I will have given enough when the children\u2019s college educations are secure.\u201dIf there is some other discomfort (that you didn\u2019t feel like sharing) or simply want these gifts to stop (for whatever reason), just use the first two sentences I suggested. But don\u2019t be hasty. College costs exceed most grasps these days. No shame in that. It may take a village to raise a child, but it takes a small metropolitan area to pay her tuition.My husband and I are friends with another couple. We have two young children; they have three. When they make social plans with us, only the father shows up \u2014 juggling or mildly ignoring his three children. This makes it hard to have an adult conversation, and makes us feel like backup child care for when the mother is working or traveling.

It is a tale of clashing visions for American society and commerce. And it provides an instructive preview of looming battles among government agencies for control over industries like drones, smartphones and gadgets yet to come.The ability of companies to freely amass and analyze the personal details of consumers also provides a counterpoint to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I., in which Apple says it wants to protect consumer information from government snoops.At issue was not the classical notion of \u201cprivacy\u201d as the right to keep out prying eyes.When people freely search and share their personal concerns online, their data footprints can leave clues about their most intimate health worries, family matters and financial difficulties. Regulators warned that companies could use those details to narrowly categorize consumers, potentially leading to inferior or unfair treatment.Separately, officials at the Commerce Department were focusing on privacy as an economic issue. They did not want consumers to lose trust in digital services and stop patronizing them, said Cameron F. Kerry, the department\u2019s general counsel at the time. Commerce officials also wanted to ensure that American technology companies could continue to innovate with data.Over the next three years, administration officials developed the privacy initiative. They titled the effort the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to underscore the idea that, among other things, Americans had the right to expect that companies would not use their personal details for unexpected purposes.The document posited consumer privacy as a basic American right that was not dependent on the kindness of app makers.In addition to calling for consumer privacy legislation, the 2012 report proposed a parallel self-regulatory process: Under the auspices of the Commerce Department, industry and consumer groups were to work together to devise voluntary privacy practices for mobile apps, drones and other technologies.\u201cThe Obama administration released the first-ever comprehensive consumer privacy blueprint to provide a template for stakeholders from across the public and private sectors to implement policies that safeguard American consumers and innovation,\u201d Jennifer Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, said in an email.The lofty aims ran into challenges.The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, began to convene meetings to encourage technology companies, trade groups and consumer advocates to reach consensuses on privacy practices in various industries; the biometric industry would weigh in on facial recognition, for example.\u201cThat is a major success,\u201d said John Verdi, director of privacy initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The app notices, he said, were intended to make \u201cmore transparent to consumers what their privacy policies are, what data they collect, what data they share.\u201dThe multistakeholder talks on facial recognition technology were more contentious. Facial recognition can be used to identify unknown people by taking scans of their faces and comparing them with facial scans from a photo database of named people.\u201cThis is the single best process for moving this forward,\u201d he said.But David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the consensus process had proved to be of little benefit to consumers.\u201cIf you want to protect consumers,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said, \u201cyou don\u2019t simply allow industry to decide what to do in a way in which they don\u2019t have any incentive to compromise.\u201dThe clash continues between consumer advocates who warn that unfettered commercial data collection could chill the daily routines of Americans \u2014 where they go, what they say, how they shop \u2014 and industry advocates who warn that any restrictions on data collection could chill innovation.Administration officials say legislation is still needed.\u201cWe continue to call on Congress to advance legislation in line with the common-sense protections outlined in the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,\u201d said Ms. Friedman, the White House spokeswoman.\u201cAn individual should have control over their information,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, \u201cnot a Facebook, Google or Internet service provider.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clinton Campaign Rebuffs Sanders on Latino Vote in Nevada", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had one of its polling firms that specializes in the Latino vote assess the Nevada caucus results in an effort to rebut the claim by Senator Bernie Sanders that, though he lost over all, he won among Hispanics, a demographic that is crucial to the success of both candidates.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign said it viewed the loss in Nevada as a success because of the inroads he made with Latinos, and his claim to have broadened his coalition while edging into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support with Latinos,  put the imperative on the Clinton campaign to try to show her strength among a demographic that will be critical in Super Tuesday states like Texas and Colorado.The Clinton team report by Latino Decisions, obtained by The New York Times, says that the entrance polls from Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses that showed Mr. Sanders defeating Mrs. Clinton by eight percentage points among Latinos, who made up 20 percent of Democratic caucus goers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not add up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The disagreement is a critical one for both sides: For Mr. Sanders proving his message resonated with Latinos debunks concerns that he only appeals to the white voters who delivered his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and that he can be competitive in the larger, more diverse states that have contests in March. For Mrs. Clinton, holding on to her Latino support is an imperative as she seeks to solidify her delegate lead in places like Texas and prove she can draw a diverse coalition of voters who would be the linchpin of a general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we learned today is that Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firewall with Latino voters is a myth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for the Sanders campaign, said shortly after Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss Saturday to Mrs. Clinton by 5.5 percentage points. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is critically important as we move ahead to states like Colorado, Arizona, Texas and California,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Mrs. Clinton won Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and most of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Latino population, by 11 percentage points. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not possible that Clinton lost the Latino vote yet won Clark County,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whose caucus goers were 30 percent Latino, by 11 points, the Clinton team\u2019s memo said.Latino Decisions says the data shows that Mrs. Clinton was victorious in the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants.In precincts 4560 and 4559, both of which are in Clark County and are over 80 percent Hispanic, the polling firm says that Mrs. Clinton won seven and twelve delegates to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one and four.According to the memo, similar patterns occurred in East Las Vegas, where Mrs. Clinton had a heavy presence and enlisted surrogates like the Latina activist Dolores Huerta, the actress Eva Longoria and Chelsea Clinton, to rally volunteers, attend rallies or knock on doors. Mrs. Clinton also swept the caucuses in the casinos, which drew predominantly Latino workers on a break from their jobs as blackjack dealers, cooks and housekeepers. The caucus at the Caesar\u2019s Palace here was almost entirely conducted in Spanish with workers wearing \u201cEstoy Contigo\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m with you\u201d) T-shirts.The Latino Decisions pollsters, Matt A. Barreto and Gary M. Segura, known as experts at polling Hispanics, a difficult group to count because of their reliance on cellphones and at times transient nature, pointed to flaws in the Nevada entrance polls that the Sanders campaign relied on.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many of the Latino entrance poll questionnaires were completed in Spanish?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Latino electorate in Nevada is 35 percent foreign born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They also questioned the entrance polls reporting that 40 percent of nonwhite caucus goers had college degrees, a figure that proved to be off by nearly double. Ben Tulchin, a pollster for the Sanders campaign, called the Latino Decisions report \u201cdesperate spin\u201d and said that younger Latinos who live all over the state overwhelming caucused for Mr. Sanders. The Sanders voters, Mr. Tulchin said, consisted largely of acculturated second and third generation English speaking Latinos who do not live in the predominantly Spanish speaking enclaves in Clark County that the Clinton campaign had intentionally focused on, he said, in order to make the results appear more favorable.Losing the Latino vote would be a huge blow to Mrs. Clinton who unveiled her immigration reform plans here in May alongside the children of undocumented immigrants and has emphasized outreach to Latino voters. The Super Tuesday contest in Texas on March 1, where Mrs. Clinton hopes to solidify her delegate lead, will likely be made up of a 25 percent Latino and 20 percent African-American electorate.In 2008, Mrs. Clinton won 63 percent of the Latino vote in the 16 Super Tuesday contests, compared to 35 percent for Barack Obama, according to exit polls.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Someone had overheard him talking to his court-appointed lawyer.\u201cThey would say, \u2018What are you in for?\u2019\u201d Mr. Riddle, 28, recalled a few days later.He replied, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the drone guy.\u2019\u201dOn paper, the drone guy seemed harmless enough. According to a criminal complaint, on Feb. 4 at 5:30 p.m., the defendant, Mr. Riddle, \u201coperated said \u2018drone\u2019\u201d in front of a building at 350 Fifth Avenue. Operating the drone created \u201csubstantial risk of physical injury to pedestrians,\u201d the complaint stated, although no one was hurt.Had Mr. Riddle operated his drone a few blocks away, perhaps he would not have spent the night in a holding cell with a new nickname. But 350 Fifth Avenue is not just any building; it is the Empire State Building.At his apartment in Jersey City last week, Mr. Riddle explained.Raised in Indiana, he graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in agricultural biotechnology and moved to New York City in 2012. He discovered his passion was in the nonprofit world.He was hands-on. When he helped plan a Big Blue Christmas event at a bar on West 33rd Street last year, Mr. Riddle wanted blue Santa hats. He bought bolts of blue and white fabric and a Singer sewing machine and turned his apartment into a one-man sweatshop.He had an idea to create an organization that could put people at nonprofits in touch quickly. He decided to make a video to generate interest.The video had a plot: A man is trying to get to an event at a bar in Manhattan. He takes a helicopter over the city. The pilot tells him that to get to the bar on time, he should put on a parachute and jump. Mr. Riddle needed to film the descent from the man\u2019s point of view, with the ground rushing toward the camera.This called for a drone. Mr. Riddle went on Amazon and bought an Ionic 6-Axis Quadcopter Drone with a camera for $69.99. He flew it in his apartment. He said he looked up laws for using drones on Google and, satisfied he was out of the forbidden zone around airports, packed the drone in a duffel bag and took the train to Midtown Manhattan.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best idea,\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201cbut I figured I had it in me.\u201dHe saw some police officers standing near Macy\u2019s and approached them. He told them he wanted to fly the drone straight up and let it descend. He said an officer replied, \u201cSounds O.K. to me.\u201dThus feeling empowered with a municipal seal of approval, Mr. Riddle set the drone on the ground by 350 Fifth Avenue.Mr. Riddle said his drone flew up to about the sixth story before the trouble began: \u201cThe wind takes it, and it bumps against the Empire State Building a few times.\u201dNot good.\u201cI let it drop, and it falls onto the first tier, which is like five floors up,\u201d he said. He entered the lobby, approached a security guard and asked to get his drone back.\u201cYou got some ID?\u201d the guard said.Detectives questioned him at length. They had apparently seen his Facebook page, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s BBN?\u201d in a tone, he said, that suggested they thought it might be linked to ISIS.Mr. Riddle spent several hours in the holding cell before he was arraigned and released, he said. His case is pending. His drone is evidence. He returned to the police station to collect his other property, and the officer at the desk asked his name.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Dude,\u2019\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the drone guy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

There was a guest room on the ground floor, room to entertain on the parlor floor and three bedrooms on the third level. But it was the park views that won Matt Cohler over, his brother said.Floor-to-ceiling French doors in the living room and windows in the upstairs master bedroom frame a view of Alexander Calder\u2019s 26-foot-tall \u201cJaney Waney\u201d in Gramercy Park. Inspired by the bright red sculpture, Mr. Cohler went to work decorating the space for his brother and tweaking some design elements, including a glass wall in the guest bathroom, which he removed. While working for family can be a mixed blessing, he said, that wasn\u2019t the case with his brother: \u201cWe\u2019re very synergistic.\u201dThe makeover took about six months and cost roughly $1.3 million, including furnishings, Mr. Cohler said. The result is a fusion of classic and contemporary, with splashes of color.The spacious foyer has striking white geometric wall paneling that leads up the stairs to the bedrooms and connects the living and dining rooms, at opposite ends of the parlor floor. Faux suede covers the walls of the living room, which has a wet bar, a gas fireplace and French doors that open to Juliet balconies overlooking the park. Glass pocket doors coated with a thin layer of rice-paper film pull out for privacy. The dining room, at the end of a library-like gallery lined with oak shelving, has sliding ladders and a fireplace. Mr. Cohler decorated the space around a family heirloom: a Steinway grand piano from the 1920s. Two more Juliet balconies overlook the landscaped deck with room to entertain. There is also a glass-block terrace.Off the dining room, with its own service entrance, is a kitchen outfitted with custom Varenna cabinetry from Poliform and Corian counters.Upstairs, the expansive park-facing master suite has a walk-in closet, a fireplace, a sitting area and a two spalike baths outfitted with teak millwork and textured tiles. Mr. Cohler lined the bedroom walls with cotton-backed lamb\u2019s-wool padding. The effect is pin-drop silence. Two additional bedrooms each have en-suite baths and access to a private terrace; one is used as a sitting room and painted a striking persimmon with a lacquer finish.Accessible from the parlor and the ground level, the cellar offers ample storage space, a laundry room and a temperature-controlled cedar wine closet that holds more than 600 bottles. There is also an elevator that serves each floor.The ground floor contains the rent-stabilized apartment and another unit with an en-suite bath and butler\u2019s pantry, which is currently being used as a home gym but could be guest or staff quarters, Mr. Graves said. Both units have private entrances in the front garden.Mr. Cohler said his brother Matt is engaged to be married and that the couple plan to find a new home together on the West Coast. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing a new place for them,\u201d he said. In the meantime, he added, \u201cMy favorite thing to do is steal his keys and walk around the park.\u201dAn article last Sunday about a condominium for sale in a mansion overlooking Gramercy Park gave an outdated name for the venture capital firm where the apartment\u2019s owner is a partner.

He has said that the money was a donation from Saudi royalty and that he returned $620 million. The Saudi government has contradicted that account. It is unclear what happened to the remainder of the money. Mr. Najib has said he did nothing wrong.There are also allegations that at least some of the money the prime minister received was diverted from the 1MDB fund through other companies. One alleged transfer was about $13 million through SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB now owned by the Finance Ministry, which Mr. Najib controls. Mr. Najib has not commented on that transaction.Mr. Muhyiddin said in his statement that the former attorney general had shown him evidence of criminal conduct in the transfer of money from SRC International.\u201cThe scandal surrounding Najib has tarnished the image of the party as well as the government and embarrassed the people \u2014 particularly as I had been briefed on the issue of funds from SRC International by the former attorney general, who also provided proof that it was indeed a criminal act,\u201d he said.The former attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, could not be reached for comment. The decision by the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, to suspend Mr. Muhyiddin as deputy president of the party, leaves Mr. Najib fully in control of the party.Mr. Najib is the president of UMNO, which has long dominated Malaysian politics, and Mr. Muhyiddin\u2019s removal means he has no strong rival in a key party position. The party\u2019s Supreme Council decided on Friday to suspend Mr. Muhyiddin effective immediately on the grounds that he had not performed his duty to help Mr. Najib bolster the party. Last year, Mr. Najib ousted Mr. Muhyiddin as deputy prime minister for questioning the bank deposits. The prime minister also removed Mr. Abdul Gani before he could complete an investigation into the transactions.Mohamed Apandi Ali, who took over as attorney general, announced in January that he had found no evidence of a crime and closed the investigation.Mr. Muhyiddin noted that he was the one being punished even though it was Mr. Najib who received the vast sums of money and who was \u201cat risk of criminal prosecution.\u201dMr. Najib\u2019s office countered with a harsh statement accusing Mr. Muhyiddin and Mr. Abdul Gani of acting inappropriately in discussing the purported evidence.\u201cThis is an admission that there was a high-level conspiracy to topple the Prime Minister, in what would have been a coup against democratic process,\u201d said Azalina Othman Said, a minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department.She said that the sharing of evidence was \u201cnot only unethical but also a breach of the Official Secrets Act.\u201dMr. Najib, in addition to removing officials who were critical of him, has sought to control the growing scandal by putting a lid on investigations into his actions and clamping down on media outlets that looked into the case.Last week, the government blocked the news website Malaysian Insider after it published a report saying there was sufficient evidence for the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to bring charges against Mr. Najib. The report was based on the comments of an unnamed official and was denied by other government officials.Advertisement"}

But while some well-designed trials have found that those randomly assigned to drink artificially sweetened beverages gained less weight than those given sugar-sweetened drinks, large population studies suggest that frequent consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked with unanticipated consequences, including weight gain.A large study that followed a diverse group of 6,814 Americans ages 45 to 84 for at least five years found that those who drank diet soda at least once a day were at 67 percent greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consume diet drinks, regardless of whether they gained weight or not, and at 36 percent greater risk of metabolic syndrome, which can be a precursor to heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Another large study that followed thousands of residents of San Antonio for 10 years found those who drank more than 21 servings of diet drinks a week were at twice the risk of becoming overweight or obese, and the more diet soda people drank, the greater the risk.These large observational trials do not prove cause and effect, however, and may reflect the fact that people who are gaining weight may be most likely to drink a lot of diet soda.Dr. John Fernstrom, a University of Pittsburgh professor who is also a paid consultant to Ajinomoto, a maker of aspartame, reviewed the evidence on nonnutritive sweeteners and concluded that the evidence linking them to metabolic problems was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot compelling.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut other scientists urge caution, saying more research is needed.

The bill, which is likely to hit the Senate floor after next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recess, is expected to have bipartisan support. What it doesn\u2019t have is federal money behind it.

It was not clear whether the website in question was his Facebook page.Mr. Gawish\u2019s lawyer, Mahmoud Othman, said his client was being held overnight at a police station, and was expected to face formal charges on Monday.\u201cThe regime is worried about any creative work,\u201d Mr. Othman said. \u201cThey have shut down art venues, and now they are arresting innovators. The state must be very fragile if it is afraid of cartoonists.\u201dMr. Othman also said, \u201cThe only creative work which is permitted is that which favors the state.\u201dThe government\u2019s intolerance of free expression on the Internet has extended beyond antigovernment criticism.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to those arrested on charges of administering Facebook pages that were sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Syrian Shame", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Putin policy in Syria is clear enough as the encirclement of rebel-held Aleppo proceeds and tens of thousands more Syrians flee toward the Turkish border. It is to entrench the brutal government of Bashar al-Assad by controlling the useful part of Syrian territory, bomb the moderate opposition into submission, block any possibility of Western-instigated regime change, use diplomatic blah-blah in Geneva as cover for changing the facts on the ground and, maybe fifth or sixth down the list, strengthen the Syrian Army to the point it may one day confront the murderous jihadist stronghold of the Islamic State.The troubling thing is that the Putin policy on Syria has become hard to distinguish from the Obama policy.Sure, the Obama administration still pays lip service to the notion that Assad is part of the problem and not the solution, and that if the Syrian leader survives through some political transition period he cannot remain beyond that. But these are words. It is President Vladimir Putin and Russia who are \u201cmaking the weather\u201d in Syria absent any corresponding commitment or articulable policy from President Obama.Aleppo may prove to be the Sarajevo of Syria. It is already the Munich.By which I mean that the city\u2019s plight today \u2014 its exposure to Putin\u2019s whims and a revived Assad\u2019s pitiless designs \u2014 is a result of the fecklessness and purposelessness over almost five years of the Obama administration. The president and his aides have hidden at various times behind the notions that Syria is marginal to core American national interests; that they have thought through the downsides of intervention better than others; that the diverse actors on the ground are incomprehensible or untrustworthy; that there is no domestic or congressional support for taking action to stop the war or shape its outcome; that there is no legal basis for establishing \u201csafe areas\u201d or taking out Assad\u2019s air power; that Afghanistan and Iraq are lessons in the futility of projecting American power in the 21st century; that Syria will prove Russia\u2019s Afghanistan as it faces the ire of the Sunni world; and that the only imperative, whatever the scale of the suffering or the complete evisceration of American credibility, must be avoidance of another war in the Middle East.Where such feeble evasions masquerading as strategy lead is to United States policy becoming Putin\u2019s policy in Syria, to awkward acquiescence to Moscow\u2019s end game and to embarrassed shrugs encapsulating the wish that \u2014 perhaps, somehow, with a little luck \u2014 Putin may crush ISIS.Obama\u2019s Syrian agonizing, his constant what-ifs and recurrent \u201cwhat then?\u201d have also led to the slaughter in Paris and San Bernardino. They have contributed to a potential unraveling of the core of the European Union as internal borders eliminated on a free continent are re-established as a response to an unrelenting refugee tide \u2014 to which the United States has responded by taking in around 2,500 Syrians since 2012, or about 0.06 percent of the total.\u201cThe Syrian crisis is now a European crisis,\u201d a senior European diplomat told me. \u201cBut the president is not interested in Europe.\u201d That is a fair assessment of the first postwar American leader for whom the core trans-Atlantic alliance was something to be dutifully upheld rather than emotionally embraced.Syria is now the Obama administration\u2019s shame, a debacle of such dimensions that it may overshadow the president\u2019s domestic achievements.Putin policy is American policy because the United States has offered no serious alternative. As T.S. Eliot wrote after Munich in 1938, \u201cWe could not match conviction with conviction, we had no ideas with which we could either meet or oppose the ideas opposed to us.\u201d Syria has been the bloody graveyard of American conviction.Putin already has.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Release Video of Traffic Stop of Princeton Professor", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byThe police in Princeton, N.J., released a dashboard video of the traffic stop of a black Princeton professor that led to her being handcuffed and searched by a white male officer \u2014 an encounter that she said left her humiliated and was emblematic of officers\u2019 mistreatment of African-Americans.The video shows what appears to be a routine traffic stop with the professor, Imani Perry, who sounds shaken but appears compliant after two white officers, one male and one female, pulled her over last week after, they said, she had been speeding. She was then arrested and handcuffed over unpaid parking tickets.In the posts, Dr. Perry said the male officer had performed a \u201cbody search\u201d even though a female officer was present, she was not allowed to contact colleagues to inform them of her arrest before being placed in the squad car, and she was later handcuffed to a table at the police station.The Police Department chief, Capt. Nicholas K. Sutter, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that officers had followed policy in arresting the professor.But although the department released footage of the arrest, it has declined to release video of the episode from inside the police station. Responding to a public records request from The New York Times for that footage and other information, Captain Sutter said the department was \u201cresearching the legal requirements\u201d but had \u201cclearly demonstrated compassion to Dr. Perry\u2019s concerns, transparency and responsiveness to media and other public information requests.\u201dCaptain Sutter, who said on Tuesday that he had watched dashboard camera footage of Dr. Perry\u2019s arrest, said it did not show anything unusual. He said the male officer had checked the \u201cexterior portion of her clothing,\u201d meaning Dr. Perry\u2019s jacket pockets and the areas around her shoes.He added that \u201cwe will look at the policy,\u201d which does not require female officers to search female suspects. \u201cWhen we can, we should,\u201d he said.While the 27-minute video released Thursday shows most of Dr. Perry\u2019s traffic stop, key moments of the encounter happen out of view of the camera, and the audio is party drowned out by the sound of passing vehicles.After pulling Dr. Perry over, the male officer told her he had clocked her driving at 67 miles per hour in a 45-m.p.h. zone, according to the footage. He asked if she was in a rush, and she said she was trying to get to work. He asked where she worked, and she told him Princeton University.\u201cJust give me a couple minutes; let me just look over everything, just make sure everything else is valid by checking your registration and everything, and we\u2019ll get you out of here,\u201d the officer told her, going back to his squad car.Fifteen minutes elapsed before the officer returned to her car to tell Dr. Perry that her license had been suspended, which, she said, she did not know. He said he would ask dispatch why it had been suspended.About two minutes later, the officer returned to tell her she had a warrant out for her arrest over a parking offense from 2013.\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d she responded.Dr. Perry showed no verbal or physical resistance as she exited her car with a bag.\u201cUnfortunately, anytime we transport anyone, because you\u2019re under arrest because of the warrant, we have to put you in handcuffs, O.K., that\u2019s anyone,\u201d the male officer said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a parking offense, so nobody else has to know about it,\u201d he added.Dr. Perry asked if she was allowed to text anyone at the university to let them know about the arrest before going to the police station.He said, \u201cWhen we get there, you can call them, you can make as many phone calls and texts as you want.\u201dDr. Perry and the two officers, whose names were not immediately available, then walked out of view of the camera. During what sounded like the search, the male officer asked if she had anything in her pockets like keys or a cellphone.\u201cWe just gotta be sure that you\u2019ve got nothing sharp, not saying you do,\u201d the officer said.At one point, the male officer appeared to show concern, while the female officer mostly observed.\u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Perry responded.\u201cNo? Are you hyperventilating?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs long as you have the money ... we\u2019re just going to process you real quick.\u201dDr. Perry said Thursday that she was mostly relieved to learn that the Police Department had been careful with her personal information \u2014 blurring her face and her license plate in the video \u2014 because of the \u201chundreds upon hundreds of threats and slurs online, by email and via telephone\u201d that she had received since telling her story online.\u201cI find myself saddened because I believe I offered a measured account of my experiences, not to the media but simply on my own social media accounts, and the snowball effect of that is that I have been attacked with incredible ugliness,\u201d she said.\u201cHowever, I believe the outpouring of care and support were a sign that what I shared struck a nerve with many people. And that resonance is something that we as a nation must contend with.\u201dChristine Hauser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Increasingly Muffled Press", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Chinese media have never had much freedom to pursue muckraking stories, or even to dutifully report the facts. Now, President Xi Jinping is going to extraordinary lengths to rein the press in even further.Mr. Xi recently visited the three main newsrooms in the country to convey in unmistakable terms that journalists are expected to behave like apparatchiks. That message, which predictably received fawning coverage, came a few days after the government announced it would further restrict foreign media, too.Under rules Beijing says it will start enforcing next month, foreign companies will be barred from publishing online content \u2014 including text, videos, maps and games \u2014 in China without prior approval from the government. The regulations, which could affect major American companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, are intended to \u201cpromote core socialist values.\u201dThose stifling steps will add to the information barriers Chinese people already face. Major sites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, which hundreds of millions of people around the globe use, are already blocked in China. The Chinese government began blocking access to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times in 2012, in retaliation for an article that exposed the hidden wealth of relatives of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister.Mr. Xi may feel pressure to restrict the worldview of his citizens at a time when the Chinese economy is under strain. An article on Monday in the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, China Daily, said news organizations were \u201cessential to political stability.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary for the media to restore people\u2019s trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged,\u201d the article said.It is during trying times, of course, that societies benefit most from a press that is free to scrutinize questionable policies and expose ineffective leaders.Mr. Xi\u2019s new guidance is likely to make the official press even more docile than it traditionally has been. But the approach will be self-defeating for the government in the long run. In an increasingly interconnected world, it is harder to control the flow of information across borders and within countries. New mechanisms of Internet censorship are typically met with creative tools to bypass them. And each new effort to keep Chinese people ignorant about their government and the outside world will make them only more determined to learn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Raises Her Voice, and a Debate Over Speech and Sexism Rages", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported by_____\u201cI think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with style and delivery, oddly enough,\u201d said Bob Woodward, the veteran Washington Post editor, on MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cShe shouts,\u201d he said, adding that there was \u201csomething unrelaxed about the way she is communicating.\u201dMrs. Clinton, who admits she does not have the natural oratory skills of her husband or President Obama, has been tailoring her voice and tone for years. But only in recent days has her speaking style been thrust back into a heated debate about women, sexism and public speaking.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies berated Mr. Woodward for what they viewed as a gender-based critique of her impassioned tone on the campaign trail, pointing out that the stock in trade of her Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were his rousing remarks delivered in forceful tones.\u201cIt is 2016 and I cannot believe \u2014 cannot believe \u2014 we are having this conversation,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of the group Emily\u2019s List, which works to elect female candidates, in an interview. If Mrs. Clinton is shouting, \u201cwhat is Bernie Sanders doing?\u201d she asked.Even Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor whose 2004 campaign became immortalized by a widely mocked scream, said the criticism of Mrs. Clinton was sexist. \u201cIf she were a male and she were making these kinds of speeches, would people be criticizing her?\u201d Mr. Dean said on Fox News.Mrs. Clinton can be partly credited for igniting the debate.Asked Thursday about Mr. Woodward\u2019s comments to MSNBC, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, directed a reporter to the outraged response on social media from many women.In general, Mr. Fallon said, \u201cthat type of criticism gets leveled at women more than it does at men.\u201dPrivately, even Mrs. Clinton\u2019s friends and supporters say that lately she does seem to be raising her voice more than usual. The tonal shift came in the waning days of the Iowa caucuses, when Mrs. Clinton displayed a fire-in-the-belly determination on the campaign trail that helped her eke a victory against Mr. Sanders.It is partly a reflection of the changing nature of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s events. She devoted the early months of her candidacy to speaking to a handful of voters in round-table discussions, and then shifted to larger town-hall-style events where she took questions and nodded intently as voters asked her about issues like Social Security and climate change.As the voting in Iowa neared, Mrs. Clinton held larger rallies, drawing hundreds of supporters who chanted and waved her \u201cFighting for Us\u201d campaign signs. And because Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady, believes in the importance of 12-point plans, rather than sweeping campaign promises, she often raises her voice when mentioning arcane policy points, which can seem jarring to people unfamiliar with her delivery.\u201cIt\u2019s called an inversion, but I call it a perversion!\u201d is one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favorite lines, referring to the complicated loophole that allows corporations to avoid paying taxes.\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to invest in infrastructure!\u201d she often says, lifting her vocal reach as she promises to rebuild roads and bridges and construct high-speed railways.She grows forceful when emphasizing that the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation includes a provision to break up the big banks, something Mr. Sanders has called for through reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. \u201cFolks, we already have the authority in Dodd-Frank,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says, bringing her voice back down to a near whisper.In settings such as a forum on CNN on Wednesday and in the Democratic debates, Mrs. Clinton seems comfortable, able to string together paragraphs of complex policy talk off the cuff. But that does not always come through when she speaks to large groups, public speaking experts said.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wisdom to the old adage that you almost garner more attention when you whisper,\u201d said Terri Sjodin, a public speaking consultant based in Newport Beach, Calif. \u201cBut there\u2019s an adrenaline that gets high when you\u2019re in a large venue, an auditorium, and a natural tendency to shout or get louder.\u201dIn some ways, the debate over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking style is a reflection of the larger phenomenon of her candidacy \u2014 and that she is the first woman to have a serious shot at becoming a major political party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u201cSome research suggests women can be competent or likable, but not both,\u201d said Denise Graveline, a former aide in the Clinton administration and the author of \u201cThe Eloquent Woman\u2019s Guide to Moderating Panels.\u201d She pointed to the 1984 election, when Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice-presidential candidate, struggled to find the right tenor.Ms. Ferraro \u201clacked the credibility of a male candidate, adopted a stronger, more masculine style that may have suited her less,\u201d Ms. Graveline said.The tendency to yell on the campaign stump is not gender specific, but the public is much less accustomed to hearing a woman\u2019s voice in such settings, said Ruth Sherman, a public speaking coach who advises chief executives and celebrities.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a whole generation of new voters who have never heard her in this way before,\u201d Ms. Sherman said of Mrs. Clinton.But, she added, the former secretary of state, like many public figures male and female, could afford to work on her delivery.\u201cShe tends to substitute volume for expression,\u201d Ms. Sherman said.Advertisement"}

He couldn\u2019t wait to get out of his home borough, he said in an interview he gave for a 2012 \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d documentary, \u201cInventing David Geffen,\u201d and he said he left home the day he graduated from high school.Mr. Geffen is using his wealth to put his stamp on his home city, much as he did with the music business. He has come a long way from Borough Park, a mostly Italian and Jewish enclave where he lived with his family in a six-story brick apartment building on 15th Avenue.\u201cFree Man in Paris,\u201d written and recorded by Joni Mitchell for her 1974 album \u201cCourt and Spark\u201d (on the Asylum label), was a character sketch of Mr. Geffen in those years, and it captured him in all his contradictions.\u201cDavid got bored with Los Angeles a long time ago,\u201d said Tina Brown, the magazine editor and a founder of The Daily Beast, who has known him 25 years.The renaming resulted from Mr. Geffen\u2019s gift of $100 million, which will cover 20 percent of the estimated cost to renovate the symphony hall, which was built in 1962.As a philanthropist, Mr. Geffen has shown the same dealmaking skill that served him well as he moved from the mailroom at the William Morris Agency to become a tycoon. In the Lincoln Center deal, he demanded that his name remain on the building in perpetuity. (Avery Fisher\u2019s name lasted 42 years, from the time of his $10.5 million donation in 1973 until the recent change. His heirs received $15 million from Lincoln Center to go away.)\u201cLike men of a certain age, he is looking at his legacy and how he will be remembered,\u201d said Diane von Furstenberg, a longtime friend. \u201cThere is a maturity when you realize you are no longer immortal.\u201dHe bought a house on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, N.Y., two years ago, which is getting an architectural makeover. And he is in the last throes of renovating his grand apartment, for which he paid $54 million in 2012, with its view, across Central Park, of (what else?) Lincoln Center.\u201cDavid doesn\u2019t go out a ton,\u201d said Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who is a friend. \u201cMy guess is that he\u2019s just not interested in making new friends. He has a broad circle of friends, and he sticks to that.\u201dMs. Murdoch recalled a conversation with Mr. Geffen about his scrappy upbringing in Brooklyn, where his mother, a seamstress who had emigrated from Ukraine, ran a corset shop and his father, an intellectual with not much taste for work, read a lot but made little money. \u201cHe said his clothes never fit him because they bought a size bigger,\u201d Ms. Murdoch said.Mr. Geffen\u2019s older brother, Mitchell, a lawyer who attended U.C.L.A., died in 2006. The younger Mr. Geffen wrote in his high school yearbook that he wanted to be a lawyer, like his brother, but he ended up dropping out of college.As an agent, manager and record executive in the early 1970s, he nurtured the careers of Laura Nyro, the Eagles, Jackson Browne and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. In the \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d documentary, David Crosby said they hired Mr. Geffen because they wanted a \u201cshark.\u201d\u201cI asked David, \u2018Why did you do that? You are ruining the view,\u2019\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cHe said he wanted the privacy.\u201dHe acquired the yacht from the Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison. It is built to accommodate 18 guests and a staff of about 50. Because of its size, it is tracked online by maritime websites (it was recently docked at Carriacou, one of the Grenadine Islands).Peggy Siegal, the doyenne of New York publicists, had lunch aboard the vessel with Mr. Geffen in St. Barth\u2019s over the New Year\u2019s holiday. \u201cHe likes to greet each guest himself,\u201d she said. She was asked to climb several flights of stairs to the top deck, despite the elevator onboard. \u201cHe is waiting for you,\u201d she said, \u201carms outstretched, while you are gasping for air.\u201dMs. Brown said, \u201cDavid enjoys being able to invite the world on his own terms.\u201dAmong his favorite guests was Nora Ephron, the writer and film director who died in 2012. \u201cShe and David were very close,\u201d said the writer Nicholas Pileggi, who was married to Ms. Ephron for 25 years. \u201cThey would talk once or twice a day. They were on the same gossip level and knew everything between the two of them.\u201dMs. Ephron was part camp counselor, part onboard hostess. She planned menus and organized charades after dessert. She set up day trips to port towns and insisted that Mr. Geffen go. \u201cShe would order him off the boat and, on some occasions, he would fight,\u201d Mr. Pileggi said. \u201cAt that moment, he would be in the middle of a book and the last thing he wanted to do was go to town.\u201d\u201cI do think David likes solitude,\u201d said Eric Eisner, who has worked with him. \u201cWhile people are a great source of information for him, they are also a great source of distraction.\u201dOn Dec. 31, Mr. Geffen attended a dinner party in St. Barth\u2019s given by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and his wife, Dasha Zhukova, on their yacht, Ms. Siegal said. Prince was flown in to play for the large crowd. But by the time the singer finally appeared, Ms. Siegal said, Mr. Geffen had gone back to his own yacht.Some of them may not have known that the guest of honor was born and raised a subway ride away. \u201cHe may see himself as a New Yorker, but we all think of David Geffen as from Los Angeles,\u201d said Barbara Walters, who brokered the introduction between Lincoln Center and Mr. Geffen and was seated next to him at the ceremony. \u201cNow, this establishes him in New York.\u201dReynold Levy, the president of the Robin Hood Foundation, who knows Mr. Geffen, said making a donation in exchange for naming rights is nothing new. \u201cIt is essentially a form of biography and expression of self,\u201d he said. And Mr. Geffen\u2019s return home is something he understands. \u201cPeople born in New York can\u2019t shake it,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cWhen they are finished with whatever else they are doing, they want to return.\u201dAn article last Sunday about David Geffen correctly quoted Diane von Furstenberg as saying, \u201cThere is a maturity when you realize you are no longer mortal.\u201d After the article was published, Ms. von Furstenberg confirmed she meant to say \u201cno longer immortal.\u201d Her quotation was revised to reflect her initial intention.Advertisement"}

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive comments about Mexican immigrants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was the first person to call out Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.She promised to remove a rule that requires immigrants who have returned to their home countries to wait three or 10 years, depending on how long they had been in the country illegally, before applying to return to the United States. And she criticized her opponent, saying he has not clearly promised to do away with the policy.Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign promptly responded on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad to hear Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to remove the three and ten year bars against returning immigrants put in place by the Clinton admin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the campaign wrote. (To which the Clinton team said to Mr. Sanders in a Twitter response: \u201cYou voted for it.\u201d)Mrs. Clinton was asked about a comment she made in a debate during the 2008 Democratic primary race in which she said she did not support a policy in New York that would give driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s licenses to undocumented immigrants. She responded that it had been a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate issue\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that she supports a federal law to provide driver\u2019s licenses.Both candidates, in the final sprint before the caucuses, also held public events on Thursday night after the forum. Mr. Sanders spoke at a Democratic dinner for Clark County, where he again affirmed his commitment to immigration reform and took his own shots at Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no justification, no reason for people to resort to bigotry, xenophobia and racial hatred when we are talking about Mexicans or when we are talking Muslims,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders announced at the dinner that the Clark County Black Caucus was endorsing him.

{"Headline": "A Do-It-Yourself Revolution in Diabetes Care", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byJohn Costik got the call at the office in 2012. It was his wife, Laura, with terrible news: Their 4-year-old son, Evan, was headed into the emergency room.His blood sugar reading was sky high, about 535 mg/dl, and doctors had discovered he had Type 1 diabetes. The first three days in the hospital were a blur during which the Costiks, engineers in Rochester, received a crash course in managing the basics of diabetes care.For starters, they were told to log their son\u2019s numbers on paper forms. It was their first hint that diabetes management did not occupy a place on technology\u2019s bleeding edge. The methods for guesstimating carbohydrate intake also seemed imprecise, Mr. Costik found, and the process generated a lot of wasted data.\u201cThe last thing you want to do is find some form and fill it out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just emotionally trying to cope with it, and that data in that book isn\u2019t necessarily useful to the people with diabetes.\u201dSeveral months later, Mr. Costik fitted his son with a Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor. A hair-thin sensor under Evan\u2019s skin recorded an exact blood sugar reading at five-minute intervals, 24 hours a day.But all that data left with Evan every morning when he headed off to day care. Mr. Costik wanted something better: continuous access to his son\u2019s glucose readings.So he examined the device\u2019s software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser, Android mobile phone or, eventually, his Pebble smartwatch.\u201cI wanted our lives to be simple,\u201d Mr. Costik said, \u201cand I wanted Evan to live a long time, and diabetes to be a nuisance, not a huge struggle.\u201dMr. Costik shared a photograph of his simple hack on Twitter \u2014 and discovered a legion of parents who were eager to tailor off-the-shelf devices into homemade solutions. Together, they have set in motion a remarkable, egalitarian push for improved technology to manage diabetes care, rarely seen in the top-down world of medical devices.In 2014, the last year for which data is available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 29 million adults were living with diabetes. Of these, 5 to 10 percent had Type 1, which develops when the body\u2019s immune system destroys pancreatic beta cells.Now, as consumer gadgets weave themselves ever more tightly into everyday life, patients and their families are finding homespun solutions to problems medical-device manufacturers originally did not address. Industry executives say the pace of user-driven innovation was one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently reclassified remote glucose-monitoring devices, hastening approval for new models by big companies like Dexcom and Medtronics.James Wedding, a civil engineer who lives outside Dallas, saw Mr. Costik\u2019s Twitter post and used his code to set up a remote monitor system for his daughter, Carson, who is now 12.\u201cOnce I got all the pieces together, I remember crying \u2014 not quite in sadness, just in utter amazement \u2014 the first time I could see her numbers displayed on my computer screen and she was on the other side of the house,\u201d Mr. Wedding said.We asked parents of children with Type 1 diabetes to share their stories about the educational obstacles they have encountered and the steps they took to overcome them.\u201cIt is such a change in your relationship when the first question out of your mouth when you talk to your son, your daughter, your spouse, your brother, whatever, is no longer, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s your number?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How was math class? How was work? What are you up to today?\u2019\u201dLane Desborough, an engineer in California, got in touch with Mr. Costik after seeing his tweet, ultimately creating an open-source system based in part on Mr. Costik\u2019s code. It allows anyone to hack existing glucose monitors so they transmit readings to the cloud, where they can be read by patients and caregivers.More recently, the home tinkering projects have buoyed a patient-led initiative to make generic insulin. Anthony Di Franco, a founder of the biotech hacker space Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, Calif., has had diabetes for 10 years. Mr. Di Franco saw what parents with diabetic children were doing with glucose monitoring devices and wondered why, even with insurance coverage, a three-month supply of insulin often totaled hundreds of dollars.\u201cI was frustrated with the situation,\u201d he said.With available laboratory tools, and a wealth of available academic literature, he set out to learn whether insulin could be home-brewed on a small scale. After some research, Mr. Di Franco realized, \u201cWe can do it, and we can do it now. All of the tools already exist.\u201dThe intent is not to make insulin at home, or on an industrial scale. Any drug that is injected comes with substantial risks and would face considerable regulatory scrutiny. Rather, the hackers hope to be able to demonstrate the technological feasibility. Within a year or two, Mr. Di Franco said he envisions handing off the protocols and any intellectual property to a generics manufacturer.\u201cOne thing that would make me happy,\u201d he said, \u201cis that if more people who needed insulin got ahold of it by whatever means necessary.\u201dDr. Greene argues that while manufacturers in insulin are making innovations \u2014 the newest forms of insulin are substantial improvements over earlier products \u2014 they stop producing the older forms once they lose patent protection. Patients and their insurers pay a high price for patented insulin or go without.Biohackers are attempting to resurrect an older product to address the lack of generic insulin, Dr. Greene said.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should be surprised that a population of technologically savvy patients, whose lives are dependent on access to a supply of a biological agent, should be interested in taking means of production into their own hands, especially at time when insulin prices have risen at unpredictably alarming rates.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was difficult. It was a lesson in humility.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Pav\u00c3\u00b3n eventually took up photography to document his paintings and other work. That was four years ago and, and like many before him, he was hooked. His interest turned into an obsession to document the world he inhabited. Rather than looking for the recreation of Cuba that exists in parts of South Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older exile communities, he found a population that was spread out and blending in.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Cubans up here, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harder to put them into a box,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUp here, they have to mix more with all the other ethnic groups. Miami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cuban community has almost become an extension of Cuba. Here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like that. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t defy nature, the snow and cold. People live more closed in. A lot of the scenes are interiors. Less open space and more intimate.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere are some famous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even infamous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 faces in his exhibit. One shows the jazz musician Paquito D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rivera seated at his home, playing for an elderly vocalist who has just finished singing. Another shows Luis Posada Carriles, a former C.I.A. operative who was responsible for numerous hotel bombings in Havana during the 1990s, mugging for the camera, looking like Freddy Krueger.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome Cuban-Americans see him as a patriot, others see him as a terrorist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Pav\u00c3\u00b3n said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the photo, he is acting the role he has been given, the boogeyman.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Pav\u00c3\u00b3n says there is still a lot to be discovered among the communities he knows in New Jersey. But his other work reflects his desire to examine lives in limbo. One project of his looks at former political prisoners. More recently, he has been in Costa Rica, where thousands of Cuban migrants have been stuck, unable to cross into Nicaragua \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and onward to Mexico and the United States to seek asylum \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after Nicaraguan authorities closed the border.Given his obsession with documenting, Mr. Pav\u00c3\u00b3n is doing less painting and more photographing. In some ways, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a more welcome routine.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is this unreal world of fine art, where artists have to invent complicated theories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are fads, fashions and tastes that are imposed on you. So artists change to satisfy an arbitrary market. Photography lets me work with life itself. With things I see and select, not some preconceived notion defined by fashions or the market. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way of making a living that gets me involved with life. You have to live among what you are photographing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

The military was preparing to sweep them out.As the sun was setting, I spotted Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawatdiphol, a renegade who had defected to the protesters, and asked him what he would do next.His \u201cpeople\u2019s army\u201d would not back down, he said. \u201cThe military cannot get in here.\u201dOne blink earlier he was answering my questions. Now he was slumped on the ground, his vacant eyes still open, as blood spilled onto his camouflage uniform. The world around me went into slow motion as I watched the general being dragged away by his supporters. The bullet that felled General Khattiya in 2010 missed my head by inches.It is hard to speak collectively about a region of so many different languages, ethnicities, religions and political traditions. But as I start a new assignment in a part of the world that may as well be a different cosmos \u2014 Northern California \u2014 I have been trying to make sense of what I have seen in Southeast Asia.I come back to one theme again and again: impunity.In the killing of General Khattiya, who never regained consciousness and died several days later, a report by an independent body concluded that the assassin had probably fired from a building controlled by the military.\u201cUnfortunately, some people died,\u201d said the prime minister at the time, Abhisit Vejjajiva. A murder case against him was dismissed.It is often no secret who is committing abuses in Southeast Asia, whether they are illegally cutting down forests, trafficking drugs, skimming a percentage from government transactions or shooting protesters.Unusual wealth, the euphemism for suspected graft, is everywhere.He has never explained how he amassed this tidy sum on his annual army salary of $40,000. \u201cDo not judge people based on your perceptions,\u201d he said in a television address after he and other top-ranking army officers and police officers revealed their fortunes.Watching the rise of Asia during my time here, I have wondered whether there can be continued prosperity without justice. Can societies so thoroughly riddled with corruption carry through with the remarkable economic advances made over recent decades?To see wrongdoing here, sometimes all you have to do is knock. Across the Mekong River, in Laos, at the edge of a forest, I found the walled compound of Vixay Keosavang, a Laotian businessman who has been described as the Pablo Escobar of wildlife trafficking.After I banged on the compound\u2019s heavy metal gate, a security guard rolled it open. Yes, the guard said, there were live tigers, bears and many other endangered species inside. Neighbors said trucks regularly left Mr. Vixay\u2019s compound loaded with lizards and pangolins, an anteater-like animal that is rapidly disappearing because it is eaten for supposed medicinal qualities.Mr. Vixay had been so nonchalant in his trafficking business that he used commercial courier services to send rhino horns and ivory tusks directly to his company\u2019s office in Laos.No one has come forward to claim it. Mr. Vixay has never been charged. The Laotian authorities say they have no evidence against him.After telling me about the animals inside, the guard called Mr. Vixay on a cellphone and handed it to my interpreter.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Mr. Vixay said. \u201cWho told you about it?\u201dThe authorities in Southeast Asia have access to many of the same tools as their counterparts in wealthier countries. What seems to be lacking is not technology but political will to investigate powerfully connected people. Tony Pua, an opposition leader in Malaysia, calls it a culture of \u201cforget it and move on.\u201dThe phone company balked, so I contacted a friendly naval officer, Lt. Cmdr. Veerapong Nakprasit, who persuaded the company to give me the phone\u2019s location on humanitarian grounds. The navy, aware that the refugees could die without help, presumably could have made the request and found the boat on its own.That evening, out of sight of journalists, the Thai Navy pushed the boat back out into the open sea.The refugee crisis in Southeast Asia last year spiraled into a regional embarrassment that forced governments to admit that their own officials were complicit in trafficking desperate migrants from Myanmar. Yet in Thailand, amid a supposed crackdown on trafficking by the military junta, the head of the investigation fled to Australia and applied for political asylum, saying he had been threatened by powerful people. The Thai junta has not set a firm timetable for leaving power, but its members are taking no chances.Soon after the May 2014 coup, they issued a decree that put them above the law for \u201call acts,\u201d including the seizure of power and any \u201cpunishments\u201d they meted out.The last words of the Constitution they wrote for themselves call for blanket immunity. The junta members are \u201centirely discharged\u201d for their acts.Lawyers representing the victims of the crackdown in 2010 say they see little hope for justice now that the military is in power.One of the key witnesses in the crackdown, Nattatida Meewangpla, is a paramedic who says she saw six people shot by soldiers.For the past year, she has been held in detention on the orders of a military court, charged with participating in a social media chat group that opposed the military takeover. Her lawyers say the military is trying to silence her.\u201cPeople were chased and killed,\u201d she wrote to me from prison last month. \u201cI am the only witness still breathing.\u201dMy decade here has been a time of intense ambivalence. I was enchanted by people\u2019s warmth, congeniality and politeness. When I interviewed protesters on torrid summer days, they would often fan my face as we spoke. I learned from my Thai friends how to laugh away life\u2019s disappointments and annoyances. I relished the food and marveled at the hospitality.But I despaired at the venality of the elites and the corruption that engulfed the lives of so many people I interviewed. I came to see Southeast Asia as a land of great people and bad governments, of remarkable graciousness but distressing levels of impunity.Thomas Fuller was the Southeast Asia correspondent for The International Herald Tribune and The New York Times from 2006 until this month.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Huddled Masses", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 From London to Athens, Europe is questioned. Some people, mainly refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, are dying to get into the European Union. Many British conservatives are fighting to get out of it. Others, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, plot to undermine it. Yet others are bored by it: The 20th century and the strategic imperatives behind NATO and the European Union seem far away to wired millennials.The two most powerful symbols of European integration \u2014 the euro that binds 19 European Union states in a common currency and the Schengen accords that allow people to move freely among 22 European Union nations \u2014 are in danger of unraveling under the pressure of polarized politics, diverging economic performance and the influx of more than one million desperate migrants and refugees in the past year.It can be averted. The Europe of today is not the Europe of the 1930s. In Berlin, Angela Merkel stands tall, a European leader of immense stature. Still, the fissuring pressures are intense.Sometimes, as Yeats noted, \u201cthe falcon cannot hear the falconer.\u201d We live in an age of unraveling. The postwar is over. The post-Cold War is over. The United States, under President Obama, has quietly stepped back from Europe. Washington is nowhere to be seen on the refugee crisis, the absent power, much as it was absent from the Minsk process on the Ukraine crisis.Now refugees stream from Syria and elsewhere into Europe. If they carry a banner, it should read, \u201cReap what you sow, feckless world.\u201d A digital migration of epic proportions is underway. Each refugee has a smartphone and knows his or her desired destination.From this New Europe to New Hampshire, unpredictable forces are at play. Show me a Donald Trump, even a slightly Iowa-humbled one, and I\u2019ll see you with a Marine Le Pen.The strange thing is this troubled Europe has rescued the United States. That\u2019s new. Without Merkel\u2019s courageous decision to take in 1.1 million refugees last year, Europe would have faced catastrophe \u2014 and America, even in an election year, could not have ignored violent mayhem among its allies as borders closed and \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free\u201d were cast adrift.Another 65,000 refugees arrived in Germany in January, setting the country on course for 780,000 more this year. Some 200,000 mainly Muslim children are entering German schools. Imagine if America, which has four times the German population, were to register 800,000 mainly Muslim children in schools in a few months. On reflection, don\u2019t even try.Nobody knows what Germany\u2019s limit is. But there is one. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union will turn on her if the numbers keep rising. Other European nations are not going to take significant quotas: There\u2019s scant democratic support for the right and ethical thing to do.So Germany has to cut a deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The deal will probably see Turkey getting piles of cash \u2014 and perhaps the visa waiver that Turks desperately want from Germany \u2014 in exchange for Turkey strictly curtailing the flow of refugees to an agreed number who would not have to risk their lives in flimsy boats.Turkish politics have become German domestic politics. A troubled Europe, cast loose from America, slouches toward Ankara to be saved.Advertisement"}

Mr. Cruz has spoken occasionally of his half sister Miriam. She was nine years older \u00e2\u0080\u0094 beautiful, smart and charming, he said, and kind enough to let Mr. Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u009cpull on her hair nonstop.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, Rafael, had divorced Miriam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother. Miriam remained forever bitter, Mr. Cruz said, and abused drugs and alcohol. She stole his allowance money. She married a man who had been in and out of jail. She had a son named Joey. She went to jail herself.When she was out, Mr. Cruz and his father tried to track her down at a crack house in Philadelphia. They left their valuables behind, Mr. Cruz said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were driving to a crack house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the crowd on Thursday. \u201cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was going to happen there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey retrieved her and went to a diner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe kept going on and on. She was angry. She said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Daddy missed my swim meet when I was in high school.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz reminded her that she had a son, he said. She would not hear it.Mr. Cruz said he took a $20,000 cash advance on a credit card to put his nephew in boarding school.For a time, Miriam improved, he said. But in 2011, she died of an overdose.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer son found her in her bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said softly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe coroner ruled it accidental. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never know. We just got the call one day that Miriam was gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe church crowd was quiet.For Mr. Cruz, whose stump speech tends toward unsubtle zeal and frequent humor, it was a moment delivered in a different key. The issue of addiction has had particular resonance in New Hampshire, an epicenter of the heroin epidemic, and several candidates have addressed the crisis on the trail.The hushed tones did not last.In a jarring pivot to the more familiar red meat of his campaign pitch, Mr. Cruz assailed opponents who he said were unwilling to secure the Mexican border. He spoke of building a wall. He told an oft-repeated joke that those crossing the border illegally were \u201cundocumented Democrats.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Cruz mocked Sean Penn for his interview with the drug kingpin known as El Chapo.\u201cWhat a cute and chic thing to celebrate, someone who murders and destroys lives for a living,\u201d he said. In a round-table discussion after his remarks, with the local police chief and addiction experts, Mr. Cruz said that while he supported a Senate program to direct some funds to antidrug efforts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be the government that solves this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He emphasized the importance of groups on the ground, including churches and charities.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

While we are now able to look forward to a new beginning, there is still much that needs to be done so that the community and the larger public can be welcomed back to their refuge. We will be available, at the request of the FBI, to help in the long and painstaking job of processing the crime scene, and will be working to assess and repair damages caused by the occupation. Above all, we will begin to revitalize our deep connections in the local community and resume the dialog that has made Malheur a model of collaborative conservation.\nMalheur National Wildlife Refuge is a place for families. Spring is one of the best times of year to view birds returning to the Refuge to rest, eat, and raise their families. The annual Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is an example of how the local community, the Refuge, and many other partners work together to highlight the result of their collaborative conservation efforts and bring tourism dollars into the county. From birdwatching and photography to hiking and camping to hunting and fishing, the Refuge provides a lot of opportunity for visitors. For every $1 dollar the Refuge spends, the community sees $7.02 in economic benefits. An open letter to our friends, our supporters, and many curious about what\u2019s going on here.Many have asked us to comment on the ongoing situation at Malheur NWR. We have refrained because we care deeply for the community, and want to ensure our words do not inflame an already heated situation. However, we believe it is important that our views and position are known.We believe many in the media (as well as those sympathetic to the illegal occupiers) were surprised to hear that the community\u00e2\u0080\u0094while frustrated with the Hammond situation\u00e2\u0080\u0094did not leap to the support of the militants. We are not surprised.For over 100 years, our Refuge employees have been members of this community. We study, watch our kids play basketball, worship, commune, and interact with our fellow Harney County citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098we vs. they\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094but as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099In a community with nearly 40% of working adults engaged in some form of government, we are all touched or involved in the public process. In Harney County, that means we talk. We have cups of coffee. We have arguments. Together we knit our brows, and together we knit scarves. We understand what those currently occupying the Refuge don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand\u2014that Harney County isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid of tough talk.We can have effective disagreements and either find resolution, find compromise, or simply agree to disagree. But we do it with respect for the rule of law, and know that our areas of agreement and cooperation are infinitely more powerful than the differences we may face. Mostly, we face those differences together with open dialogue and open gates\u00e2\u0080\u0094not intimidation and threats. We have access to each other, because we are not afraid to confront difficult situations or have difficult conversations.It pains each of us that we are missing our obligations to you\u00e2\u0080\u0094as church leaders, as 4-H advisers, as friends, and as school volunteers.

{"Headline": "Conspiracy Theories About Zika Spread Through Brazil With the Virus", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byLike Zika itself, rumors about it have replicated with viral ferocity through social media and word of mouth, frustrating the Brazilian authorities as they grapple with a poorly understood pathogen whose origins and implications are still something of a mystery. With many of the rumors started and spread abroad, Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry has been scrambling to do damage control.In a statement on Monday, the government noted that microcephaly, which causes brain damage, was also growing in communities that did not use the larvicide, pyriproxyfen, and declared bluntly, \u201cThe association between the use of pyriproxyfen and microcephaly has no scientific basis.\u201dGraham B. White, a medical entomologist who is a consultant to the United States Defense Department on disease-carrying insects, called the Argentine doctors\u2019 assertion \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnot credible.\u201dHere is a look at the most prominent rumors and theories about Zika virus, along with responses from scientists.Mr. White said that the larvicide did not work through the nervous system, the part of the developing fetus affected by microcephaly. He noted that it had been approved by the World Health Organization and had been widely used for years to treat drinking water in places where mosquitoes breed.Brazil, where mistrust of government is high, is fertile ground for such theories to gain traction.Nailma Souza, 40, who owns a nail salon in Salvador, a city that has been hit hard by the outbreak, is certain that Zika was concocted to divert attention away from a cure for cancer that the authorities want to keep secret.(Another vaccine-related theory: A bad batch of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine failed to protect against rubella, and the increase in cases of microcephaly was caused by an unreported rubella outbreak, not by Zika.)Claudio Maierovitch, the Brazilian Health Ministry\u2019s director of surveillance of communicable diseases, said there was a danger that fear and scant scientific information would lead people to ignore the government\u2019s exhortations about protecting themselves from mosquito bites and removing standing water that allows mosquitoes to breed.\u201cEverything about Zika is new, and there is an aura of mystery about it, which leaves everyone open to new stories and new ideas about where it came from,\u201d Dr. Maierovitch said. \u201cThe biggest risk is that people don\u2019t do enough preventive procedures because they don\u2019t believe Zika is dangerous or that the disease even exists.\u201dMichel Misse, a sociologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said that rumors and conspiracy theories played an outsize role in Brazilian society, and that the spate of crises buffeting the Brazilian government made people question and doubt authority.\u201cGiven the political moment we are living in,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot of people are not happy with our government, and it definitely plays a role when it comes to believing rumors that blame the government for things that are going wrong.\u201dIn December, the Brazilian government introduced a \u201cFacts and Rumors\u201d website that sought to tackle head-on a dizzying variety of far-fetched stories circulating on the Internet.Among them are claims that \u201can army\u201d of Haitian refugees escaping the devastating 2010 earthquake there sought to overthrow Brazil\u2019s government, that the official retirement age was being raised to 95 and that President Dilma Rousseff was overseeing a plan to insert microchips into Brazilian citizens.\u201cDo not share lies!\u201d warns the website, which asks people to send the authorities the sources of wacky stories they see online. \u201cThat way, you\u2019re helping to build a country based on truth and justice.\u201dWhy scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.\u201cIt\u2019s fantasy,\u201d Hadyn Parry, Oxitec\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cIf children weren\u2019t involved and people weren\u2019t getting sick, it would be quite an amusing fantasy, but this is quite serious and irresponsible.\u201d\u201cIf politicians start pandering to those opposed to genetically modified mosquitoes without scientific basis to their arguments,\u201d warned Tanjim Hossain, a research fellow at the University of Miami who specializes in mosquito control, \u201cthey are going to end up really hurting people.\u201dStuck trying to sort out truth from fiction are people like Flora Costa Lima, 34, who was waiting to see a doctor at Salvador\u2019s largest public hospital the other day. Ms. Costa Lima, a lawyer, said she was spraying her 18-month-old daughter with repellent every two hours and was rethinking whether to have another child soon.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that expired vaccines are what\u2019s causing microcephaly in babies,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but there is no way I would get pregnant right now. I think it\u2019s best to wait.\u201dReporting was contributed by Sofia Perpetua from Salvador, Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro, Donald G.

It is beyond my comprehension that in the year 2016, in the United States of America, we are poisoning our children.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne person in the crowd shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo to Flint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Mr. Sanders said he had talked to parents who were witnessing the heartbreaking effects of tainted water on their children.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just talked to a mother who said that she has a kid who was very bright in school,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the last two years, she has seen her child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to do school work markedly deteriorate. Can you imagine being a mother, seeing your own baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, you own child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intellectual development deteriorate in front of your very eyes? That is happening all over that city.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome in the crowd loudly sighed, shook their heads and frowned as the senator explained the conversation with Flint residents. Several people also held signs up that read, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlintstones 810 for Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFix Flint Now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders said that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be \u00e2\u0080\u009coverly political\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that he had called for the resignation of Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the local government cannot protect those children, if the state government cannot protect those children, then the federal government better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Sanders said he wanted to create a jobs program that would help fix some of the crumbling infrastructure problems. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll over America, communities are struggling with deteriorating water systems, waste-water plants, airports, rail systems, roads, bridges, levees and dams,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe can create 13 million decent-paying jobs rebuilding that infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders also talked about issues at the core of his candidacy, including the need to change a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrupt campaign finance system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to regulate Wall Street and to deal with economic, social and racial inequality. Many in the crowd, now familiar with his stump speech and Brooklyn accent, shouted along as he spoke.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have today a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to cheers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a system in which a small number of people, very small number of people, are making huge campaign contributions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYuuuuge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the crowd shouted back.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuuuuge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders repeated, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how I am going to use that word again. Every time I say it, 10,000 people are going to echo it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders wrapped up his rally by turning his attention to the Supreme Court opening created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and to Senate Republicans who have said they will not schedule any votes on Obama nominees.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say to my colleagues in the United States Senate, my Republican colleagues who today, unfortunately, are in the majority: You talk about the constitution a whole lot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell how about obeying the constitution and start holding hearings when President Obama nominates the next Supreme Court justice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk about obstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere you have the Constitution, it is clear as clear can be. The president of the United States nominates people to the Supreme Court. Republicans start hearings on his nomination. Do not obstruct. Obey the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen asked why Mr. Sanders didn\u2019t travel to Flint on Monday, the senator\u2019s spokesperson, Michael Briggs, said, \u201cThe senator preferred to meet quietly today with seven or eight people impacted by the unbelievable, horrific situation in Flint without making a media show out of it.\u201dMr. Briggs added that Mr. Sanders \u201cwanted to hear what they had to say without television cameras, and what they had to say was unbelievable and hard to imagine in 21st century America.\u201dMr. Briggs also said that Mr. Sanders will travel to Flint in the \u201cvery near future because the people he met with today urged him to come see firsthand what ground zero looks like.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "By Disclosing Tax Data, Rivals Pressure Donald Trump to Do the Same", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Putting heft behind their calls for Donald J. Trump to release his income tax filings, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have now made public some details of their own taxes.But the disclosures on Saturday by the first-term senators turned out to be just simple summaries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the first two pages of their 1040 forms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving many of the specifics to the imagination, and perhaps blunting their efforts to draw a contrast with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of transparency.The forms posted by Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz essentially offer some basic totals for items such as adjusted gross income and taxes paid. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing is the granular information about their investments, sources of income, domestic help and itemized deductions for such things as mortgages and charitable contributions.He added, \u201cWho knows what tax shelters these guys are investing in?\u201dThe campaigns, for their part, say they have provided enough information to strike a comparison with Mr. Trump, at least for now.Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman, Alex Conant, said that the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release was consistent with what the senator provided during his 2010 Senate campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have not ruled out releasing additional information in the future, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Conant said.Mr. Cruz, who released complete federal returns during his 2012 Senate bid, said he had essentially followed Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead this time around. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just did it to match what the other candidates are doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz told reporters in Little Rock, Ark., on Saturday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a competitive race. There needs to be transparency.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Donald Trump is refusing to hand over his returns. That is unprecedented in presidential politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe disclosure of income tax returns has long been a much-discussed issue in presidential campaigns, and it is often used as a political wedge by candidates during crucial moments.Last year, Jeb Bush looked to get out ahead of questions about his own income and taxes as he posted online a thick stack of 1040 forms dating to 1980, showing that he and his wife had an adjusted gross income of more than $28 million since he left the governor\u2019s office at the start of 2007. As he made the information public, Mr. Bush bragged that he had put out some 1,150 pages, \u201cmore than any presidential candidate in history.\u201d Some of the older returns had been previously released during Mr. Bush\u2019s campaigns for governor.Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns showed that he and his wife, Jeanette, earned an average adjusted gross income of $458,000 a year from 2010 to 2014. Based on other disclosures, that figure would include Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Senate salary of $174,000, proceeds of book deals, as well as income from Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part-time teaching job and Mrs. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consulting work, which includes advising Norman Braman, a supporter of Mr. Rubio, on his charitable giving.Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston, reported adjusted gross income averaging about $1.25 million a year from 2011 to 2014. Their income includes his Senate salary, his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income and earnings from a book deal.Both senators released the tax forms after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns emerged as a campaign issue last week when Mr. Romney suggested that there might be a hidden \u00e2\u0080\u009cbombshell\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the businessman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns.Mr. Trump originally promised to disclose his taxes, but then, during Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, he said he could not do so while he was still being audited. He also said he believed he was targeted by the Internal Revenue Service because of his Christian beliefs.The I.R.S. said in a statement that it was precluded from discussing individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tax matters, but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeparate from their tax forms, candidates for president are required to file personal financial disclosure statements providing details of their assets and sources of income.Mr. Trump filed financial disclosures in July, releasing a 92-page statement that included extensive data on his business engagements and sources of income. The filing showed that Mr. Trump had earned at least $380 million in the previous 18 months. How that income will ultimately square with the information on his personal income taxes, however, is unclear.Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!Those financial statements showed that about half of Mr. Trump\u2019s income, roughly $200 million, was attributable to golf courses and resorts. About a quarter of his income was attributable to the sales of condominiums or rental fees.Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "My Secret Policeman", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 \u201cMiss Mona, welcome home. The airport told us you\u2019ve just returned from Vienna.\u201dI knew from the \u201cprivate caller\u201d ID that appeared on my phone that it was National Security calling to remind me \u2014 as if I\u2019d forgotten \u2014 that they kept tabs on me. I had indeed just returned to Cairo from months abroad promoting my book, but Vienna had not been on my itinerary. That was a reminder, too, of the incompetence that laces even the sinister in Egypt.The officer, who identified himself by rank and first name only, did correctly name other places I had visited, including some I had not mentioned on my Twitter feed. That led me to believe the agency also monitors networks like WhatsApp and FaceTime chats that I use for private communications.\u201cWe just wanted to check in with you,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you visit Israel? We\u2019re calling you because you used to live in Israel. Has anyone offered you any work?\u201dI was a Reuters correspondent in Jerusalem years earlier, from 1997 to 1999. Egypt and Israel have been at peace since the 1979 Camp David peace treaty; even so, Egyptians who visit Israel are regarded with suspicion and are often subjected to questioning upon return. I told the officer that I would not answer his questions unless my attorney was present, and ended the call.This was my second phone call in three months. In September, on the pretext that they were \u201cupdating\u201d their records, Officer Rank and First Name wanted to know whom I worked for and if I had any trips planned. I was visiting my parents that day, so they sent a low-ranking foot soldier with a phone through which I spoke to the officer. I got the message: They knew where to find me.He asked me if I had moved back to Egypt permanently. \u201cWhy are you asking me questions you know the answers to?\u201d I replied.I joke with friends that a phone call is a promotion of sorts. From the start of my journalism career in Egypt in the early 1990s, I joined the many journalists and activists who are surveilled by the government. Sometimes, a state security officer would send a note inviting me to tea \u2014 what a perfect euphemism for an interrogation \u2014 at headquarters.For my first invitation to tea with the agency then known as the State Security Investigations Service \u2014 or just State Security, as we called it \u2014 two officers escorted me from the Reuters Cairo bureau, where I was a correspondent, to their headquarters. There, I was threatened with a night in jail if I didn\u2019t reveal the source of a story. I refused, and after a few hours I was released with the backhanded patriarchal compliment \u201cYou\u2019re a tough girl.\u201dState Security as Big Daddy took on a whole new meaning when I returned to Cairo after my stint in Jerusalem. When I went in for \u201ctea,\u201d I had my very own assigned officer, who had given himself the nom de guerre of Omar Sharif (no relation, absolutely no resemblance).\u201cMona Eltahawy! Finally! You\u2019re a real character!\u201d Mr. Sharif exclaimed. \u201cWho on earth goes to Israel? I have to meet your father. If my daughter ever told me she wanted to go to Israel I\u2019d break her neck!\u201dSitting across a desk from Omar Sharif as he held up files he said were full of information gleaned from my being followed and from my phone\u2019s being tapped was bad enough. But our encounter turned Kafka-esque when he took out a photograph of his wife, a woman in a head scarf who he said was a religious instructor in a local mosque.\u201cAre you married? How old are you? A woman like you can never get married,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to want to marry you with the life you lead, every day in a different city? You\u2019ll end up with a man like my brother, a womanizer, who\u2019ll cheat on you.\u201dA few months later, while I was visiting some relatives, together with my parents and my sister who had come from out of town, the telephone rang. It was Omar Sharif.He knew my father was in Cairo, and demanded to speak to him, too. The next day, my father told me that Mr. Sharif had said that I lived a life \u201cthat was not suitable for Egypt.\u201dAlthough the organization existed before the nearly 30-year regime of President Hosni Mubarak, it became one of the myriad civilian security services he used to keep a seesaw balance with the rival power of the military. For a brief period, in 2011, after we turned out Mr. Mubarak and wrong-footed the old men who run Egypt, the State Security Investigations Service was abolished.I am lucky because I am a known writer whose profile protects her. National Security\u2019s combination of viciousness and incompetence leans hardest on those with the least protection: the young and the anonymous. These days, Egypt\u2019s youth can\u2019t expect an invitation to tea.Advertisement"}

But typically such announcements are a suspension of a candidacy or an endorsement of someone else. Mr. Santorum has been critical of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas recently and appeared last week at a rally Donald J. Trump held while skipping the most recent Republican debate.The planned announcements by Mr. Santorum, 57, will come just hours after Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky pulled out of the race.Mr. Santorum narrowly won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, edging out Mitt Romney, but his campaign never caught fire this time around, and he came in 11th in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses.In 2012, Mr. Santorum, a Roman Catholic and the father of seven children (an eighth died as an infant), ran his campaign on a shoestring budget, driving around the state in a pickup truck, dressed in his famed sweater vest. Mr. Santorum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-line conservative stances, like his opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights, helped endear him to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deeply religious voters, as did his youngest daughter, Bella, who was born with a rare genetic disorder.This time around, Mr. Santorum completed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFull Grassley\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 visiting all of Iowa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 99 counties, in a feat named after the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior senator, Charles E.

{"Headline": "No Love Lost Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Supporters", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 Speaking just six miles apart on Friday morning, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas renewed their bitter personal feud, while their supporters echoed the candidates\u2019 language and themes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a sign that the bitterness between the two men has now seeped deeply into the feelings of voters.      Mr. Trump called Mr. Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe biggest liar I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen,\u201d a line he has been pushing all week. Trump supporters, some of whom said they had once considered supporting the Texas senator, largely agreed with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harsh assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very disappointed in Ted Cruz because of the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going after other opponents, and some of the things I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think were actually fair,\u201d said Ken Ivey, a retired contractor who waited in line to hear Mr. Trump.  Earlier in the day, Mr. Cruz mocked Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vague generalities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098make America great again,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u201d he told supporters in a room overlooking the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you understand what made America great in the first place?\u00e2\u0080\u009dAn attendee, Mike Loebs, echoed his candidate, complaining of Mr. Trump, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all yadda yadda yadda.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has nothing specific,\u201d added Mr. Loebs, who retired after 30 years in the Navy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bully. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with him, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fat, dumb or ugly.\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump is a complete disaster,\u201d said another Cruz supporter, John Allen, a retired salesman.Mary Jane Duke, who attended the Trump rally, said of Mr. Cruz: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not an honest man in my opinion. The fact checks show he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely telling lies.\u201dThe acrimony, not just between the candidates but their base supporters as well, could have significant consequences, both in the short and long term.With polls showing that as many as 25 percent of Republican voters in South Carolina could still change their minds before the primary on Saturday, the deeply negative feelings Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz have planted in the hearts of voters means neither candidate is likely to pick up support from the other team. That could make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida the beneficiary of any defectors, or of any fence-sitters who are simply sick of negative campaigning. And the Cruz-Trump animosity could also portend long-term difficulties for the Republican Party if one of them becomes the nominee and strong negative impressions remain among the other\u2019s supporters.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was somewhat of a fan of Cruz, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been lately,\u201d said Steve Armendt, who has a kitchen countertop business in Myrtle Beach and attended the Trump rally.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slinging mud against Trump.\u201dMr. Trump, who on Friday dropped any criticism of Pope Francis after the pope clarified remarks questioning Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faith, returned to the more familiar target of Mr. Cruz, whom he has bitterly attacked since the Texas senator won the Iowa caucuses this month. Once again, Mr. Trump accused the Cruz campaign of stealing the Iowa victory by claiming that day, incorrectly, that Ben Carson was dropping out.

Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have been fighting aggressively for anti-establishment voters in South Carolina, including the many evangelical Christians.Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tactics, to judge by Trump supporters, may have tarnished the candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor somebody like Cruz who professes to be such a strong Christian, to lob those kinds of personal attacks, it seems hypocritical to me,\u201d said Tim McClellan, a facilities manager, who waited in a half-mile line to see Mr. Trump at the Myrtle Beach Sports Center.A television ad Mr. Cruz is running attacking Mr. Trump with old footage of him voicing support for abortion lead Mr. Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The threat drove some Cruz supporters even more firmly into the senator\u2019s camp. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he made a big mistake threatening to do that, because Senator Cruz is an outstanding attorney who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s represented cases before the Supreme Court,\u201d said Randy Riddle, a retired Presbyterian pastor at the Cruz rally.   Jim Witzigman, a retiree, had narrowed it down to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, but said he now favored Mr. Cruz. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump was talking about his sister being a Supreme Court nominee and says he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what her views are; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy that,\u201d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know she voted to overturn the ban on partial birth abortion in New Jersey.\u201dOutside the Trump rally, Bill Waters was dressed as a construction worker and held a sign reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Ready to Work on the Wall.\u201d In his day job, Mr. Waters said, he dresses as the Statue of Liberty and stands outside a tax preparation firm.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose if you vote for Cruz,\u201d he chanted to people waiting to enter the event.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Monthly Gift That Keeps on Not Giving", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerThe Haggler does not go camping, nor does he hike. He should probably claim that he is too busy protecting consumers to engage in an activity as frivolous as tromping through the woods and gaping at trees. But it is simpler than that. He doesn\u2019t like the woods. He figures that his ancestors spent a lot of time in the woods wishing that they lived somewhere else. Like a city.But apparently, some people love camping, and some of them love it so much they have signed up for a subscription service called Campbox. It works like other subscription box services, which mail a collection of thematically related stuff, at set intervals, to subscribers. In this case, the theme is camping gear and a new box is mailed every month.Theoretically.MATTHEW NAULT, PITTSBURGHThe Haggler\u2019s first thought was that anyone who suffered heartache because of Campbox needs the kind of help that doesn\u2019t come in the mail. But the B.B.B. does not take such matters lightly. It ended the release by recommending that angry subscribers contact the police in Greenville County, S.C., where Campbox is based.It seemed possible that the people behind Campbox had simply decided to take whatever subscription money they had collected and high-tail it to Bimini. But its Facebook page is still bustling with posts, and its website still beckons.\u201cOutdoor Gear Delivered Monthly,\u201d says its home page, over a photograph of snow-covered trees. Below that, visitors are urged to sign up and \u201cbe the greatest gift giver ever.\u201dIn the Haggler\u2019s view, there are two essential requirements for great gift giving. First, a gift. Second, greatness. But when Campbox actually delivers a gift, it has not always provided greatness. A subscription-box review site, mysubscriptionaddiction.com, was less than thrilled with products that arrived in October of last year. This included exotic brands of beef jerky, soap, drip coffee bags and something called a Luminaid PackLite 12 Solar Lantern.At least the reviewer got something. Around Christmastime and in the weeks that followed, a number of subscribers stated in various places online that Campbox had not sent anything and was not returning calls or emails. When the B.B.B. tried to contact the founder of the company, a man named Demo Bailey, it heard nothing.So the Haggler tried. A few hours after writing to Campbox\u2019s email address, Mr. Bailey replied with a courteous, even chipper, email, asking how he could help. The Haggler forwarded Mr. Nault\u2019s email. The same day, Mr. Bailey wrote to say that he had issued a refund and would send a complimentary box to Mr. Nault. Great.The Haggler then asked for a call from Mr. Bailey, to get a sense of what exactly had produced these angry, boxless customers. A few days of silence followed, but on Monday, the Haggler nudged, and Mr. Bailey called.\u201cI thought I had a pretty good system set up,\u201d he said early in a half-hour conversation, \u201cbut my customer service was definitely lacking.\u201dIt was lacking because Mr. Bailey, a 28-year-old camping enthusiast, runs Campbox by himself, out of his house in Greenville, S.C. A self-described \u201csolopreneur,\u201d he started the company in May 2014 and, aside from some occasional help from friends, he runs everything. He manages the website, purchases from vendors, processes orders and ships boxes. It is a lot of work, and Mr. Bailey has another job, as a coder, to help pay the bills.To complicate matters, he was unprepared for an influx of orders in December because he figured that interest in camping waned in the winter. What he forgot is that Christmas and Hanukkah are in December. New orders poured in, more than 26 of them on one particularly busy day.\u201cI kind of underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was exciting but a wake-up call.\u201dThe Haggler got the impression that Mr. Bailey had dreamed up an idea that caught on a lot faster than he had anticipated. He was especially unprepared for negative customer postings online, or the attention of the Better Business Bureau, which he promised to contact last Tuesday. As of Friday, he had not called.When furious emails arrived in January, he didn\u2019t have a system to deal with those customers expeditiously. Mr. Nault\u2019s email, for instance, was never read. It was part of a pileup of correspondence languishing in Mr. Bailey\u2019s email account.Mr. Bailey is now talking about hiring someone full time, or even bringing in a partner. More remarkably, he is talking about expanding his product line, adding Campbox for kids.\u201cIt would be a smaller box, more colorful, and I\u2019d partner with some camps,\u201d he said.The Haggler would recommend that Campbox learn how to execute for the customers it already has before adding new ones. But it takes nerve to start your own business, and say this for Mr. Bailey: The guy has a lot of nerve.Advertisement"}

Trump is in position to sweep to victories in the Alabama and Oklahoma primaries on Tuesday, according to a new polls that show strong support from evangelical Christians potentially helping him win a big haul of delegates.If Mr. Trump wins more than 50 percent of the vote, he would take all of Alabama\u2019s at-large delegates. Otherwise, they will be divided proportionally among candidates who win at least 20 percent of the vote.A similar outcome is in play in Oklahoma, where Mr. Trump has a smaller lead over Mr. Cruz. Mr. Trump has the support of 35 percent of likely Republican voters there, with Mr. Cruz in second place with 23 percent and the rest of the field stuck in single digits. A candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to secure delegates in Oklahoma.In both states, Mr. Trump is doing well with evangelical voters. He tops Mr. Rubio among evangelicals by a margin of 43 percent to 18 percent in Alabama, and he is deadlocked with Mr. Cruz in Oklahoma.The states are split on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton holds a large lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in Alabama, with 71 percent of likely Democratic voters supporting her and 23 percent planning to back him. In Oklahoma, Mr. Sanders leads Mrs. Clinton by five percentage points, within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.If those numbers hold, it would be a reversal from 2008, where Mrs. Clinton lost to Senator Barack Obama in Alabama, but won Oklahoma.

{"Headline": "Chris Christie Endorses Donald Trump and Calls Marco Rubio \u2018Desperate\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this month, endorsed Donald J. Trump for president on Friday.The endorsement interrupted a 48-hour assault from an emboldened Mr. Rubio, who is adopting many of the real estate mogul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crude tactics and colorful insults as he urgently tries to arrest Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s march to the Republican nomination.In the span of a few hours across Texas, Mr. Rubio suggested that Mr. Trump had urinated in his trousers and used illegal immigrants to tap out his unceasing Twitter messages. Mr. Trump countered by suggesting that Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excessive perspiration had no place in the White House and brandishing a water bottle to mock the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chronic thirst.Waving the bottle across a stage at a Texas rally, pouring half its contents onto the floor and then taking giant gulps from it, Mr. Trump ridiculed his younger rival with exaggerated facial gestures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rubio!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted to loud applause and cheers.The escalation arrived four days before the biggest day of voting in the Republican primary campaign, and amid mounting alarm within the leadership of the party that its rank-and-file voters keep embracing a figure they view as hostile to their values and unworthy of their nomination.Mr. Rubio seemed to relish his new role as a mischievous and combative saboteur, theatrically reading Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misspelled online postings in front of an audience in Dallas and describing what he said was Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s descent into anxiety-ridden sweatiness backstage in between commercial breaks at their debate Thursday night.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was having a meltdown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said, pacing a raised platform in what at times felt like a stand-up routine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was applying makeup around his mustache, because he had one of those sweat mustaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe crowd roared.Having tried and failed in so many ways to catch fire this campaign season, Mr. Rubio portrayed Mr. Trump as a con man who has tricked Republicans into believing he is an honest businessman and a genuine conservative.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is pulling the ultimate con job on the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to unmask him for what he is.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Mr. Rubio did not count on Mr. Christie, a totem of the Northeastern Republican establishment, bolting to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side on Friday and delivering the businessman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest endorsement.In doing so, Mr. Christie openly defied Republican attempts to isolate Mr. Trump as an unsavory party crasher and handed the front-runner an inexhaustible, media-savvy surrogate who on Friday pledged to travel the country campaigning for Mr. Trump and savaging his rivals.Mr. Christie wasted little time in pursuing Mr. Rubio, a first-term Florida senator whom he holds in contempt for stealing his donors, kneecapping his campaign with brutal ads in New Hampshire and repeatedly surpassing him in the polls.Brushing off Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pugnacious turn, Mr. Christie derided it as a fake, consultant-driven performance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of his talking points now is to be entertaining and smile a lot now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one act after another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBehind the scenes, Mr. Trump had diligently courted Mr. Christie over the phone and in person over the past few weeks, despite the billionaire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent dismissal of endorsements and the blandishments required to obtain them.During a joint appearance in Fort Worth, Mr. Christie described his support as a gesture of loyalty to an old friend and an assessment of who stood the best chance of defeating the Democratic nominee in November.But Mr. Trump seemed fixated, above all, on Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talent for bludgeoning opponents such as Mr. Rubio, as he did during a Republican debate a few weeks ago by seizing on his penchant for robotic repetition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought he was going to die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump observed, as Mr. Christie stood to his side. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood going, Chris,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Aghast party elders expressed dismay over the alliance, calling it a political marriage of expedience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Lord almighty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania and secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, who is backing Gov. John Kasich.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the walls and bridges team,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he quipped.The timing of the Christie-Trump partnership immediately (and, it seemed, strategically) distracted from a growing liability for Mr. Trump: demands from Republican rivals and leaders that he release his tax returns, which Mr. Trump has rebuffed with claims that he is being audited.As the scatological schoolyard taunts passed back and forth on Friday, slack-jawed voters struggled to contain their shock.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Emily Post would be totally just turning in her grave right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tammy Ross, 52, after attending a rally for Mr. Rubio in Oklahoma City on Friday afternoon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyone can say anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she tsk-tsked.Cable news anchors fumbled for words sufficient to describe what they were hearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh. My. God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d declared John Berman of CNN, after hearing Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vivisection of Mr. Trump in Dallas, which included this description of why the developer needed a full-length mirror backstage during the debate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe to make sure his pants weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wet. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio cracked.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d declared his startled co-host, Kate Bolduan.As Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio exchanged blistering broadsides, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas at times seemed to be an afterthought. Amid the caustic exchanges, Mr. Cruz discussed the finer points of federal water regulations during a taped interview in Nashville and engaged in an online war of words about immigration with Dennis Rodman, the retired basketball star.Mr. Rodman managed to maintain the tenor of the day.In his own message, he acknowledged that Mr. Trump, on his hit NBC reality show, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Apprentice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d had indeed fired him. Deploying an expletive, Mr. Rodman warned Mr. Cruz that the businessman would soon dispatch with him as well.Mr. Rodman ended with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign battle cry: \u00e2\u0080\u009c#MakeAmericaGreatAgain.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy MICHAEL BARBAROEvery political marriage involves a bit of calculation, and in the case of the Christie-Trump endorsement, both men have much to gain.By ALEXANDER BURNS and MAGGIE HABERMANAs mainstream Republicans try to stop Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise, the specter of being bullied by him is discouraging others from joining the fight.By STEPHANIE SAULThe now-defunct Trump University, subject of a Marco Rubio attack at the Republican debate, is embroiled in lawsuits accusing it of misrepresentation.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The Argentine artist Amalia Ulman\u2019s \u201cExcellences and Perfections\u201d series, completed in 2014 and 2015, was originally a sequence of updates on Instagram, and is presented here as mounted prints.Ms. Ulman photographed herself in assumed roles \u2014 exposing her midriff, or in a bathroom ready for an evening out \u2014 as a commentary on how women construct their identities on social networks.\u201cIt was an illustration on how femininity can be something fabricated and not biological,\u201d Ms. Ulman said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was my first attempt to work with fiction using social media, to also demonstrate that there is no authenticity online.\u201dThe displays of works that exist \u2014 and are accessible \u2014 online raise questions about the need for a gallery at all. In one such work, \u201cGeoGoo,\u201d a 2008 hack of Google platforms including Maps by the artistic duo JODI, symbols swirl in geometric patterns across digital landscapes.\u201cA lot of these digital pieces continue to evolve after the exhibition finishes,\u201d said Hans-Ulrich Obrist, a co-director of the Serpentine Gallery and an advocate for pioneering digital art projects. To do so, he said, they might require the involvement of programmers as well as a \u201csustained infrastructure\u201d that would allow modifications.\u201cElectronic Superhighway\u201d concludes with historic pieces, including some that use now-obsolete technologies like VHS and vinyl records alongside the likes of screen-printing and 16 millimeter film depicting computer-influenced forms like grids and circuitry.Among the standout works are two pieces by the influential video artist Nam June Paik. The towering \u201cInternet Dream,\u201d from 1994, a stack of 52 monitors displaying jarring abstract images, heralds the current age of digital information saturation. The 1984 video work \u201cGood Morning, Mr. Orwell,\u201d originally a multinational broadcast, features cameos by celebrities like Laurie Anderson and George Plimpton set to music by Peter Gabriel, Philip Glass and John Cage.So why has it taken so long for such a broad survey? Mr. Kholeif said that presenting a critical mass of digital works was costly, time-consuming and had often been relegated to specialist galleries. \u201cMuseums haven\u2019t tended to do it,\u201d he said.Mr. Coupland said that many mainstream institutions tended to play down the importance of art influenced by the Internet. \u201cMany people, mostly older, don\u2019t get it and are alienated by it,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a divide out there.\u201dMr. Obrist pointed to Mr. Paik\u2019s career as a model for younger artists working in digital media. The Korean-American\u2019s first solo exhibition in 1963, in which he presented his signature modified television sets, came many years after the invention of the technology that made it possible, and his works found acceptance only slowly.\u201cMoving image was always relegated to the cinema,\u201d Mr. Obrist said, and as an art form was seen as subordinate to painting and sculpture. But, he said, curators have successfully challenged that assumption.\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d he added, \u201cis that it always takes time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He added that he was looking to increase his work force by about a third.Nor has the downturn changed life at Gusto, a payroll management start-up. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the shift,\u201d said Joshua Reeves, a founder of the company. \u201cEven in downturns, some businesses succeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always the other guy who will suffer,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has invested in the ride-hailing company Uber and the food-delivery start-up Munchery. \u201cI\u2019m no psychologist, but all the people we\u2019ve backed have never been average. They never think the things that happen to average people will happen to them.\u201dEntrepreneurs\u2019 confidence levels remain buoyant even though investors are telling them that the change from go-go-go times to merely go-go will have consequences.The message from Rory O\u2019Driscoll, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, that entrepreneurs should be more careful is often ignored.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a company where the pullback in funding hasn\u2019t been discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a person has had a conversation about this 10 times and it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet\u2026 \u201dMr. O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s voice trailed off. \u201cI\u2019m tired and grumpy because I\u2019ve had three of these conversations today and in every one you have the same discussion,\u201d he said.For now, start-up entrepreneurs are operating much as they did during the recent boom times. Data from Jobvite, a recruiting service used by start-ups, show no drop in hiring activity or salaries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Well-appointed offices that look like photo shoots for Design Within Reach and perks like free Uber rides and in-house meals remain common at the companies.\u201cThe narrative of start-up comeuppance is in the air, but we haven\u2019t seen a statistically significant change in food budgets,\u201d said Arram Sabeti, the chief executive of ZeroCater, which serves meals to tech companies.In fact, the food from tech companies that goes uneaten is piling up. \u201cTwo years ago, we picked up 15 tons of food a week and now we\u2019re picking up 17 tons a week,\u201d said Mary Risley, whose group Food Runners in San Francisco distributes leftover office food to the city\u2019s homeless residents. She attributes the increase largely to start-ups.\u201cI\u2019ve been reading a lot about a slowdown and asking myself about what it means, but we just closed a substantial round of funding,\u201d said Mr. Mital, characterizing his recent financing as \u201cone of the easiest fund-raisings we\u2019ve had.\u201dThe air of detachment pervades the talk. Shan Sinha, the chief executive of the video conferencing start-up Highfive, said his customers were discussing ways to save money over the coming months. But he said he and his founder friends wonder \u201cwhether what\u2019s happening in the world will have an effect on us.\u201dOther entrepreneurs emphasize that any downturn will be good for them. Less venture capital money should lead to fewer competitors; a less crowded market may also make it easier to recruit talented people. Mr. Reeves, of Gusto, said that if his customers found themselves in financial straits, that would create another great selling point for his company, which can help businesses save money.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see this conversation come up,\u201d Mr. Reeves said. \u201cMost have only known the froth of the cycle. Now it\u2019s time to create companies to solve real problems.\u201d\u201cWhen I bring up issues that could impact the value of their stock, employees want to talk about them,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer based in Palo Alto who counsels individuals about their equity compensation. \u201cLast year there was less concern.\u201dThe message of more caution is not lost on all start-ups. Some are cutting back on expenses, albeit just a little. Jeff Selzer, the manager of Palo Alto Bicycles, a specialty bike store, said he was seeing fewer start-ups build custom $10,000 bicycles as signing bonuses for new managers.Others are going further. Origami Logic, a marketing analytics start-up, held its annual off-site meeting for salespeople last month at a rustic coastal lodge near Santa Cruz, Calif. The company said that other start-ups typically hold such events at luxury hotels in San Francisco or Las Vegas, which can cost twice as much.And Ben Katz, the founder of the mobile banking app Card.com, said he had found ways to save more than 30 percent a month on his company\u2019s computing services bills by using less server space. He is looking to sublet a 100-square-foot space in his office to save $12,000 a year.\u201cIn the past, we wouldn\u2019t have justified taking the time to do little things like that, but now we take time to find ways to grow sustainably,\u201d he said.Still, confidence reigns.\u201cWe can make a compelling case that our software will help save money during a downturn,\u201d said Greg Waldorf, the chief executive of Invoice2go, a start-up based in Silicon Valley and Australia that makes an invoicing app. Another plus, he said, was that his own company did not burn through cash at a fast rate.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s business as usual thanks to how I\u2019ve been leading the company,\u201d Mr. Waldorf said.Advertisement"}

He wrote to Ms. Lee\u2019s address in New York, asking to make a reference to the book in another one of his comic strips, \u201cOutland.\u201d\u201cReally, it was under the pretense of having an excuse to write to her again,\u201d Mr. Breathed, 58, said in an interview. \u201cShe had a role in the very thing that turned into a success later on.\u201dThis time, he had better luck. Ms. Lee, a consummate Southerner, had found his request to be gentlemanly. Her response was just under 300 words, in a letter posted from a post office box in Monroeville, Ala. She typed out the letter on onionskin paper, with correction fluid applied in spots. (\u201cGod, I hate this machine,\u201d she wrote of the typewriter at one point.)\u201cNot quite brain-dead, just absent from my N.Y.C. address to which my agent in all innocence forwarded your letter,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote, by way of explanation for its timing. \u201cShe sometimes has trouble finding me, too.\u201dHis letter was found in one of the piles of envelopes that a neighbor of hers in New York would regularly scoop up and forward along to Alabama: \u201cFrom the volume of mail I get, you\u2019d think \u2018Mockingbird\u2019 was published last year,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cWhat has happened, I think, is that \u2018Mockingbird\u2019 is on its second generation of readers.\u201dThe letters written to the cartoonist Berkeley Breathed from Harper Lee, with notes.Mr. Breathed said, \u201cShe talked about the book in 1994 as if she was still marveling that it was doing so well.\u201dWhile Ms. Lee generally kept things playful with Mr. Breathed, the later letters contain hints of her feelings about growing older and, perhaps, more isolated.\u201cAlthough I get more like Mrs. Gummidge every day,\u201d she said, referring to a lonely widow in Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cDavid Copperfield,\u201d adding, \u201cOpus never ceases to delight me.\u201dMs. Lee, who was in her early 80s at that time, with failing hearing and eyesight and recovering from a stroke, had grown attached to the penguin that padded around Bloom County, and then became the titular character in his own strip, dressed in a bow tie. The lovable and vulnerable Opus, Mr. Breathed said, was always searching for home.\u201cHarper never left home,\u201d Mr. Breathed said, \u201cbut Opus was a penguin in a small town. That\u2019s not where penguins really belong.\u201dWhen she heard that Mr. Breathed planned to retire Opus, Ms. Lee began lobbying, saying that \u201cdepriving him of life is murder.\u201d She added: \u201cA hard word to describe the obliteration of your creation, but Opus is real. He LIVES.\u201dMr. Breathed could barely believe what he was reading: \u201cHow ironic is that here, she is desperately upset that I\u2019m letting my character die for her when millions around the world, for generations, have been upset that she let her characters end?\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Lee\u2019s never publishing another book until the contentious release of \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d last year.She eventually accepted the idea when Mr. Breathed sent her a letter with a drawing of Opus, even turning a bit flirtatious: \u201cMaybe I can find it in my heart (not being old and horrible, but young and beautiful) to forgive you,\u201d she wrote.Mr. Breathed said that he waited to share his letters out of deference to Ms. Lee\u2019s privacy, and added that he would not sell them. They will remain in a safe at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif.\u201cCertainly what she talked about was not terribly intimate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a beautiful, and, I think, tiny little insight into the mind of an artist that so many people love.\u201dAn article on Monday about Harper Lee\u2019s correspondence with the cartoonist Berkeley Breathed misstated her age at the time she wrote a letter to him comparing herself to a Charles Dickens character. She was in her early 80s, not her late 70s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike Have a Big Story (Apple), and Some Scraps", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byBitsI\u2019m curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple\u2019s side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.Here\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.Kanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.That\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.And that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.That\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.Or maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.Advertisement"}

By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones. And iOS8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.Mr. Cook has also been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about government surveillance. Mr. Cook argued that the company sold hardware \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses.For Apple, cooperating with the United States government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally.In China, for example, Apple \u2014 like any other foreign company selling smartphones \u2014 hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China.If Apple accedes to American law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China\u2019s use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties.Analysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups.\u201cPeople tend to forget the global impact of this,\u201d said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. \u201cThe reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It\u2019s even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms.\u201dGovernments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad.Apple\u2019s resistance to the United States government\u2019s demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,\u201d said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide on Tuesday to support Apple. \u201cApple is doing what every company should be doing.\u201dAround the world, people are aware of the impasse but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company\u2019s other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t see why\u201d the company\u2019s standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cwould change my mind about buying a new phone.\u201dIn China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status.Wen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who on Friday was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing\u2019s upscale Sanlitun district, is one of Apple\u2019s millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei.\u201cI\u2019ve never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple\u2019s socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company\u2019s core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders\u2019 meeting, Mr. Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, \u201cthen you should get out of the stock.\u201dBut data privacy may eventually motivate investors \u2014 and ultimately more customers \u2014 to vote with their wallets because \u201cit\u2019s an issue that speaks directly to the business,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u201cRight now people buy phones regardless of encryption issues, but we have to wait and see how bloody this fight gets.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Vegetarian,\u2019 by Han Kang", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLast August, Anne Rice posted a call to arms \u2014 on Facebook, of course \u2014 warning that political correctness was going to bring on literary end times: banned books, destroyed authors, \u201ca new era of censorship.\u201d \u201cWe must stand up for fiction as a place where transgressive behavior and ideas can be explored,\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cI think we have to be willing to stand up for the despised.\u201d I, a fan of transgressive literature, could not pinpoint why I found her post to be so much more vexing than the usual battle cries of P.C.-paranoiacs. I finally had my answer after reading Han Kang\u2019s novel \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d: What if \u201cthe despised\u201d can stand up on their own?All the trigger warnings on earth cannot prepare a reader for the traumas of this Korean author\u2019s translated debut in the Anglophone world. At first, you might eye the title and scan the first innocuous sentence \u2014 \u201cBefore my wife turned vegetarian, I thought of her as completely unremarkable in every way\u201d \u2014 and think that the biggest risk here might be converting to vegetarianism. (I myself converted, again; we\u2019ll see if it lasts.) But there is no end to the horrors that rattle in and out of this ferocious, magnificently death-affirming novel.When Yeong-hye awoke one morning from troubled dreams, she found herself changed into a monstrous .\u2008.\u2008. vegetarian. And that\u2019s where the misleadingly simple echoes of a certain classic premise end. Han\u2019s novella-in-three-parts zigzags between domestic thriller, transformation parable and arborphiliac meditation, told from the points of view of her lousy husband, who works at an office (Part I); her obsessive brother-in-law, who is an artist (Part II); and her overburdened older sister, who manages a cosmetics store (Part III). These three characters are largely defined by what they do for a living, whereas Yeong-hye stops doing much of anything altogether. \u201cI had a dream,\u201d she says in one of her rare moments of direct dialogue, her only explanation of her newfound herbivorism. At first she is met with casual disdain by family and friends; a dinner acquaintance passive-aggressively declares, \u201cI\u2019d hate to share a meal with someone who considers eating meat repulsive, just because that\u2019s how they themselves personally feel .\u2008.\u2008. don\u2019t you agree?\u201d But soon her physical form creates the very negative space those close to her fear: weight loss, insomnia, diminished libido and the eventual abandonment of everyday \u201ccivilized\u201d life.An ascetic tome this is not: The novel is full of sex of dubious consent, all sorts of force-feeding and purging \u2014 essentially sexual assault and eating disorders, but never by name in Han\u2019s universe. A family gathering where Yeong-hye is attacked by her own father over meat-eating \u00adspirals several layers darker into self-harm, though it won\u2019t be the last time a man (or she herself, for that matter) violates her body. Violation of the mind, however, is a different issue. \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d needs all this bloodletting because in its universe, violence is connected with physical sustenance \u2014 in meat-eating, sex-having, even care-taking. Outside intervention, from family and friends and doctors, works to moderate the reality of this story, but their efforts are in the end as anemic as Anne Rice\u2019s rescue of \u201cthe despised.\u201d After all, who is the victim here? You can\u2019t save a soul if it becomes something beyond \u00adsalvation.We get brief italicized sequences that describe Yeong-hye\u2019s thoughts, which range from diarylike internal monologues to something approaching a post-language state. A passage begins: \u201cCan only trust my breasts now. I like my breasts; nothing can be killed by them. Hand, foot, tongue, gaze, all weapons from which nothing is safe,\u201d and then melts into the sudden realization that her old self is disappearing: \u201cWhy am I changing like this? Why are all my edges sharpening \u2014 what am I going to gouge?\u201d At other times the language of devastation needs only the sensory details: a dying bird hidden in a clenched fist, an IV bag half full of blood, painted flowers on a naked body, the unremitting stench of sizzling meat.Originally published in South Korea in 2007 and inspired by the author\u2019s short story \u201cThe Fruit of My Woman,\u201d \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d was the first of Han\u2019s works to be made into a feature film. (A second film, based on another novella, was released in 2011.) She has been rightfully celebrated as a visionary in South Korea and has been published around the world, but it took the enthusiasm of her translator, Deborah Smith, to bring \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d to publishing homes in Britain and the United States. Smith learned Korean only about six years ago, mastering it through the process of translating this book. She inhabits the prose\u2019s terrible serenity and glacial horror \u2014 the translator\u2019s hand never overwhelms or underperforms. Both lithe and sharp, syntax and diction never become mechanical and obtuse the way bad translations often render something \u201cforeign.\u201dFor a danger here would be to focus only on the ethnographic and sociological. In Britain, where \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d landed on The Evening Standard\u2019s best-seller list, reviews tried to make sense of its strangeness by attributing it to the culture. \u201cThe narrative makes it clear it is the crushing pressure of Korean etiquette which murders them,\u201d The Independent daftly concluded. Other British reviewers tried to emphasize that vegetarianism is impossible in South Korea. Likewise, a contemporary Western feminist lens could also yield a condemnation of the novel as an exercise in female debasement or \u201ctorture porn.\u201d But this would again assume a problematic normalcy and measure the book against it. There is an entire world of literature outside the West that is not adapted to our markets, in debt to our trends or in pursuit of our politics.Rather, Han\u2019s glorious treatments of agency, personal choice, submission and subversion find form in the parable. There is something about short literary forms \u2014 this novel is under 200 pages \u2014 in which the allegorical and the violent gain special potency from their small packages. \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d feels related to slender works as diverse as Ceridwen Dovey\u2019s 2007 novella \u201cBlood Kin\u201d and Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby, the Scrivener.\u201d I was also reminded of the Iranian author Sadegh Hedayat\u2019s 1937 cult horror masterpiece, \u201cThe Blind Owl.\u201d (Hedayat himself was a vegetarian, and there are cyclical scenes in his nightmarish landscapes in which the killing of animals is positioned as the root of madness.) Ultimately, though, how could we not go back to Kafka? More than \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d Kafka\u2019s journals and \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d haunt this text. And Kafka is perhaps the most famous vegetarian in literary history; he apparently once declared to a fish in an aquarium, \u201cNow at last I can look at you in peace; I don\u2019t eat you anymore.\u201dStill, Han Kang\u2019s is not some cautionary tale for the omnivorous, as Yeong-hye\u2019s vegetarian journey is far from a happy one. Abstaining from eating living things doesn\u2019t lead to enlightenment. As \u00adYeong-hye fades further and further from the living, our author, like a true god, lets us struggle with the question of whether we should root for our hero to survive or to die. With that question comes another, the ultimate question we never quite want to contemplate. \u201cWhy, is it such a bad thing to die?\u201d Yeong-hye asks at the end of one section. The next section simply echoes back: \u201cWhy, is it such a bad thing to die?\u201dTHE VEGETARIANBy Han KangTranslated by Deborah Smith188 pp. Hogarth. $21.Porochista Khakpour is the author of the novels \u201cSons and Other Flammable Objects\u201d and \u201cThe Last Illusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I can ape the vocabulary of my times but it is not mine. Certain things I cannot say, only mouth.I grew up with readers and, by extension, readership. The readers have vanished like migrating birds. They have been replaced by users and by viewers and by audience. The verbal experience has given way to the visual experience. Where pages were turned images are clicked. Words, those obdurate jewels, have been processed to form content, a commodity like any other. The letter has given way to the link.I do not have the words to be at ease in this world of steep migration from desktop to mobile, of search-engine optimization, of device-agnostic bundles, of cascading metrics and dashboards and buckets, of post-print onboarding and social-media FOMO (fear of missing out).I was more at home with the yarn du jour.Jour was once an apt first syllable for the word journalism; hour would now be more appropriate. The yarn of the day, culled from the local press, was the foreign correspondent\u2019s bread and butter. \u201cYesterday\u2019s news, today\u2019s story!\u201dThat was in the time of distance. Disconnection equaled immersion. Today, connection equals distraction.I read therefore I am. I am \u201cliked\u201d therefore I am. I am of the place I am in. I am of the device I inhabit. Talk to me. Facebook me. These are distinct ways of being. They lead to distinct ways of communicating.We find ourselves at a pivot point. How we exist in relation to one another is in the midst of radical redefinition, from working to flirting. The smartphone is a Faustian device, at once liberation and enslavement. It frees us to be anywhere and everywhere \u2014 and most of all nowhere. It widens horizons. It makes those horizons invisible. Upright homo sapiens, millions of years in the making, has yielded in a decade to the stooped homo sapiens of downward device-dazzled gaze.A smartphone is no longer enough. We must have a smart car and a smart home. Or so we are told. A low-I.Q. home feels good enough to me.Perhaps this is how the calligrapher felt after 1440, when it began to be clear what Gutenberg had wrought. A world is gone. Another, as poor Jeb Bush (!) has discovered, is being born \u2014 one where words mean everything and the contrary of everything, where sentences have lost their weight, where volume drowns truth.You have to respect American voters. They are changing the lexicon in their anger with the status quo. They don\u2019t care about consistency. They care about energy. Reasonableness dies. Provocation works. Whether you are for or against something, or both at the same time, is secondary to the rise your position gets. Our times are unpunctuated. Politics, too, has a new language, spoken above all by the Republican front-runner as he repeats that, \u201cThere is something going on.\u201dYes, there is something going on. The phrase resonates with people who feel they have somehow lost control. Stuck, they seek movement above all.I am not alone in my illiteracy. All around me I see people struggling to understand, anxious they cannot keep up, outpaced by forces they cannot grasp. With knowledge of, and access to, the billions of people sharing the planet has come a new loneliness. How cold and callous is the little screen of our insidious temptation, working our fingers so hard to produce so little!That acronym, FOMO, is used by Nir Eyal, a former game designer, in his book \u201cHooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.\u201d In it he describes the fear-of-missing-out mood that triggers people to turn and return to a successful app: \u201cFeelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.\u201dI nodded my head at this in Jacob Weisberg\u2019s review in The New York Review of Books. In the same review, Weisberg writes, \u201cOnce out of bed, we check our phones 221 times a day \u2014 an average of every 4.3 minutes \u2014 according to a U.K. study.\u201d He also notes that one thing young people don\u2019t do on their smartphones \u201cis actually speak to one another.\u201dThis appears to be some form of addictive delirium. It is probably dangerous in some still unknowable way.But if this is a confession, it is not a lament. Yes, I feel illiterate. Technology has upended not only newspapers. It has upended language itself, which is none other than a community\u2019s system of communication. What is a community today? Can there be community at all with downward gazes? I am not sure. But I am certain that cross-platform content has its beauty and its promise if only I could learn the right words to describe them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Twitter Is Like a Deli With Good Pastrami", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byBitsNow you may ask: Why does it matter that user growth has stalled, when revenue is still going up? To answer that question, let\u2019s use the neighborhood deli metaphor.Consider an ad on Twitter \u2014 that\u2019s how the company makes money, after all, \u2014 to be a tasty pastrami sandwich. Now imagine everyone within five blocks of your deli loves your pastrami sandwiches.But it is impossible to sell sandwiches outside of that five-block neighborhood. At some point, you\u2019re going to run out of customers. Even worse, they\u2019ll probably get tired of your pastrami and start eating something else.That\u2019s what happens when Twitter stops growing. If its users are limited \u2014 like the deli\u2019s neighborhood \u2014 the number of ads it can sell is capped. And once it hits that cap, there is nowhere to go but down.This, not surprisingly, did not go over well in India. By Wednesday morning, Mr. Andreessen, not known as the apologizing sort, posted a round of mea culpa tweets and promised to leave discussions about colonialism to people who know something about it. He apologized again in the afternoon.So Twitter may be slowing down, but you can\u2019t say it isn\u2019t still interesting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "PAC Is Backing Donald Trump, Despite Campaign\u2019s Policy", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "At first glance, the fund-raising email from TrumPAC could confuse a recipient. The solicitation that went out this week from what has been described in news media accounts as a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d meaning it is barred from coordinating with the campaign, urges people to make a contribution of $5 that will \u201cgo straight to Donald Trump \u2014 we\u2019ll eat all the processing costs so he gets 100 percent and YOU will show up on his F.E.C. report!\u201d As it turns out, TrumPAC \u2014 which was founded by a donor with help from a Tea Party activist \u2014 has a classification that allows it to raise both super PAC money and hard-dollar contributions that it can direct to the campaign. What\u2019s unclear is exactly how Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, which has denounced super PACs and has sent letters to others using his name asking them to shut down, feels about it. The TrumPAC solicitation was signed by the group\u2019s chairwoman, Amy Kremer, the former chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, and sought low-dollar donations of $5 to $50. \u201cWe are witnessing a Revolution!\u201d she wrote. On its own, the solicitation seemed strange, given that super PAC money can\u2019t go directly to a campaign.Dan Backer, an election lawyer working with TrumPAC, explained that the group is a \u201chybrid,\u201d meaning there are two separate bank accounts: one that directs regulated donations to the campaign, and another that collects money for a super PAC, which can raise unlimited funds. He said that several hundred dollars had already been given to the campaign. He declined to say what kind of interactions the group might have had with the campaign in terms of directing donations to them. All of this gets somewhat confusing, since Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t want super PAC support and has made turning down large donations a staple of his candidacy. He often says he is funding his own campaign, a statement that is true to a point \u2014 he has loaned his campaign $12 million but has also raised millions in small donations. Last year, it emerged that a super PAC using the same name as his campaign slogan \u2014 Make America Great Again \u2014 had ties to officials on his campaign. The person running that group, a  Republican operative from Colorado named Mike Ciletti, has a company that has been used by the campaign over the last year for things like bumper stickers. When questions were raised about overlap between the two groups, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign urged that group and a crop of other super PACs hoping to support him to shut down. Mr. Ciletti complied. Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman did not respond to an email asking about TrumPAC, which is being supported in part by William Doddridge, the chief executive of the Jewelry Exchange. But on Friday afternoon, Mr. Backer said in an email that Ms. Kremer had authorized him to say \u201cthat the campaigns\u2019 counsel reached out, my client appreciates the campaign doing so and their respect for the constitutional right of individuals to organize and engage in political speech and grass-roots activism, and my client is very quickly assessing its next steps out of respect for their concerns.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "HomeAway, a Home Rental Service, Mocks the Competition", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingWith \u201cIt\u2019s Your Vacation, Why Share It?\u201d as its tag line, a new advertising campaign by the online home-rental service HomeAway depicts some of the many awkward, gross or annoying ways this kind of shared-lodging arrangement can go wrong.The name of HomeAway\u2019s chief rival, Airbnb, is never mentioned, but the implication is clear.Airbnb, in addition to aiding the rental of vacant homes or apartments, also gives hosts and guests the option of renting or staying in a home \u2014 in a spare room, for instance \u2014 with the homeowner present. With HomeAway, renters get the place to themselves.\u201cDefinitely, we\u2019re using a different kind of tone,\u201d said HomeAway\u2019s chief marketing officer, Mariano Dima. \u201cWe want to continue with the same positioning, but it was very important to us to be clear how we\u2019re different.\u201dAirbnb declined to comment.The campaign, developed with Saatchi & Saatchi in London, includes broadcast and digital videos, with a voice-over by the actor Nick Offerman of \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d fame.It also takes a swipe at hotels, depicting a family having lunch poolside caught in the crossfire of a water-gun fight and a woman trying to relax on a chaise longue while a wild-haired fellow guest plays air guitar and loudly jams to the music playing in his earbuds.\u201cI think the idea of not sharing your holiday is a simple kind of thing,\u201d said Kate Stanners, the chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi.\u201cIt\u2019s louder. It\u2019s funny rather than emotional,\u201d Ms. Stanners said of the new campaign, acknowledging that it takes a more pointed approach to distinguishing HomeAway from its competitors. \u201cOur competition would be Airbnb, and it\u2019s also hotels, so we almost wanted to start behaving almost like a challenger of the challenger.\u201dThe private rental segment of the lodging industry is growing quickly, analysts say, raising the stakes as companies jockey for market share.\u201cThe surveys show them in single digits as far as penetration, but they\u2019re catching up fast,\u201d said Chekitan Dev, a professor who teaches marketing and branding at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration (and who owns a vacation home that he sometimes lists on HomeAway).Airbnb has two million listings worldwide, according to its website, compared with HomeAway\u2019s one million-plus. Several smaller companies around the world also compete in this market. In a November research note, Morningstar analysts estimated that HomeAway had about 40 percent of the online vacation rental bookings market.\u201cWhat used to be called the alternative accommodations category is coming into its own,\u201d Mr. Dev said. \u201cThe \u2018other\u2019 category is becoming more mainstream. It\u2019s becoming more competitive.\u201dLast year, the online travel behemoth Expedia, which previously acquired competitors like Orbitz and Travelocity, paid nearly $4 billion for HomeAway. The purchase was completed in December.Now that HomeAway has big corporate backing, expectations are high. \u201cExpedia\u2019s technology, marketing and conversion expertise should be able to leverage HomeAway\u2019s leading share of online vacation rental bookings,\u201d Morningstar analysts said.With this in mind, \u201cit\u2019s important for HomeAway to elevate consumer awareness that they exist,\u201d Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst, said. The timing is good, he said, because people are probably thinking about booking vacations for spring break and for summer.\u201cThe level of awareness of the category is still low,\u201d Mr. Dima said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of space for growth.\u201d He declined to specify how much the campaign cost, although he said it was in the tens of millions of dollars and was the biggest marketing investment in the company\u2019s 10-year history.Aside from 15- and 30-second television ads, and a 60-second version online, the campaign is being promoted through email and social media initiatives, including a Facebook contest last month that generated more than 1,400 comments.\u201cThe majority of our investment has gone digitally,\u201d Mr. Dima said. Since the HomeAway app was upgraded last year, more people have been using it to navigate and book stays, he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re an e-commerce business \u2014 55 percent of our traffic comes from mobile.\u201dAlthough a strategy of knocking the competition has its limits, analysts said, the edgier creative content HomeAway has embraced could succeed at introducing more people to the brand.Mr. Dima said depicting moments like the \u201chairy soap\u201d encounter was worth the risk because of the buzz it generates. Ms. Stanners concurred.\u201cWhat we\u2019ll be doing over the coming weeks is use of more social media platforms, then slightly more tactical stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that it hits a nerve.\u201dAn article on Monday about a new advertising campaign for the Airbnb rival HomeAway, using information from a HomeAway executive, referred incorrectly to its mobile business. It receives 55 percent of its traffic \u2014 not profit \u2014 from mobile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Artificial Intelligence Beats Expert at Go Game", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "But about 10 years ago, everything changed. Go software started incorporating Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The idea here is to play out hundreds of thousands of random games from the current position all the way to the end, and accumulate statistics on wins and losses. It sounds crazy, but if you put the statistics together the right way, this actually works.That began the modern era of computer Go. (I guess with deep learning we are now in postmodern era?)

Can you develop a strategy that wins consistently?Machine-learning definitely isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t required for programming an AI to play Say 16, but if you\u2019re game for it, try altering the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules or design your own game from scratch.

He worked on a shoestring, living with the migrants and at times going without meals.The winning image has not been published before, Mr. Richardson said, although he had sent it, along with others from the European migrant crisis, to two photo agencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a tough industry to be in, tough financially and on your personal life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Richardson has worked internationally on substantive issues for more than 20 years but said he has had to, at times, turn to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccelebrity-based\u00e2\u0080\u009d photography to finance more serious stories.But the paparazzi stakeouts eventually became too discordant with his other work and he had to stop, he said.Other 2016 winners included several photographers working for The New York Times. In total The Times received three first place awards.Mauricio Lima took first place for an image of an Islamic State fighter being treated at a Kurdish hospital. Tara Todras-Whitehall was awarded third place for Sport stories for her photos of a soccer club of ebola survivors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese awards demonstrate the serious commitment to quality photojournalism and telling difficult stories while working in hard situations of Sergey, Daniel, Mauricio, and Tara,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michele McNally, the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 director of photography.  Winners from past contests have included Mads Nissen, John Stanmeyer, Paul Hansen, Samuel Aranda and Jodi Bieber.In addition, two photo essays, each published in several installments on the Lens blog, won first and second place in the long-term projects category for a single photographer.Mary Calvert won first place for her searing photographs of survivors of sexual abuse in the United States military. Nancy Borowick took second place for her intimate photo essay of her parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 love as they both succumbed to cancer. David Guttenfelder came in third in the category for his photographs of North Korea.  No winners were announced in the group long-term projects category.After last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversies, the World Press consulted with photographers, editors and publishers in 15 countries to produce new rules. The changes included a code of ethics for entrants and provided detailed guidelines regarding digital manipulation of images.The Amsterdam-based organization also added an independent fact-checking process for captions and a 36-hour period for entrants whose images may have been unduly altered to explain their process.Lars Boering, the managing director of World Press Photo, said in an interview that the new rules were successfully instituted.The process \u00e2\u0080\u009cran smoothly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that the judging process was not much different from in previous years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe winning image is in line with the changes of World Press photos over the last few years to being more interpretive and poetic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he was speaking just for himself.All of the winning photos were checked for caption accuracy and postprocessing violations, he said. Information on any disqualifications of images that were considered as finalists will not be released until a technical report on the contest is issued on Feb. 29. But Mr. Boering said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe checked more photos than last year and found less, and that\u2019s clearly a good sign.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlong with Mr. Boering, David Campbell spent much of the last year shepherding the re-examination of the contest.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe process clarified the purpose of the contest as one based on journalistic ethics where the pictures have to be accurate and fair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe renewed focus for the contest and the verification processes worked, and the outcome was very satisfying from the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jury is independent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.UpdateTwo Syrian freelance photographers working with Agence France-Presse covering their country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict won awards in the World Press Photo contest. A photographer working under the name Sameer al-Douma received first place in the spot news stories category. The name Abd Doumany appeared with an entry that took second place for general news stories. Both name are pseudonyms.When asked about the use of the names last week, Francis Kohn, AFP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo director, confirmed that both names were pseudonyms. He said local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought it was fine for these guys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use \u00e2\u0080\u0098stringer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which we do sometimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lars Boering, the executive director of World Press Photo, said that Mr. Kohn, who was jury chairman for the contest, told him of the pseudonyms after the judging but before the results were announced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re very happy that guys like that get awards working in areas like Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also realize how dangerous it is to be exposed and this is why we awarded them under their working names.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real name if they might be in danger. The Times has previously published AFP photos using the credits Abd Doumany and Sameer Al-Doumy, both online and in print, without knowing they were pseudonyms."}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Bloomberg bemoaned a lack of solutions from the  2016 presidential candidates on Thursday night, the most explicit rationale he has offered for why he is considering a third-party campaign of his own.\u201cThis really has been a race to the extremes,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, said in remarks at his philanthropic foundation on the Upper East Side, as he introduced the veteran Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan at a celebration of the release of her new book.Ms. Noonan, Mr. Bloomberg said, has explained that the current candidates \u201csense that America has lost faith with its institutions.\u201dBut \u201cinstead of trying to fix it,\u201d he added, the candidates are \u201ctrying to exploit it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cThe list of supposed villains we hear about is long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bloomberg said, but the solutions are \u201cin short supply.\u201dThe most pressing problems in the country, he said, were \u201cwage stagnation at home, American retreat around the world\u201d and a \u201ccorrupt gridlock and two-party system that answers to lobbyists and special interests instead of the American people.\u201d These issues created an opening for the success that outsider candidates are seeing so far in the race, he said.\u201cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you see the kind of candidates out there doing well,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cAnd not the conventional ones.\u201dHe didn\u2019t mention his own explorations directly. He also didn\u2019t mention either Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Donald J. Trump by name, but his remarks were a clear reference to each.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve problems by pointing fingers, or making pie-in-the-sky promises,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bloomberg said, saying that fixes come from \u201cbringing people together around common goals, promoting innovation, demonstrating independence, and recognizing that compromise is not a bad word.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments were his most explicit expression of frustration with the state of the 2016 presidential race, and they came less than two weeks before his self-imposed deadline for a decision on an independent campaign.For months, Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top advisers have quietly explored the prospect of a bid for the White House, and he has indicated he would be willing to spend $1 billion of his own fortune on the race, should he conclude that there is a path to victory.So far, the 2016 primaries have been inviting for an independent politician who would run as a business-minded technocrat. The early success of Mr. Trump on the Republican side, and Mr. Sanders on the Democratic side, would seem to leave a vacant lane in the political center.Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advisers said he was taking a new and intensive round of political polling after the New Hampshire primary this month, to gauge his chances in a national election.Political leaders in both parties remain skeptical that Mr. Bloomberg will enter the race, or that if he did, he would be able to win the 270 votes in the Electoral College required to capture the presidency.But Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential adversaries have eyed his preparations warily. At a recent briefing hosted by advisers to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the conservative billionaire brothers, Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible campaign was the subject of a slide in a presentation on the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the presentation, who discussed it on the condition of anonymity because the session was intended to be confidential.Mr. Bloomberg was depicted in the briefing as a big-government politician who had wielded his power too freely. In an allusion to Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt as mayor to ban large sodas, the slide on his 2016 plans was illustrated with an image of a Big Gulp.James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a group backed by the Kochs, confirmed that Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record had been reviewed as part of a presentation on the 2016 field. Mr. Davis said Mr. Bloomberg was seen as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnanny state mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had taken positions on issues like health care and gun control that were at odds with small-government conservatism.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a litany of things in his record where he takes the position that government should control more decisions for Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Davis said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just vastly different from where we stand on the issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have said they would welcome the contrast with Mr. Bloomberg as an opponent in the race.Hillary Clinton said in a television interview that she believed Mr. Bloomberg would run only if Mr. Sanders were the Democratic nominee.Because of the deadlines an independent candidate must meet in order to get his name on all 50 state ballots, Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advisers believe he must make a final decision by early March.That means he may have to make up his mind based in large part on the results of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 1, when large states like Texas and Virginia go to the polls.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The senator also criticized Mrs. Clinton on several fronts: her praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, her ties to Wall Street and her stances on trade policies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe truth is, tomorrow is important and key,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said, adding, as usual, that a high voter turnout would benefit him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can win, no question, here in Minnesota \u2014 if we have the turnout.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders also said it was important that voters understood the differences between him and Mrs. Clinton. He stressed that he did not have a \u201csuper PAC\u201d as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.The senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe owe Native Americans so, so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community. That will change under a Sanders administration.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis address came after his campaign announced that the senator had raised $36 million  from 1.2 million individual donors in February. The campaign added that they hoped to raise $40 million by the end of Monday \u2014 meaning that they are aiming to bring in $4 million in one day.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

She also implied that Mr. Sanders had better foreign policy judgment than his rival.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a commander in chief who has foresight, who exercises good judgment, and who understands the need for a robust foreign policy which defends the safety and security of the American people, and who will not waste precious lives and money on interventionist wars of regime change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gabbard said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can elect a president who will lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change, or we can elect a president who will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt the time, the party\u2019s leadership had been criticized for allowing only a limited number of debates, which some viewed as an effort to deny Mr. Sanders more time to confront Mrs. Clinton when she was ahead in polls.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Campaign Spread False Report in Iowa That Ben Carson Was Quitting Race", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "As Iowa Republicans headed to the caucuses on Monday night, Senator Ted Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign left recorded messages for supporters with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreaking news\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Ben Carson would drop out of the race, and told them to \u00e2\u0080\u009cinform any Carson caucus-goers of this news and urge them to caucus for Ted instead.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe false report, echoed in an email and in a text message sent to campaign volunteers, was trumpeted by at least some Cruz precinct captains when they addressed their caucuses. When Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, Candy Carson, arrived at two precincts to speak on his behalf, she was furious to learn that speakers for Mr. Cruz had suggested moments earlier that her husband was quitting the race.The Cruz campaign on Friday acknowledged it had made a coordinated effort to spread the story. But it defended its actions as an honest mistake based on \u00e2\u0080\u009creports,\u00e2\u0080\u009d namely CNN anchors echoing Twitter messages from a reporter saying that Mr. Carson was heading home to Florida after Iowa, rather than to New Hampshire or South Carolina, where the next contests were to be held. However, those messages were followed almost instantly by another from one of the reporters stating that Mr. Carson would remain in the race \u00e2\u0080\u009cno matter what.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A senior strategist for Mr. Carson, Jason Osborne, had reiterated on Twitter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot standing down.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Carson campaign, which has angrily accused Mr. Cruz of dirty tricks, escalated the feud on Friday by using the audio recording of the message left by Cruz supporters in a fund-raising email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the call began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the Cruz campaign with breaking news: Dr. Ben Carson will be suspending campaigning following tonight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz, who won the Republican caucuses, apologized to Mr. Carson this week. At a news conference in Washington, Mr. Carson said that Mr. Cruz had not gone far enough in addressing the situation and called on him to fire the staff members who spread the false rumors.Mr. Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth-place showing in Iowa, where he got 9.3 percent of the vote, was equal to or slightly better than his support in polls before the caucuses, raising doubts about whether the Cruz disinformation swayed many voters. Nonetheless, the issue has become a distraction to Mr. Carson ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and it has raised questions about the tactics of the Cruz campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really demoralizing. People are angry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Osborne said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day, as more information comes out, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting more animated about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, referring to Mr. Carson.Since Mr. Carson rose to the top of Iowa polls last year, his campaign has faced major upheavals. This week he shed staff members to cut costs. He had refrained from attacking his rivals throughout the campaign, but he has latched on to the Cruz tactics to garner attention and, now, to raise money.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz defended the voice mail messages, saying they were not deceptive because they had said Mr. Carson was \u00e2\u0080\u009csuspending campaigning\u00e2\u0080\u009d by not going directly to New Hampshire from Iowa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur campaign shared an accurate report that Carson was suspending campaigning after the caucuses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he went home and he went to D.C. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and these voice mails do not suggest that he would completely drop out of the race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier.While perhaps narrowly correct, it is largely understood that suspending a campaign means a candidate is quitting. That was how Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who endorsed Mr. Cruz, interpreted the report in a Twitter message he posted about 20 minutes after the caucuses began on Monday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSkipping NH & SC the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to all caucus goers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA minute later, Mr. King added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarson looks like he is out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Carson campaign prepared a timeline for its internal use showing that the episode began at 6:43 p.m. in Iowa when a CNN reporter, Chris Moody, said on Twitter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarson won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to NH/SC, but instead will head home to Florida for some R&R.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMoments later Mr. Moody tweeted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign tells me he plans to stay in the race beyond Iowa no matter what the results are tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCNN anchors on a live broadcast almost simultaneously repeated Mr. Moody\u2019s tweet that Mr. Carson was taking a break from the campaign trail, but not the campaign\u2019s assertion he was not dropping out.    Ten minutes later, Mr. Osborne, who was traveling with Mr. Carson, clarified in a tweet that the candidate \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be going to Florida to get fresh clothes b4 heading out on the campaign trail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

For days, they replied to his posts with demeaning, often sexually charged insults aimed at Ms. Jacobus, including several with altered, vulgar photographs of her face.With his enormous online platform, Mr. Trump has badgered and humiliated those who have dared to cross him during the presidential race. He has latched onto their vulnerabilities, mocking their physical characteristics, personality quirks and, sometimes, their professional setbacks. He has made statements, like his claims about Ms. Jacobus, that have later been exposed as false or deceptive \u2014 only after they have ricocheted across the Internet.A detailed list of the journalists, politicians and places President Trump has insulted since declaring his candidacy.Many recipients of Mr. Trump\u2019s hectoring are fellow politicians, with paid staff members to help them defend themselves. But for others, the experience of being targeted by Mr. Trump is nightmarish and a form of public degradation that they believe is intended to scare off adversaries by making an example of them.It is not just that Mr. Trump has a skill for zeroing in on an individual\u2019s soft spot and hammering at it. It is that he sets a tone of aggression against the person, and his supporters echo and amplify it.\u201cOver and over and over again: You were rejected by him, you\u2019re a scorned woman,\u201d Ms. Jacobus said, paraphrasing the hundreds of online attacks she faced.Ms. Jacobus sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Trump and his top aide, citing electronic messages that showed the Trump campaign had courted her and not the other way around.\u201cI have been trashed and ruined on Twitter,\u201d Ms. Jacobus said. She said that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers had responded to her letter, but that they had not yet reached a resolution.Even when Mr. Trump moves on to something or someone else on Twitter, his followers linger on the last fight.Mr. Lowry, who devoted an issue of his magazine to critiquing Mr. Trump and has welcomed the candidate\u2019s scorn, said he received a flood of hostile Twitter attacks from Mr. Trump\u2019s followers after the issue was published. Their posts, he said, regularly include \u201csome really vile, neo-Nazi-issue white nationalist, heinous personal abuse, kind of racially tinged stuff.\u201dAs Mr. Trump has risen in the Republican race, he has only dialed up his tactics. This week, he sent out a menacing message on Twitter about the Ricketts family, a wealthy clan of Republican political donors, after it was reported that Marlene Ricketts donated $3 million to a group opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201cIt\u2019s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom,\u201d Marlene Ricketts\u2019s son, Tom, later told reporters.In particular, she said his methods were characteristic of \u201cmean-girl cyberbullying\u201d because he enlists others to mimic his attacks. She said his conduct resembled the violent and abusive language her organization can often get removed from Facebook and Twitter.\u201cAt what point does it cross the line into something that\u2019s defamatory and might be actionable?\u201d Ms. Aftab said. \u201cAt what point does it cross the line into encouraging violence against groups and individuals?\u201dIn Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Trump savaged local power brokers who had endorsed other candidates and criticized his campaign. He called Joseph W. McQuaid, the publisher of The New Hampshire Union Leader, a \u201cpsycho\u201d and a \u201cdirty dog,\u201d and he accused him of trying to force Mr. Trump to advertise in his newspaper before it endorsed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. McQuaid, who has roundly denied Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, said he still gets occasional Twitter messages and letters from readers about his clash with Mr. Trump, weeks after the Feb. 9 primary. \u201cI think his goal,\u201d Mr. McQuaid said, \u201cis to shut down opposition.\u201dCorey Lewandowski, the Trump campaign manager, said his candidate\u2019s practice of battering opponents on social media showed that Mr. Trump was \u201cthe ultimate counterpuncher,\u201d a tough candidate unwilling to take even the slightest criticism lightly.\u201cWhen someone attacks him, should he just not respond?\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201dMr. Lewandowski said he was unaware of a cease-and-desist letter from Ms. Jacobus, and he described the Trump fans who follow the candidate\u2019s lead as people who \u201ctrust Donald Trump to, when he has to, take action\u201d against those who wish him ill.If Mr. Trump\u2019s merciless methods have seemed to help him so far, there could be a political down side over the long run. His attacks have opened wounds in the Republican ranks that are unlikely to heal anytime soon. Several people he has targeted have said they would have difficulty supporting him in a general election.Bob Vander Plaats, an influential evangelical activist in Iowa, said it might be impossible for him to vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump wooed Mr. Vander Plaats for his endorsement early on and turned on him bitterly after Mr. Vander Plaats instead backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.In late January, Mr. Vander Plaats recalled, he was about to go on television when his phone beeped, as it does whenever his Twitter handle is mentioned. This time, the mention was by @realDonaldTrump, who accused Mr. Vander Plaats of seeking free hotel stays for his family in exchange for his endorsement of Mr. Trump.

{"Headline": "Rush Limbaugh Sees Strategy Behind Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018They Lied\u2019 Claim", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "As Donald J. Trump on Monday avoided repeating his recent debate claim that the George W. Bush administration had \u201clied\u201d in the buildup to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said that Mr. Trump had used the language of Democrats to attack the former president. On his radio show on Monday afternoon, Mr. Limbaugh theorized that Mr. Trump might be deploying a strategy to turn out Democrats and independents in a state with an open primary. \u201cThe things that Trump said and did Saturday night came out of nowhere,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make any sense. Here we are in a Republican primary, and Donald Trump, out of the blue, starts blaming the Bush family for 9/11, for knowing that the intelligence was made up, that there never were any weapons of mass destruction, and they knew it, Trump said.\u201d Mr. Trump, in a news conference on Monday, stood by his comments about the World Trade Center falling down during Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency. But he pointedly declined to repeat his debate remark that \u201cthey lied,\u201d and he said he was unwilling to assign blame to Mr. Bush. Mr. Limbaugh added: \u201cMichael Moore doesn\u2019t even say that. The World Trade Center came down when George W. Bush was president so don\u2019t anybody tell me, Trump said, he kept us safe. He jumped all over the Bush family and the Iraq war and claimed that he was on record way, way back as always being opposed to the Iraq war, that it was going to muddy up the Middle East and cause a quagmire. \u201d But \u201cnobody can find any record of Trump having opposed the Iraq war in 2001, 2002,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. He also raised questions about Mr. Trump defending the work of Planned Parenthood on everything other than abortion. \u201cFolks, there were a number of occasions where Donald Trump sounded like the Daily Kos blog, where Donald Trump sounded like the Democrat Underground, sounded like any average host on MSNBC,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cPeople think that Mr. Trump was out of control, that he had emotional incontinence that night,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cMaybe, but I still think there was a strategy going into this.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s team, at the beginning of the race, had planned to target Democrats in South Carolina, which has a number of New York City transplants and an open primary system. But denouncing a former president who remains popular in the state in such visceral terms as \u201cthey lied\u201d went further than any Republican ever has, and further than the Democratic presidential nominees in the last three elections, and risks a backlash among the Republican Party\u2019s base just days before the primary.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "At Republican Debate, Donald Trump Falls Into the Line of Fire", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Well, that escalated slowly. In the 10th Republican debate on Thursday, Donald J. Trump came under the heaviest, most sustained fire he has received so far in the campaign. In previous debates, he was often barely acknowledged by his rivals. The questions most political observers had afterward on Thursday: What took everyone so long, and is it too late to matter?For the first part of Thursday\u2019s debate, held at the University of Houston and broadcast by CNN and Telemundo, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas mostly turned their swords away from each other and swung them at Mr. Trump. It was like watching opposition research books turn, page by page, as they hit Mr. Trump over the lawsuit he is facing related to Trump University, his hiring of foreign workers on guest visas for a Florida property, his donations to the Clinton Foundation, and his comments about wanting to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cneutral\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  He offered scant details on policy, but struck back with brutal force against Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, hitting Mr. Rubio for his credit-card debt and calling Mr. Cruz a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasket case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and interrupting each repeatedly. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio maintained his sunny, optimistic case aimed at the Midwestern states voting in March, and Ben Carson mostly complained about his speaking time.Mr. Trump also offered a new explanation for why he has delayed releasing his tax returns and why he has refused to give a date as to when he will: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being audited, he said, and is audited every year, and he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release the taxes until they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re done. He did not explain why he was being audited personally for his company, and said in post-debate interviews on CNN that he believes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being targeted by the I.R.S. because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ca strong Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All of this is fodder that Democrats will resurrect in a general election. Both Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz got under Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin at various points, scoring strong lines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pressing frequently on the question of whether Mr. Trump is the business success he claims to be. But Mr. Trump scored some of his own. In a CNN interview after the debate, Mr. Cruz for the first time said that both he and Mr. Rubio would be better nominees than Mr. Trump, a surprising turn. But it is unclear if this will do anything to stop Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s march toward a large delegate lead. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Sensible Ban on Gun Ads", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn recent years, Facebook has become a thriving marketplace where people buy and sell all kinds of goods and services, including firearms. People often post ads to buy or sell guns on the site and meet in person to complete the transaction. But unlike licensed dealers, private sellers are not required to conduct criminal background checks in most states, and Congress has refused to close this gaping loophole at the federal level.The company has previously banned people from selling prescription drugs on the site, and in 2014 started blocking children\u2019s access to pages advertising guns for sale. It also would send a message to people who posted gun ads to follow the law in their state and country. But those steps did little to stem the trafficking of guns on Facebook. Its new policy to ban all private sales is much more significant. Because its users post so many photos, ads, and other information on its site and Instagram, the company will struggle to weed out all private gun ads. The company will have to rely on its 1.6 billion users to report gun ads to the company. Facebook employees will then have to remove the prohibited ads and pages. In some cases, Facebook might even have to bar some users from its sites if they persist in posting forbidden ads.Of course, Facebook, as big and important as it is, is just one company. There are still many ways for criminals and violent individuals to acquire guns. Only action by Congress can do something about that.Advertisement"}

Their records \u00e2\u0080\u009chardly\u00e2\u0080\u009d make them part of the political establishment, Mr. Clinton said, as he noted they were both supporting Mrs. Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt bothers me to be in an election where a debate is impossible because if you disagree, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just part of the establishment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.He also noted that former Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is campaigning in New Hampshire on Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf, lost his re-election race in 2014 in part because some voters were angry that he had voted for the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Sanders wants to replace the health care law with his Medicare-for-all plan, a legislative goal that, Mrs. Clinton argues, could destabilize the Affordable Care Act and give Republicans a way to repeal it and then block Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea.

Powell and who has speculated that Israel might have carried out chemical attacks in Syria. Mr. Wilkerson, a former Army colonel who has become an ardent critic of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, speculated about Israel\u2019s possible role in a May 2013 interview with Cenk Uygur of Current TV. \u201cThis could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been an Israeli false-flag operation, it could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been an opposition in Syria,\u201d he added, saying that the attacks also could have been carried out by Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president.

For Mr. Goler, the trip led \u201cto the reversal of my previous notion that marriage was a contrived staple of human relations,\u201d and a realization that they could plan the ceremony how they chose.Ms. Reiches saw the possibility of turning a wedding into a fund-raiser for New Life Orphanage\u2019s new school. \u201cFor me, what was important was giving back to a community that had helped to raise me: Ghana,\u201d Ms. Reiches said. \u201cFor us, the pomp and circumstance takes away from what marriage is about: love, support, empowerment, respect and open communication.\u201dPaula Reiches, the bride\u2019s mother, said Mr. Goler connected with her daughter and her passions. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked Zoe to conform in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe says she doesn\u2019t have a stop sign, and he understands that she\u2019s passionate about things. Nobody else has understood the importance of Ghana to her.\u201dLynda Goler, the groom\u2019s mother, recognized the ease in their relationship early on as well. \u201cThe first time Zoe came at the holidays, she got down on the floor with all the kids. She wowed them by disappearing a straw up her nose.\u201dOn Jan. 17, the couple was married in an untraditional wedding at Central Rock Gym in Watertown, Mass. Meredith Reiches, who received a one-day designation from Massachusetts, officiated.Black, white and silver balloons, which were tied to ropes and climbing-route handholds, gently bobbed as the couple stood at the base of the artificial cliff they have often climbed.

If he does not come back like this, we think, how can we change the leader? How can we win?\u201dThe question is a riddle in Cambodia, which has been stuck in roughly the same political cycle for decades.Mr. Sam Rainsy is now as well known for fleeing the country in the face of legal threats as he is for his reform-minded agenda. His retreat to France was his third in a decade.For many Cambodians, the 2013 election was the biggest opportunity yet to break out of that rut. Youth like Ms. Thy Sovantha were a central part of that hope, as a demographic shift gave them a larger say than ever before.Politically, they are restless, having outgrown the authoritarian style and patronage system of Mr. Hun Sen.But having come so close to ousting him and failed, many are disillusioned. And now some are starting to give up on Mr. Sam Rainsy as well.\u201cI feel disappointed and hopeless,\u201d said Ms. Thy Sovantha, now 20.His decision not to return to Cambodia, analysts say, was a lost opportunity, if not a surprise.But even his supporters were disappointed.Ou Ritthy, 28, the founder of a youth political discussion group, said he and his peers were exasperated with the cat-and-mouse game of Cambodian politics.\u201cHun Sen, many things he has been doing are for power, for party interests, and Sam Rainsy also does the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s old-style politics in a new society.\u201dMr. Ou Ritthy credits the sharp rise in Internet penetration and smartphone use for changing the dynamic here.\u201cYouth have two things,\u201d he said. \u201cInformation \u2014 they got informed from social media \u2014 and smartphones.

He has made several policy changes based on complaints posted to his personal page, and last week, he announced the creation of dozens of \u201cFacebook working groups\u201d to gather information about citizens\u2019 concerns.Sun Heng, a 22-year-old university student, said he and most of his friends followed both leaders on Facebook but were still skeptical about the sexagenarians\u2019 embrace of social media.\u201cFor me, I find it very pretentious: Sometimes it is so obvious that they are acting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can also be a good sign, showing that they care what people think now.\u201d\u201cThis is for me the fourth time that I am forced into exile,\u201d he said by Skype from his home in Paris. \u201cBut eventually, each time, the situation changes, and I always manage to be back in time.\u201dThe question for Cambodia is whether his followers will still be waiting. Ms. Thy Sovantha seems to have moved on.She has told her followers, who now number 1.2 million, of her disillusionment with Mr. Sam Rainsy. Her Facebook posts focus increasingly on education and environmental issues rather than party politics, and she is channeling her energy into starting a center for homeless youth.But she may not have entirely given up on the system.

{"Headline": "Mitt Romney Says Donald Trump Should Release His Tax Data", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, raised serious questions about the party\u2019s apparent front-runner for the nomination this year, suggesting that there was most likely something unseemly in Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns and that perhaps the Manhattan businessman was not as rich as he likes to let on.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly, I think we have good reason to believe that there\u2019s a bombshell in Donald Trump\u2019s taxes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Romney said in an interview with Fox News.Asked what he meant, Mr. Romney shared some theories: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither he\u2019s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn\u2019t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasn\u2019t been giving money to the vets or to the disabled like he\u2019s been telling us he\u2019s been doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe remarks from Mr. Romney come as mainstream Republicans have grown increasingly nervous that Mr. Trump will be the party\u2019s nominee. Mr. Romney expressed little hope that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas could break through at this point.\u201cDonald Trump has the clearest path to become the Republican nominee,\u201d Mr. Romney said in some of his most expansive public comments on the state of the campaign. \u201cI think for the other people still in the race, their path is becoming a slimmer and slimmer opening, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having a difficult time communicating to their supporters just how they could become the nominee.\u201dMr. Romney said that he was not singling out Mr. Trump per se, and that he thought all of the candidates should release their tax information before Republican voters pick a nominee.Firing back on Twitter, Mr. Trump said that he did not intend to take political advice from Mr. Romney.Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guyMr. Romney, who is a multimillionaire, released his tax returns in early 2012 after coming under pressure from Democrats. By calling on Mr. Trump to do the same, Mr. Romney, a two-time presidential candidate, is, in a way, taking a page out of the playbook of Senator Harry Reid, who had accused Mr. Romney of not paying taxes for years.Mr. Trump has said publicly that he will release his tax information in the coming months and that the delay has been due to the complexity of his finances. He claims to be worth $10 billion and has said that he pays as little taxes as possible because he loathes how the government spends his money.Having heard such excuses before, Mr. Romney said that even returns from previous years would be helpful.\u201cThe reason I think there is a bombshell in there is because every time he is asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays and says, \u2018Well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on it,'\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cHey, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. We are talking about taxes already filed, back taxes.\u201dWhen the information is eventually released, Mr. Romney will be eager to see what Mr. Trump is hiding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly, the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Romney has come under some pressure from allies of Mr. Rubio to endorse him, in the hopes of demonstrating a show of force that could compel Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to leave the race. But Mr. Romney has told allies that he isn\u2019t ready yet to make an endorsement. However, he has been incensed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, according to people familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing private conversations. The question of unreleased tax returns dogged Mr. Romney throughout the 2012 race. When he finally released them that September, he was hammered for having paid an effective tax rate of less than 15 percent. Some Republican pundits have publicly told Mr. Trump that he was taking a risk waiting to release his returns. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Fail to Meet Deadline for Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byAmerican and European officials failed on Sunday to reach an agreement over how digital data \u2014 including financial information and social media posts \u2014 could be transferred between the two regions. Despite last-minute talks, the two sides remained far apart on specific details required to approve a comprehensive deal. Without an agreement, companies that regularly move data, including tech giants like Google and nontech companies like General Electric, could find themselves in murky legal waters.European and American officials had until Sunday evening to meet a deadline set by Europe\u2019s national privacy agencies, some of which have promised aggressive legal action if the current negotiations founder. Those agencies will publish their own judgment on how data can be moved safely between the two regions on Wednesday.With time ticking down, the two sides are now hoping to agree to a broad deal before European national regulators act on Wednesday, according to several officials with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Still, negotiators said sticking points remained \u2014 including over how Europeans\u2019 data would be protected from surveillance by the American government and how Europeans could seek legal remedies in American courts \u2014 and neither side could guarantee the final outcome.The rules governing the transfer of online data have become a vital issue for many businesses. Facebook and Google, for example, use the information to help tailor the advertisements that are central to their businesses. Many nontech companies, like G.E., move data related to their customers and employees, as well as on how their products are used.No big American company is expected to change how it does business immediately. But many have gathered teams of lawyers to protect themselves in case no deal emerges.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of the Linklaters law firm, who represents companies that may become tangled up in the standoff. \u201cWe need a solution. Global business relies on transferring data. You cannot stop that.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.With the talks increasingly stalled, Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, was expected to call Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, on Sunday in the hopes of brokering a deal.European and American negotiators had been talking for years about a new deal, but the court\u2019s decision \u2014 which went into effect immediately \u2014 made action increasingly urgent.In recent weeks, American officials have offered a number of concessions to their European counterparts. They include increased oversight over American intelligence agencies\u2019 access to European data, according to several officials involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.American officials have also proposed the creation of a so-called data ombudsman within the State Department. That office, according to officials, would give Europeans a direct point of contact in the United States if they believed government agencies had misused their data. Europeans also may seek arbitration directly with American companies that they accuse of unlawfully using their digital information.European officials, though, have expressed doubts that those moves would hold up if challenged in European courts. They have asked the Americans to provide specific details about how the current proposals would work in practice, according to two officials. In particular, Europeans want more information on the limits to American intelligence agencies\u2019 access to European data, and on how Europeans can file legal claims in the United States.American officials have argued that their proposals will stand up to European legal challenges. They also believe the United States has levels of data protection comparable to those in the European Union, where privacy is valued as highly as freedom of expression.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to make major changes,\u201d Bruce H. Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, said on Jan. 15. \u201cThe U.S. takes individuals\u2019 privacy very seriously.\u201dAny company \u2014 large or small \u2014 that transfers information between the two regions may face legal challenges. But the most likely targets for litigation, privacy advocates say, are large American tech giants like Google and Facebook that rely so heavily on people\u2019s data.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.But if a new pact is not approved \u2014 or does not meet national regulators\u2019 standards \u2014 some European privacy watchdogs may demand new limits on the movement of data.Several consumer groups plan to file complaints about how companies transfer data as soon as Monday, arguing that people\u2019s rights are not upheld when information is moved to the United States.\u201cThese issues are going to end up back in court,\u201d said Peter Swire, a law professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who helped negotiate the original safe harbor agreement while working for the Clinton administration.The importance of the deal to the companies and privacy groups has crystallized in recent weeks, as American executives and government officials made it a top priority.At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for instance, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of the social network Facebook, held high-level discussions with a number of European and American politicians to voice the company\u2019s concerns about the pending deadline, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.Secretary Pritzker also met with Andrus Ansip, the European official in charge of the region\u2019s digital agenda, among other local policy makers, at Davos to discuss the new pact.On their way to negotiations in Brussels, a delegation of American officials made a stop in Paris last week, sitting down with a group of European national regulators to address concerns over how their citizens\u2019 data was used in the United States.In Brussels, several trade groups regularly shuttled between meetings with senior European officials last week. The groups representing the tech industry came armed with a series of legal opinions from leading data protection experts that played down the differences in the way privacy was handled in the two regions.The legal arguments included details about why current United States rules were on par with those of Europe \u2014 a view that critics of America\u2019s position jumped on almost immediately.\u201cThat assessment just isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has called for stronger data protection rules. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference over how this issue is treated in Europe compared to the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Super Bowl Pressure, for Advertisers as Well as Teams", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosOn a recent Sunday morning, the actor Eugene Levy crouched next to an industrial fan at a sound stage in Queens. A nearby smoke machine cloaked Mr. Levy and everyone else on the set in a gray haze.\u201cHow many shots do they need to blow some air up a dress?\u201d Mr. Levy asked, peering at the actress standing on a platform above him.The line was among those Mr. Levy was trying out as part of the script, but it was also the question many on the production team were most likely asking themselves, as the director ordered take after take to make sure every detail was just right.The average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has increased roughly 50 percent in the last decade when adjusted for inflation, according to data provided by WPP\u2019s Kantar Media. And this year is more expensive than ever, putting blockbuster-level pressure on brands to produce ads that justify the hefty price tag.Advertisers are reticent about how much they spend to produce Super Bowl ads, but an average commercial during the game costs more than $160,000 a second for the commercial time alone. In a loose comparison, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d cost roughly $25,000 a second to produce.Advertisers have sought for years to milk more attention from their Super Bowl spots, releasing online teasers and creating contests on social media, among assorted bells and whistles. But with the media landscape undergoing constant change and becoming ever more varied, there is also an underlying anxiety about how best to reach people.Even as advertising dollars shift online, television commercials \u2014 particularly during live events like the Super Bowl that draw huge audiences\u2014 are still in many ways the surest way to get in front of the most eyeballs at once. The Super Bowl also appeals to advertisers because many viewers are just as eager to watch the commercials as they are to watch the game.But it also comes with a big risk: If the ads flop \u2014 or worse, create backlash \u2014 they can be an embarrassment and a big waste of money. A commercial for Nationwide insurance during last year\u2019s Super Bowl that showed a young boy lamenting the things he would never be able to do \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll never learn to ride a bike. I won\u2019t get cooties.\u201d \u2014 because he had died from a preventable accident was quickly derided for being too morose. The executive who oversaw the spot has since left the company.The high cost of Super Bowl ads also comes at a time when many brands are looking to cut their overall advertising budgets. So the decision to hand over millions of dollars for a single commercial is not one advertisers take lightly.\u201cObviously, everyone takes a look at the cost of the Super Bowl investment,\u201d said Matt Montei, senior marketing director for Wrigley confections, which includes Skittles.To justify that spending, many brands are now looking for more ways to hold consumers\u2019 attention once the commercials go off the air. Nearly every brand has a social media strategy. Google and Facebook both introduced new Super Bowl-related offerings in recent weeks to help advertisers further infiltrate viewers\u2019 second screens.\u201cWe have a whole war room set up at the agency,\u201d said Dean Evans, the chief marketing officer for Hyundai Motor America, which will run two 30-second spots during the game and two 60-second spots before the game.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to use TV and the Super Bowl to get our name out there,\u201d said Phil Bienert, the chief marketing officer of GoDaddy. He said that advertising during the Super Bowl was like \u201cplaying Powerball\u201d because there are so many ads that it is difficult to stand out. Last year, 39 companies, some with multiple brands, ran ads during the Super Bowl. Snickers, however, is willing to play the lottery. At the Queens soundstage, the actor Willem Dafoe \u2014 playing the part of a cranky, hungry Marilyn Monroe \u2014 wore a white dress and heels, which gave him some difficulty as he stood on the subway grate reading his lines. At one point, he yelled that someone in his line of sight was distracting him, sending the production team scrambling to remove the offender so that shooting, which was scheduled to take all day, could resume.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d said Peter Kain, executive creative director at BBDO New York, the ad agency working with Snickers. \u201cThey spend so much money on it, and they want their money\u2019s worth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How to find those influencers with really big followings and get them on her side?Ms. Ong began using the platform about a year ago and now most of her marketing budget is devoted to YouTube videos. It\u2019s been successful for her. Love With Food\u2019s revenue last year was about $5 million, year-over-year sales are up 15 percent and the cost of acquiring a customer is down 30 percent.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean these smaller players don\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just means they haven\u2019t been able to find each other.\u201dFameBit allows a small business like Love With Food to advertise opportunities for small to midsize influencers to feature its product or service in videos. These influencers are not great YouTube stars but have sizable, loyal followings. They are also entrepreneurs, whose revenue comes from ads and corporate sponsors whose products or services they feature.Influencers with at least 5,000 subscribers on YouTube, Instagram, Vine, Twitter, Tumblr or Facebook can use FameBit.FameBit recently teamed up with the e-commerce platform Shopify to enable FameBit\u2019s influencers to open online stores. Likewise, brands using Shopify can search for influencers on FameBit to promote their products.High-priced influencers with millions of subscribers are generally out of reach for small businesses and are often part of multichannel networks, which function like talent agencies. The networks aggregate YouTube videos around niche topics like beauty, fashion or food and sell ads against it, while providing the YouTube stars they represent with production, promotion and marketing services. In exchange, the networks take a fairly substantial cut of the ad revenue, Mr. Verna said.Although influencer marketing got its start on YouTube, it has expanded in the last year to encompass other video platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Periscope. That is because video creators are increasingly seen as the best way to reach young consumers.Most entities that offer to connect YouTube talent with brands function as a kind of middleman, facilitating the connection. FameBit\u2019s marketplace is different, allowing influencers and brands to connect directly with one another, in real time. Brands can sign up free, and when an influencer is hired, payment is held until the content is created, approved and published. FameBit takes a 10 percent fee from both sides of the transaction. Its revenue now is about $1 million a month. The company, which is profitable, raised $1.5 million a year ago.\u201cIt enables brands to still get their messages across,\u201d said Mr. Verna at eMarketer.Most brands on FameBit pay influencers $500 to $2,000 to feature a product or service. More than 23,000 influencers \u2014 largely video creators \u2014 use the platform now, Ms. Kozera said, as do more than 3,500 brands, from smaller start-ups like Dollar Shave Club to much bigger names like Adidas and L\u2019Oreal.Although she was a part of the multichannel network StyleHaul before using FameBit, Ms. Lane\u2019s first opportunities to work with brands came through FameBit. She gets offers for brand partnerships through StyleHaul, but says those opportunities are presented to her at StyleHaul\u2019s discretion; she doesn\u2019t get to pitch herself directly to brands.\u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t getting those offers when I was smaller and first starting out,\u201d she said. \u201cFameBit was where I got my start with brand partnerships.\u201dWhen her video channel first started, Ms. Lane earned about 5 percent of her revenue from integrating brands into videos and the rest came from Google ads.\u201cAs my influence went up I was able to ask for more money, because my platform had a bigger reach,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, even though every video I do isn\u2019t sponsored, a solid 50 percent of my income is from sponsored content.\u201dShe is very careful about the products and brands with which she works. \u201cI only work with those I really like, otherwise it could negatively affect both my credibility and the brand\u2019s.\u201d Ms. Lane always discloses if a video is sponsored by a particular brand. She now earns between four and five figures a month, depending on the time of year and industries she is covering.Engagement is what is believable to consumers, not celebrity, Mr. Curtis said. \u201cIf the influencer is considered an expert in a particular area and their subscribers follow them because of that, those subscribers will also listen to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicines to Keep Addiction Away", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Second of two articlesThis week, another idea whose time has come: trying to kick opioid addiction without medicines is as smart as relying on willpower to overcome diabetes or asthma. Medicines greatly increase the chance of success and reduce the risk of death.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there now.Methadone, a liquid opioid that patients must drink every day under supervision at a methadone clinic, has been in use since the Vietnam War; it was approved to help the many soldiers coming back with heroin addiction. Before that, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreatment\u00e2\u0080\u009d usually consisted of a) jail and b) nothing else.Suboxone, approved to treat addiction in 2002, is a pill (in generic form) or film that dissolves under the tongue, and is prescribed by a doctor for home use. It combines two drugs, the opioid buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist that makes buprenorphine less prone to abuse. If the pill or film is crushed and snorted or injected, the naloxone blocks the high.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important beginning. But laws blocking access need changing as well. For example, doctors must be trained and certified by the federal government to prescribe Suboxone, and may treat only 100 patients at a time.In part, these laws are designed to guard against illegal resale of the drug.But the laws also reflect many Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unease with opioid maintenance therapy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is still some level of pervasive stigma against medication,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in an interview last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people still think there is some hierarchy of who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more in recovery \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people who are not on this versus people who are. It can be a real barrier for some people for whom these medications are totally appropriate.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt Gosnold on Cape Cod, an addiction treatment organization, a majority of patients use Vivitrol after they leave residential treatment, said Kristoph Pydynkowski, a recovery manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really helps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how many people said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was out there at a using spot, driving down the street, and then I turned around: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on Vivitrol. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not doing that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn 2012, Sheriff James M. Cummings of Barnstable County, Mass., began offering it to inmates in the Barnstable County House of Corrections. Vivitrol is part of a larger program to help keep inmates from coming back, which includes job counseling and connections to social services. Inmates get the injection right before they leave prison (Alkermes, the drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maker, donates it to the jail) and set up plans for counseling and continuing Vivitrol shots once they leave.About 200 inmates have received Vivitrol so far. Cummings said that 50 percent remain sober, and only 12 percent have ended up back behind bars.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with the worst of the worst \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people whose addiction is so bad they ended up committing crimes and going to jail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On the other hand, the inmates who volunteer to get Vivitrol are likely a more motivated group than those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.Barnstable was one of the first jails in the country to use Vivitrol. Many corrections officials from elsewhere have visited the program, and some have started their own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I like is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a narcotic, has no street value, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something going to be diverted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cummings said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little frustrated that it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been taken on by more correctional facilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial to have some options in a field with very few, especially when many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want Suboxone. There are 16,000 Americans on Vivitrol, said Richard Pops, chief executive of Alkermes, and 1 million on methadone and Suboxone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the correct ratio is, but 100 to 1 it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Richard Rosenthal, a co-principal investigator on the latest study who is medical director of addiction psychiatry at Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System in New York, said that Probuphine was designed to solve three problems with Suboxone. One was the chance of resale or accidental exposure to the pills. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the opportunity for non-adherence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people forget, or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take their dose, which leaves them vulnerable again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The other issue is that medicines have peaks and troughs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople on various medications may have increased cravings during those troughs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Read previous contributions to this series.I spoke with a man named David, a firefighter in a Boston suburb who wanted to be identified only by his first name. After doing well on Suboxone, he participated in the latest trial of Probuphine. When he was taking the pill, he said, he could feel it kick in every morning, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike drinking a good cup of coffee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the implant there was a much more consistent feeling of normalcy. I just felt perfectly normal all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd some medicines have what A.A. lacks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 scientific evidence of success.There is evidence, though, for medication.Only 1 percent of people treated for alcohol problems in the United States are prescribed medications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to understand that while 12-step programs may be very helpful for many people, there are many people who suffer from these disorders who need more than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bradley Stein, a psychiatrist who is senior natural scientist at the RAND Corporation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same way other chronic diseases don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a single intervention, we need other tools in our toolbox. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Calls Apple\u2019s Refusal to Unlock iPhone a \u2018Marketing Strategy\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department, frustrated by its inability to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino killings, demanded on Friday that a judge immediately order Apple to give it the technical tools to get inside the phone.Apple\u2019s refusal \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy\u201d rather than a legal rationale, prosecutors said in a court filing that further escalated the confrontation between the Obama administration and Apple.\u201cThis is not the end of privacy,\u201d the Justice Department declared, a mocking reference to Apple\u2019s rationale for contesting the court order prosecutors obtained from a judge directing Apple to help them break into the phone.The sharply worded, 25-page motion to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation seemed aimed as much at swaying public opinion as influencing the federal magistrate judge in Riverside, Calif., who issued the order to Apple.A blistering open letter this week from Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, had rallied many privacy advocates behind the company, and law enforcement officials said that the latest volley from the Justice Department on Friday was meant largely to rebut Mr. Cook\u2019s arguments and buttress the government\u2019s own case.Apple executives, speaking with reporters after the filing on the condition that they not be identified by name, said they were puzzled by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to rush back into court before the company even had a chance to respond to this week\u2019s court order.They reiterated their concerns that the government\u2019s novel demands would endanger the privacy and security of all of their iPhone customers in the future, and said they remained determined to fight the government\u2019s demands.Apple has until next week to respond to an order by a California magistrate this week compelling it to provide the technical assistance that the F.B.I. says it needs to get into the phone.But the Justice Department sought to pre-empt Apple\u2019s response with its own filing on Friday, saying Apple has already made its opposition publicly known and that the \u201curgency of this investigation\u201d demands faster action.\u201cRather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court\u2019s order,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cApple has responded by publicly repudiating that order.\u201dThey went on to accuse Apple of exaggerating how difficult it would be for the company\u2019s computer engineers to come up with a way to get into the phone and to disable an \u201cauto-erase\u201d feature that permanently deletes the data inside after 10 failed password attempts.The Justice Department filed this motion on Friday asking a federal judge to immediately force Apple to help open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.\u201cAt no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the order or that the order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging software development task,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cOn this point, Apple\u2019s silence speaks volumes.\u201dThe Justice Department wants to force Apple to write software that would allow the government to try millions of random password combinations to get into the phone.Apple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company\u2019s engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.The Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone \u2014 something the company does regularly.Apple executives acknowledged on Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.In his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Mr. Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a \u201cchilling\u201d attack on privacy and Internet security.Apple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Mr. Cook\u2019s strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company\u2019s business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple\u2019s business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.With this week\u2019s dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to Apple and the F.B.I. on inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a hearing.The lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the public debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations \u201chas now come to a critical juncture\u201d with this week\u2019s order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.The Justice Department\u2019s latest filing on Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.Among other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the F.B.I concluded, none of those options would work. Among other problems, the default system that backed up the phone on the iCloud had been disabled \u2014 apparently by Mr. Farook \u2014 in October, six weeks before the shootings.In its filing, the Justice Department suggested repeatedly that Apple has put its \u201cmarketing concerns\u201d above its corporate responsibility to comply with a lawful order to assist law enforcement.\u201cApple is not above the law in that regard,\u201d the filing said.Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Week\u2019s Shift Toward Diversity", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cI haven\u2019t heard applause like that for one of Zac\u2019s shows in a long time,\u201d said Bethann Hardison, a former model and agent, and an industry gadfly for diversity. \u201cZac set the tone for the rest of the week.\u201dAt Mr. Posen\u2019s show on Monday night and in those of a telling handful of others this week, fashion, so it seemed, had performed an abrupt about-face.Well before the Oscars stirred a diversity debate, Seventh Avenue had been the target of stinging criticism for the sin of omission, routinely parading mostly white models on its runways.In this latest round of shows, which ended on Thursday, many designers appeared to have taken a hard look at the highly charged issue of casting, stepping up their efforts to hire racial and ethnic minorities and sounding a chord for inclusiveness.That note resonated throughout the week. Multiracial runways may have been expected in willfully subversive collections like Puma x Fenty by Rihanna, Hood by Air, Telfar and Gypsy Sport, their producers scouring Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for models of varying ethnicities. Yet elsewhere it took spectators by surprise. Shows like those of Rosie Assoulin, Sophie Theallet and Tory Burch offered a bracing cocktail of skin tones.There is no official tally of African-Americans populating the catwalks this week, but show-by-show estimates range in number from four or five at Anna Sui to 25 at Zac Posen and Xuly.B\u00ebt, whose designer, Lamine Kouyat\u00e9, had been vocal earlier this month about his intention to cast an all-black show.But his mission proved daunting. On the eve of his show on Wednesday, Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 had signed only 15 young women.\u201cEven that wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d his publicist Kelly Cutrone said. \u201cThere still aren\u2019t that many black models at the agencies, and the ones that there are tend to be inexperienced. They haven\u2019t had an opportunity to walk in many shows.\u201dMr. Kouyat\u00e9 was frustrated. \u201cSince the 1970s, women of color have given input to the industry,\u201d he said, referring to racially mixed runway extravaganzas of designers like Yves Saint Laurent. \u201cWhere are girls like that now?\u201dIn Paris, Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 noted, Olivier Rousteing of Balmain made a striking contribution to multiracial casting. Why not here? he asked.\u201cSo much inspiration has been taken from black culture,\u201d Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 said, ascribing a rekindled fascination with African-American style and culture to the popularity of stars like Alicia Keys, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cThey are the ones who have the power,\u201d he said.For all that, Ms. Hardison is seeing signs of progress. \u201cToday there\u2019s a market for these models,\u201d she said from her front-row perch at Xuly.B\u00ebt. \u201cThat says something.\u201dA heightened resolve to mingle skin tones on the runways was heralded by a spate of fashion advertisements in the spring glossies \u2014 dark-skinned models featured in previously white-dominated campaigns of C\u00e9line, Kate Spade, Chanel and Valentino, among others, the marketers apparently redoubling their efforts to be inclusive and to court a black consumer.\u201cYoung people of color still are underrepresented on the runway,\u201d said Kevin Amato, a casting guru for labels like Telfar, V-Files and Calvin Klein. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who want to wear the clothes, so we should be reflecting back to them versions of themselves on the runway.\u201dAs Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 insisted on doing at Xuly.B\u00ebt, bringing out, to the muted strains of a cello, a parade of restitched and recycled athletic jerseys, parkas, vibrantly colorful catsuits and faux furs to an audience that was, in roughly equal parts, white and black. Spectators leaned forward in their seats to gather an eyeful of the searingly bright street-inspired clothes.Ms. Hardison was ebullient. Black models have indeed made advances since she began agitating for racial inclusiveness in a town hall gathering of industry leaders nearly a decade ago. She is watchful, just the same.\u201cRacism lays so dormantly, but it\u2019s there,\u201d Ms. Hardison said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to keep after it, poking away.\u201dCheck out our complete New York Fashion Week coverage here.Advertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton are racing toward a general election matchup, according to a new poll that shows the presidential candidates with dominant national leads atop their parties.The results reflect the strongest support to date for Mr. Trump, who has benefited from the shrinking Republican field, and set him up well for this week\u2019s Super Tuesday races, when nearly a dozen contests could fortify his delegate lead.Voters say Mr. Trump is best suited to solve the country\u2019s problems and handle the job of commander in chief.

On that question, Mr. Sanders is seen as stronger, with 59 percent thinking he is the more honest Democratic candidate.While only four states have held primary contests so far, most Republicans and Democrats expect Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton to face off in November.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Yet right around now, Mr. Astrada should be in Myanmar, about eight months since he left his home base in Barcelona, Spain, on Athena, his Royal Enfield motorcycle laden with clothes, supplies and camera gear. He has gone over the Pyrenees, into Turkey, up to Vladivostok, Russia, over to South Korea (by ferry) and, most recently, India (by plane).There have been mechanical failures, unexpected delays and bureaucratic nightmares, not to mention the Korean hotel vending machine he thought sold soda, but actually dispensed sex toys. Yet, during a phone interview last week, Mr. Astrada sounded upbeat about how his impulsive decision one day while covering Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cholera outbreak in 2010 has gotten him halfway around the world, where he goes out taking pictures for himself, not some assignment editor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you have to think a lot about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said by phone from a small town in India near the Myanmar border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think too much, in the end you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never do it. I wanted to go around the world, and I thought I could do it by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo hear him tell it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with enough feeling to make deskbound editors long to toss off the shackles of meetings and budgets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his journey wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about taking time to think, but making time to experience. With almost 20 years as a photojournalist, Mr. Astrada has covered everything from Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earthquake or conflict in Africa, to longer projects on violence against women or people living with multiple sclerosis. As a news photographer, he was used to rituals of blowing into town, covering the breaking story and leaving. While that may be good for news, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of grind that hardly leaves little time to get to know a place. This time, he wanted the freedom to explore and do street photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had lost sight of what I had before, to go out with my camera and make pictures of whatever caught my attention, without thinking of any specific reportage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking with news agencies, especially once the news is over, many times we forget there is daily life that continues in these places. In some ways this idea was to complete the other part of what you never get to cover when you do news.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFiguring out that he wanted to travel light and be as self-sufficient as possible, he settled on going by motorcycle, a Royal Enfield built in India, first learning how to ride one at a driving school in Spain. In keeping with his theme of self-sufficiency, he enrolled in a motorcycle repair class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he used to be an airplane mechanic, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handy with tools and motors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he figured he might be in some remote places. That proved the case when a spring broke while he was on a deserted road to Uzbekistan.One truth at the root of The Journey is something essential: the lure of the road, the ability to stop and go as one pleases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of course, making accommodations for bureaucrats, the police and border crossings. Some places he wanted to see \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Florence, for Michelangelo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s masterpieces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while others would have to wait; his Iranian visa came through too late, since he had to get to Vladivostok by October. If he found a place was to his liking, he might stay longer than planned, which is what happened in Tbilisi, Georgia.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plan is there is no plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI adapted as I went along. That is the beauty of going by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut another important aspect of his trek speaks to the universality of the human experience, for better or worse. Cellphones turn up in the unlikeliest places, he noted, as did traffic that could rival New York\u2019s.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I got to Ulan Bator, it was like being on Fifth Avenue in a traffic jam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the Mongolian capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have this idea in our heads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the tourist idea \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that people continue to live as they did in a previous era, when in reality the world has evolved. The idea of this trip is to see how similar we are, as well as how we have differences. In truth, television and movies have influenced so much. In the end, all the globalization of technology and the economy means a lot of things are similar.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor now, Mr. Astrada is going to base himself in Southeast Asia for about a year, giving workshops and being able to take on assignments. After that, his plan is to go to North America and, he hopes, Latin America. And for all his traveling, he has come up with one project he feels he must do: a deep look at Argentina, the homeland in which he has not lived for some 19 years.But those plans can wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis trip has made me enjoy taking pictures more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the excitement of being somewhere without the pressure to make pictures and being able to share life in a different way, to see what people do every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

John Kasich desperately needs a strong showing here, and he has done his darnedest to make it happen, crisscrossing the state to hold 96 town-hall meetings, by his count. He has repeatedly pledged that if he gets \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrounced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he is going back to his home state of Ohio. And yet, for a candidate whose campaign is tied to the deliberations of voters here, he is uncannily, almost incongruously, relaxed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the hands of the people of New Hampshire. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to get manic, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not panicked, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not throwing a Hail Mary, if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Kasich, in front of a crowd of at least 100 gathered at an inn on Wednesday.Mr. Kasich, who calls himself the \u00e2\u0080\u009chappy warrior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d comports himself at campaign events with a mellowness that he hopes will allow him to rise above the fray of a bitter campaign. He has consistently avoided directly attacking his competitors, even as he notes that some of them are attacking him, and his supporters frequently refer to him as the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cadult\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the race. But those same appeals can sometimes seem so calm as to lack urgency, and he has sometimes purposely avoided opportunities to specify exactly what, or whom, it is from which he is differentiating himself since he rarely mentions his opponents by name. It remains to be seen how that strategy will play out in a crowded field with the clock ticking down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould he be more explicit about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fergus Cullen, a former state Republican Party chairman who recently announced his support for Mr. Kasich.Mr. Cullen then tried out a possible campaign line for Mr. Kasich: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look, folks, I know there are people in this room who are thinking about Chris Christie, thinking about Marco Rubio, thinking about Jeb Bush, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I think you ought to support me over them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He could do that, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chosen not to. At this point, I think he has to stay the course.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo on a day when Donald J. Trump said Senator Ted Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u009cstole\u00e2\u0080\u009d his win in the Iowa caucuses (Mr. Kasich, who campaigned little in Iowa, won 2 percent of the vote), and as Gov. Chris Christie found a litany of ways to call Senator Marco Rubio inexperienced, Mr. Kasich sidestepped opportunities to go negative.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not interested in attacking other candidates, O.K.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said, recounting what he had told to reporters at a breakfast that morning.Instead, here and at three other stops over the course of the day, he pivoted from topic to topic with no teleprompter or apparent narrative arc, speaking at length of balancing budgets, building consensus to achieve political goals, and the opiate crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 New Hampshire has been hit hard by heroin addiction.Occasionally, he took sideways swipes at his opponents without naming them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many people think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to abolish the I.R.S. And have a 10 percent flat tax? Raise your hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Kasich, in a reference to proposals from Senator Ted Cruz. No one did. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey keep saying it, and no one here believes it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the whole thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said.And later, on foreign policy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeware of bombast. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run foreign policy by yelling and screaming and threatening to do things 10 months before you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even in office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said.It is a demeanor that many voters have found refreshing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole positive message came through pretty strongly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jim Gracyzk, a retired electrical engineer who attended an event for Mr. Kasich in a smoky-smelling V.F.W.

{"Headline": "Iowa\u2019s Black Caucusgoers", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byOn Monday, Iowans will become the first people in the nation to officially express their choices for the next president of the United States.But what interested me in particular was that a subset of those voters will be black. And since black voters in national polls are overwhelmingly Democratic and overwhelmingly prefer Hillary Clinton to her rivals, it seemed important to explore how these voters are processing this election cycle and its candidates.Over three days in Des Moines \u2014 from Friday to Sunday \u2014 I interviewed more than 30 black people, and spoke briefly to many more at a black church, a black-owned barbershop, a popular soul food restaurant and at African-American social events.My first impression from these conversations was that there existed a staggering level of ambivalence and absence of enthusiasm. A surprising number of people said that they were undecided and started an answer with the clause, \u201cIf I had to choose \u2026\u201dFurthermore, there also seemed to be a generational divide between the people who felt more embraced and informed by the political campaigns \u2014 the older ones, and those who felt more abandoned or ignored by them \u2014 the younger ones.As Wayne Ford, co-founder and co-chairman of the Iowa Brown and Black Forum, told me Sunday, the level of excitement in the black community is \u201cnowhere near where it was 2008\u201d when Barack Obama was a candidate.Also, the preference for Clinton over Bernie Sanders was a two-pronged assessment; it was a sophisticated weighing of comfort and of policy without an absolutism of good vs. bad, but rather a matter of degrees better or worse, more real or more fantasy.On the policy front, many simply found Sanders\u2019s policies unrealistically ambitious, an over-promising of giveaways. As one woman put it, \u201cHe sounds like Oprah: \u2018You get a car! And you get a car! And you get a car!\u2019 How is he going to pay for all that?\u201dClinton\u2019s ambitions seemed to be judged more realistic.Then, there was the problem of comfort.The Clintons seem to intuitively understand the value of retail politics, particularly when doing outreach to marginalized groups. I can\u2019t tell you how many stories I\u2019ve heard from black people about the time that one of the Clintons \u2014 most often Bill Clinton \u2014 spoke at or showed up at an event important to the black community.This means something. It adds to an aura of familiarity that doesn\u2019t extend to Sanders.This year for the first time a straw poll was taken at the event, and Clinton got more votes than all other candidates combined.But it seemed to me that the support was remarkably soft. People, in general, weren\u2019t charging toward passion but slumping toward acquiescence.The next day, Bill Clinton strode into the Corinthian Baptist Church \u2014 accompanied by Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee. While Hillary had spoken for just a few minutes at the previous day\u2019s event, Bill spoke so long at the church that there was no time left for a sermon.Bill Clinton seems to understand the powerful role the griot plays in black culture, and he channels that spirit when he speaks, far more than any non-black candidate I\u2019ve seen.For Sanders\u2019s part, he seemed to be judged too unfamiliar and too absent, particularly down the homestretch. This feels to me like a terrible tactical error. No matter how much his positions and policies may benefit black voters, they are no more interested than any other group of voters in a long-distance love affair. You have to show up. You have to put in the time.It is true that in the last census, blacks were only 3.7 percent of the population in Iowa, but that vote matters, not only for Iowa but also as a harbinger for those who will come after.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, the Bush team made official what had long been an open secret \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that former President George W. Bush will hit the campaign trail on Monday evening with his younger brother in North Charleston, S.C.The decision to deploy the former president, who remains popular with the Republican base, especially in South Carolina with its large military and veteran population, comes as the state has emerged as crucial to the Jeb Bush campaign as it seeks to keep nervous donors from bolting.Jeb Bush hopes to leverage his fourth-place to finish in New Hampshire, just ahead of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, into a strong showing in a state that still regards the Bush family fondly.But having George W. campaign for his brother has been a delicate issue for the campaign. Jeb Bush has struggled with how to handle his famous last name, and with the reality that some voters simply do not want to see another Bush in the White House. Early on in the campaign, Mr. Bush bungled a question about if he would have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as his brother did, with the intelligence available today. At first, he said he would have, only to backpedal and say several days later than he had misunderstood the original question.But South Carolina is now a critical state for Mr. Bush, just as it was for his brother in 2000.

{"Headline": "Why Women Proposing Is Still Rare", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byField NotesWhen uttered by a man, the words \u201cwill you marry me\u201d serve to signal a tradition that is both widely accepted and ages old. Having the same spoken by a woman however \u2014 except in a leap year like 2016, when an old Irish tradition of having the woman ask is known to emerge \u2014 are still surprisingly rare.Legend has it that \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 Privilege,\u201d as it was known then, originated in the fifth century, with an Irish nun later known as St. Brigid. Through her intervention it was decided that on Feb. 29, women would be given the opportunity to pop the question as a way to balance traditional gender roles in a manner not unlike how leap year serves to balance the calendar.On the face of it, giving a woman an occasion to ask a man to wed would seem an empowering moment. But not everyone sees it that way. \u201cThe leap year tradition looked like it was giving women opportunities but in reality, it kept them in their place,\u201d said Katherine Parkin, an associate professor of history at Monmouth University in New Jersey. \u201cBack then women who asked men to marry were portrayed as ugly, mannish, crass or desperate.\u201dCenturies later, women are still using this bit of folklore as an impetus to get down on one knee and ask for their partner\u2019s hand in marriage \u2014 on a Feb. 29 or on any day in a leap year.In February 2012, Dana Sessa and Kevin McGettigan of Fairless Hills, Pa., had been together for seven years when she began to become concerned that both the calendar and biology were creeping up on her. Ms. Sessa already had a child from a previous relationship.\u201cI knew we wanted more children. So time was ticking,\u201d she said. But no marriage proposal had been put on the table. \u201cI knew he had been thinking of it, but sometimes a girl has to take things into her own hands to get things done,\u201d she said.Then Ms. Sessa, now 35 and who says she\u2019s \u201chalf Irish,\u201d heard that \u201cThe Rachael Ray Show\u201d was looking for women who were willing to propose to their man on a special leap year segment on the show. Mr. McGettigan \u201cis full Irish,\u201d she said, \u201cso the leap year tradition fit well into our theme.\u201dMr. McGettigan, now 34, had been lured into appearing on the show that Feb. 29 to be interviewed about a dietary matter when during the taping Ms. Sessa got down on one knee with a ring box in hand and asked him to marry her.\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters who asks whom,\u201d Ms. Sessa recently said.Some women don\u2019t need leap year to step up and ask what they want.Alexandra Pavlenko asked Alexander Tague to marry her on April 13, 2015. \u201cI asked Alex for two reasons; I was madly in love with him and nothing about asking him felt wrong to me,\u201d said Ms. Tague, 32. \u201cHe said something about how much he loved me, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m crazy in love with you and do you want a reminder of that every day?\u2019\u201dMr. Tague, 33, who lives with Ms. Pavlenko in Brooklyn, said he did. She then brought out the rings she ordered on Etsy and presented them to him. Mr. Tague said yes right away.\u201cFor women like me who live in New York City it\u2019s almost chic to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, there was something very empowering about not having to wait for the man you love to ask you.\u201dAlthough girlfriends say how great it is that she asked him, Ms. Pavlenko added those same friends \u201cadmit that they could never do something like that\u201d themselves.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more couple-level negotiations in the marriage process with college-educated women and that\u2019s a real sign of progress,\u201d said Amanda Miller, a sociology professor at the University of Indianapolis. \u201cThough women have more power to move the relationship closer to marriage, they still want the man to ask. That\u2019s considered his job.\u201dThat thinking, Professor Miller added, shows no sign of dissipating.For as many traditions as we cast aside \u2013 church marriages replaced by married on a beach, a minister replaced by a web-ordained college friend \u2014 there are just as many traditions we still cling to. A man proposing to a woman is the one that has changed the least.\u201cA man asking a woman to wed is a ritual that\u2019s very powerful,\u201d said Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, where he is an associate professor of sociology.\u201cHaving him ask for her hand in marriage is a way of signaling to her, and his friends and family, that he\u2019s serious and ready for a future with her,\u201d Professor Wilcox said. \u201cThe guy who proposes in the basketball arena is sending a massive signal to the world that he\u2019s all in and completely committed.\u201dJust as an engagement ring has been a symbol of a man\u2019s ability to provide, some wonder if the proposal hasn\u2019t taken on a similar significance.\u201cHer fear might be if she asks and he says yes, he\u2019s going along to get along,\u201d Professor Wilcox added. \u201cGetting that formal proposal from him is one way of addressing that concern.\u201dEven the rise of same-sex couples, an area of great change, has seen little movement of the proposal pendulum among heterosexual ones.\u201cA woman asking a man is disrupting a sacrosanct power that men have held throughout American history,\u201d Professor Parkin said. \u201cSame-sex proposals have not changed traditional heterosexual ones because, within that couple, there is a balance due to the fact that they are the same sex. They are not providing an alternative for what continues to be the narrow rules of getting engaged.\u201dWedding planners, too, see almost no movement in the area of \u201cthe ask.\u201dMichele Velazquez is an owner, with her husband, Marvin Velazquez, of The Heart Bandits, a Los Angeles proposal-planning company that creates and orchestrates about three dozen marriage proposals for couples a month. To date they\u2019ve had only two women propose to their boyfriends.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change or shift,\u201d said Ms. Velazquez, 36. \u201cWomen traditionally want to be courted, and men still want to propose. Most men are not comfortable being asked.\u201d She added: \u201cMen can feel powerless or rushed. They think, \u2018Why isn\u2019t she waiting. I want to do it on my time.\u2019 \u201dIf the woman asks, she may resent that decision years later, Ms. Velazquez said. \u201cIf she jumps the gun, five years down the line that action might backfire. She might say to her husband: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you ask me? I don\u2019t have the great story to tell people about how you proposed.\u2019\u201dAnd what better way to tell that story than on social media. Despite our share-all mentality, in which one click equals global announcement, people still care about how they\u2019re seen by others.\u201cWomen don\u2019t want to be seen as less feminine, or too sexual or coming on too strong. And there\u2019s a concern for men about being publicly emasculated,\u201d said Beth Montemurro, a professor of sociology at Penn State University.\u201cWhen you look at how public social media makes things, it could be holding people back,\u201d Professor Montemurro said. \u201cThey may be afraid to take bigger risks and break gender roles because they\u2019re concerned with how their story will come across.\u201dSpecialists also surmise that women aren\u2019t more forthcoming because they lack encouraging illustrations.\u201cWe don\u2019t have many positive examples\u201d of women who have proposed, Professor Parkin said. \u201cThose that have asked men have not been successful in our eyes. Pink and Britney Spears asked their men to marry, and those marriages either ended poorly or didn\u2019t do well in the beginning,\u201d she said, (although Pink reunited with her husband and they are still married).Professor Parkin supposed that, \u201cif Taylor Swift pops the question it might start a trend, but right now, it\u2019s not seen as romantic.\u201dAnd perhaps that\u2019s the conundrum.Mr. McGettigan, who was proposed to on television, recalled that the experience was shocking and exciting. But it also \u201cstole some of my thunder and flipped the script on me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mouth went dry. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201dThat response is very normal, Professor Miller said. \u201cWhen women ask men, there\u2019s no script for how they are supposed to react. Women scream or jump in the air. From our research, many men said having a woman propose to them wouldn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s also about controlling the timing of these events. When they ask, they advance the relationship.\u201dIronically, Mr. McGettigan had planned on asking Ms. Sessa to marry him.\u201cIt\u2019s been in the mix for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m eccentric. I don\u2019t like to do anything ordinary, but the things I was going to do were based on timing. We go to an annual balloon festival and we\u2019ve taken a few trips to different islands. She thought I was going to propose to her a couple of times, but it didn\u2019t feel quite right.\u201dTwo weeks after having been proposed to, Mr. McGettigan had his own moment, something men who have been asked to wed by their lady partners often want to have. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything and I\u2019m glad she did it, but I proposed to her on her birthday at home in front of her family and mine.\u201dAs for the romantic story women are always wishing for, the former Ms. Sessa (now McGettigan) feels that got it. \u201cWomen always believe in the fairy tale, that Prince Charming is coming to sweep you off your feet. That still happened to me\u201d she said. \u201cI still had the white dress, the destination wedding, the great honeymoon. I had what any person would have had if he had asked me first. The fact that asking him took his breath away, and that I was the one to do that, was an amazing feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Informant and the Filmmakers", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byFeatureHis name was Saeed Torres. He was 50 or so, a home-brewed Renaissance man with his own dance company and a collection of African drums. He liked to eat well, bake his own desserts and smoke weed. Torres appointed himself Cabral\u2019s ambassador to the neighborhood. He took her to weekend drum circles at Mount Morris Park. A few months later, he found her a new apartment, on the top floor of a three-story brownstone on 121st Street between Lenox and Seventh Avenues. He lived on the ground floor, where his wide circle of artist friends would visit for late-night jam sessions and meandering conversations.His life story, as he told it to Cabral, was intertwined with the militant wing of the African-American counterculture. Many years ago, he said, he had robbed subway-token booths and drug dealers and given the money back to the community. \u2018\u2018I grew up in the old school,\u2019\u2019 Torres would often tell Cabral. \u2018\u2018I got morals and principles.\u2019\u2019 He had an odd reformulation of the Golden Rule: \u2018\u2018I have always believed there is honor among thieves. You respect the next thief.\u2019\u2019 He said he had been a member of the Black Panther Party. He said he had been drafted into service during the Vietnam War. Cabral used his stories for a course in oral \u00adhistory she was taking at Columbia University. \u2018\u2018I thought he was cool,\u2019\u2019 Cabral told me. Torres said, \u2018\u2018She reminded me of my niece.\u2019\u2019Torres was something of a chameleon. Some days, Cabral would see him leave the brownstone in a suit, with a briefcase; other days it would be colorful African robes and sandals. He usually had a lot of cash on hand, though Cabral once lent him $2,000 when he was short, which he soon repaid. He had two cellphones and would often excuse himself before answering. He said he worked for the Legal Aid Society, which sometimes required him to travel abroad. In 2005, Torres suddenly moved out of his apartment. He called Cabral a few hours later. \u2018\u2018If anybody asks you anything about me,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018don\u2019t give them any information.\u2019\u2019 He had something important to tell her, he said, but she would need to hear it in person.Torres explained that he had been \u2018\u2018investigating Tarik\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018the F.B.I. was paying the rent\u2019\u2019 on his brownstone apartment. He did not use the word \u2018\u2018informant,\u2019\u2019 preferring to call himself a \u2018\u2018civilian operative.\u2019\u2019 Torres spoke of his work as though it were a service to the community \u2014 a making of amends for his past misdeeds. He saw himself as a guardian, the first line of defense in the war against terrorism.Cabral was familiar with the thorny moral problems that sometimes arose in her profession \u2014 the \u2018\u2018awkward dance,\u2019\u2019 she now calls it, between reporter and subject and their conflicting expectations of how the story would be told. The story that Cabral chose to tell about Torres is very different from the one he tells about himself. On Feb. 22, PBS\u2019s \u2018\u2018Independent Lens\u2019\u2019 will broadcast \u2018\u2018(T)error,\u2019\u2019 the documentary that Cabral and a colleague, David Felix Sutcliffe, would come to film about her old neighbor. Last year, \u2018\u2018(T)error\u2019\u2019 had its premiere at Sundance, where it won the Special Jury Award for Break Out First Feature.By some counts, nearly half of the 500-plus terrorism-related convictions in federal court since the Sept. 11 attacks have involved informants. Before \u2018\u2018(T)error,\u2019\u2019 most of what was known of their work came from indictments and snippets of wiretapped dialogue, served up by prosecutors and neatly presented for the courtroom. Filmed without the F.B.I.\u2019s cooperation and apparently without its knowledge, \u2018\u2018(T)error\u2019\u2019 shows how an informant puts a case together from its raw ingredients. (\u2018\u2018The F.B.I. is not in the business of disclosing details of those we work with,\u2019\u2019 said Stephanie Shark, a spokeswoman from the bureau\u2019s New York office, when asked about Torres. \u2018\u2018We aim to protect the identity and lives of the people we work with, even if they so choose to discuss their business publicly.\u2019\u2019)When Cabral and Sutcliffe screened \u2018\u2018(T)error\u2019\u2019 for Torres, he gave it four and a half out of five stars, complaining that he came across as too depressed. Cabral pointed out to him that the film is bookended by two moments of happiness. At the beginning, he\u2019s in the kitchen frosting a cake with his son. At the end, the F.B.I. has offered him a new assignment, though it would eventually fall through. In that conversation, Cabral was trying to show Torres that it was his work with the F.B.I. that was making him unhappy. \u2018\u2018Informants don\u2019t get to reflect,\u2019\u2019 she told me later. \u2018\u2018The F.B.I. would never encourage informants to think about these moral and ethical ramifications of their work.\u2019\u2019 In her eyes, the deepest treachery Torres committed may have been against himself.The courts have generally upheld informant-driven stings, as long as the target is given an opportunity to back out. \u2018\u2018Talking the talk alone is not what gets people prosecuted,\u2019\u2019 said Marc Raimondi, the national-security spokesman for the Department of Justice. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the willingness to walk the walk.\u2019\u2019The F.B.I. has used informants against targets \u2014 Communists, Mafiosi, Black Panthers, dirty politicians, Weathermen, drug dealers, white-collar fraudsters \u2014 for most of its history. But Muslim extremists have posed a unique challenge. In 2006, five years after the Sept. 11 attacks, fewer than 40 of the bureau\u2019s 12,000 agents had even a limited proficiency in Arabic; reportedly fewer than 20 were Muslim. Informants have filled the gap. By 2008, the F.B.I. was using thousands of them. None are considered employees, and they are often paid in cash.In his book \u2018\u2018The Terror Factory,\u2019\u2019 the journalist Trevor Aaronson argues that the F.B.I. targets \u2018\u2018punks\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018losers\u2019\u2019 \u2014 underemployed men on the fringes of society who would not have the means to become terrorists on their own. The book suggests that mosque-crawling informants are a bit like police officers who are filling their town\u2019s treasury through speed traps. Laws designed to keep the public safe from the most flagrant offenders wind up often catching borderline cases, men like Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American who pressed a keyboard button that he believed would detonate a truck bomb at a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore. He was 19 at the time and in the company of undercover F.B.I. agents, who provided him with the fake bomb.\u2018\u2018What are we supposed to do \u2014 turn our heads to this?\u2019\u2019 asked Peter Ahearn, a former head of the F.B.I.\u2019s Buffalo office. \u2018\u2018No. We\u2019re going to go and see how serious these guys are. And for every one that gets prosecuted, there are one or two or more that don\u2019t go anywhere.\u2019\u2019Torres told me that he has contributed to eight investigations. In court, Torres has testified that he first agreed to work with the bureau while in prison for armed robbery. Before the case against Shah, Torres worked on a sting operation targeting Mohammed Ali al-Moayad, who claimed to know Osama bin Laden and was convicted in 2005 of conspiring to provide financial support to Al Qaeda and Hamas.Aaronson\u2019s book catalogs the cases of more than 500 federal terrorism defendants and finds that fewer than 10 dealt with would-be terrorists who independently planned to carry out attacks on American soil. Far more were cultivated by the company of men like Torres. Shah, for example, collected jihadist books and mused about opening a training facility. But he hadn\u2019t come very close to joining Al Qaeda at the point he met Soufan, who Torres led him to believe was a recruiter for the group.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s like bait,\u2019\u2019 Torres says in the film, reflecting on the Shah case. \u2018\u2018Threw the hook out there. He bit into it.\u2019\u2019 Shah pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.He took a phone call from his auto mechanic; he seemed preoccupied by a coming trip and complained about the cost of a much-needed repair. Avoiding the word \u2018\u2018informant,\u2019\u2019 I asked him about his \u2018\u2018government work.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I know how they think,\u2019\u2019 he said of his targets. \u2018\u2018How they feel. Because everybody has larceny.\u2019\u2019 In their heart, I asked. Yes, he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s just what point of larceny would they go to and to whom would they manifest that larceny to? If you can reach their weakest point, you can bring that about.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018(T)error\u2019\u2019 begins in October 2011, with Torres moving to Pittsburgh to try to befriend an F.B.I. target, Khalifah Ali al-Akili, a convert to Islam and convicted drug felon. Torres brings along a new identity \u2014 a search-and-rescue dog-handler employed by the Red Cross \u2014 and rents an apartment a short walk away from his target\u2019s home. \u2018\u2018I ain\u2019t playing no character,\u2019\u2019 he tells the camera. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m playing who I am: a Muslim brother.\u2019\u2019Akili\u2019s apartment contains what F.B.I. agents would later describe as \u2018\u2018jihadist literature\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018books on U.S. military tactics.\u2019\u2019 The F.B.I. had been aware of him since at least 2005, when a prison source told them that Akili had \u00adtalked about going to fight overseas and given him \u2018\u2018anti-American\u2019\u2019 articles about \u2018\u2018supporting the mujahedeen.\u2019\u2019 Six years later, Akili does not seem to be pursuing any plans to join the insurgency. He works at the local food co-op and lives with his wife, a Somali-born British citizen, and their young daughter. But his insurgent dreams persist online, where he praises Osama bin Laden, posts pictures of himself in military fatigues and at a gun range and describes the United States as \u2018\u2018the belly of the beast.\u2019\u2019At a local mosque, Torres courts Akili and engages him in friendly conversation. Soon, the two begin riding together to prayers. The good will is all for show. In a voice-over, Torres declares that he and Akili have \u2018\u2018nothing in common at all \u2014 music-wise, politics, culture, none of it.\u2019\u2019Torres agreed to give Cabral and Sutcliffe access to his phone, and the film includes Torres\u2019s text messages to his handlers and Akili. In one text, Torres encourages Akili to watch a \u2018\u2018Taliban warrior\u2019\u2019 episode of \u2018\u2018Homeland.\u2019\u2019 The F.B.I. wants updates on Torres\u2019s progress and the target. Torres obliges but complains about the hard work and low pay. At one point, he claims that his monthly envelope of F.B.I. cash is $600 light.Sutcliffe and Cabral consulted lawyers who told them that what they were doing was legal, as long as they didn\u2019t interfere with the investigation. Trying to film Torres while he met with the F.B.I. or Akili, they decided, would be too risky. So their early filming hews closely to Torres and his cagey narrative of the case\u2019s progress. Standing before a map of Pittsburgh, he tacks up laminated photos of bearded men. \u2018\u2018They are all targets that\u2019s in suspected areas,\u2019\u2019 he says with a gravely official air. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have no feelings for them. You\u2019re making Islam look bad. You gotta go.\u2019\u2019 Sutcliffe, who was filming the scene, wondered whether this was going to be a higher-level operation than he expected. Then Sutcliffe noticed that one photo was of Adam Gadahn, an American-born Qaeda spokesman who had not been inside the United States for several years. \u2018\u2018He was totally trying to hustle us,\u2019\u2019 Sutcliffe told me.\u2018\u2018Have you ever had a target who was a friend or a family member?\u2019\u2019 she asks.\u2018\u2018Yeah, yeah, Shah!\u2019\u2019 Torres replies. \u2018\u2018Shah was my friend.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Was he your friend before you \u2014 \u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018He was my friend,\u2019\u2019 Torres repeats, cutting her off. \u2018\u2018Yes, he was my friend.\u2019\u2019Cabral tries again. \u2018\u2018He was your friend before you \u2014 \u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yes, he was my friend!\u2019\u2019 Torres says, almost yelling. \u2018\u2018You asked the question three times. I done told you.\u2019\u2019Cabral felt that she, too, had been betrayed by Torres. She worried that some of her conversations with him from their Harlem days might have been taped. But soon, in the middle of filming, Cabral would have to choose whether to deceive him in turn.In March 2012, Akili sent a mass email to civil-liberties activists, accusing the F.B.I. of \u2018\u2018harassment.\u2019\u2019 Apparently, some of Torres\u2019s approaches had been clumsily overt. Torres, he says, was constantly asking him about his views on jihad; at one point, he asked him to obtain a gun. Torres, he says, almost forced him to get acquainted with another man, who tried to talk him into traveling abroad and left him with his phone number. Akili says that he typed the number into a search engine and learned that it belonged to an F.B.I. informant.The email found its way to Cabral\u2019s inbox. She was on the road, driving behind Torres. She did not tell Torres about Akili\u2019s suspicions. That night, she and Sutcliffe debated what to do. Akili was most likely under surveillance, and approaching him could tip off the F.B.I. to their presence in Pittsburgh. At the same time, Akili\u2019s voice had the potential to improve the film immeasurably. They decided it was worth the risk. The hardest part would be feigning ignorance with Akili, whose comings and goings they had been indirectly documenting for months. \u2018\u2018We had to strip away everything we knew about this person and reacquaint ourselves with his public self,\u2019\u2019 Cabral said.On camera, in the living room of his public-housing apartment, Akili comes across as an eccentric autodidact, barefoot, turbaned, plump and pale. As he speaks solemnly about the \u2018\u2018greatest jihad\u2019\u2019 being the overcoming of a person\u2019s \u2018\u2018lower, bestial desires\u2019\u2019 through Islam, the camera makes note of his video games and a glittering medallion on his wall. For someone who believes that he is being unjustly hunted by the F.B.I., he is serene and oddly self-possessed. But three days after Cabral and Sutcliffe interview Akili at his apartment, the F.B.I. hauls him away in handcuffs. Akili pleads with Sutcliffe, who was filming the scene, to get help for his wife.At a detention hearing the next day, an F.B.I. agent made Akili out to be a serious threat. He referred to, but never quoted, a taped conversation about \u2018\u2018developing somebody to possibly strap a bomb on themselves.\u2019\u2019 He affirmed that the source \u2018\u2018indicated that the defendant wanted to hook up with the Taliban.\u2019\u2019But these accusations were left out of the indictment. Instead of charging Akili with terrorism, the government indicted him over an image and a seven-second video from July 2010, more than a year before he met Torres. The video shows Akili shooting a friend\u2019s .22-caliber rifle at a gun range, which was illegal because of his previous convictions. Akili pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to nearly eight years in prison, and his wife and their daughter returned to Britain. \u2018\u2018Khalifah al-Akili possessed and fired a rifle after accruing multiple convictions for violent felonies and drug-trafficking offenses,\u2019\u2019 said David Hickton, a United States attorney whose office prosecuted the case. \u2018\u2018His 94-month prison sentence is appropriate to his actions.\u2019\u2019Torres\u2019s mission, to find Akili\u2019s inner terrorist, ends in failure. In the film, he turns on the F.B.I. and all but proclaims Akili\u2019s innocence. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re trying to make me force this dude into saying something to support terrorism,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s not even a pseudoterrorist. .\u2009.\u2009. I said: \u2018What y\u2019all been doing for the last three years? Y\u2019all seen nothing? If y\u2019all seen nothing, then what you expect me to see?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Near the end of \u2018\u2018(T)error,\u2019\u2019 the camera finds Torres in a state of stoned melancholy, angrily soliloquizing on the purposelessness of his work and the stupidity of his superiors. In exchange for their money, he has traded away his identity. Sitting in his bathrobe, he lights a joint, emits a long, jagged cough and pities what he has become. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m trying to be a good [expletive] citizen. Look what happened.\u2019\u2019When Torres and I met upstate, he complained that Cabral and Sutcliffe should have warned him before they reached out to Akili. \u2018\u2018They double-sworded me now, do you know what I mean?\u2019\u2019 He shifted to a discourse on the \u2018\u2018just\u2019\u2019 lie and the \u2018\u2018unjust\u2019\u2019 lie, how a lie is morally defensible if it prevents harm to innocents.So was the lie of Cabral and Sutcliffe a just lie or an unjust lie?\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not going to say it was just or unjust,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They didn\u2019t look at it the way I look at it.\u2019\u2019He wasn\u2019t happy with the filmmakers\u2019 decision, but neither was he ready to call them out on it. Cabral may have captured more of Torres\u2019s double life than he had ever intended to show her. He didn\u2019t seem to fault her for it. It may simply have been a case of his respecting the next thief.Advertisement"}

The totals provide something of a psychological, as well as a financial, boost for Mr. Sanders and his supporters as he seeks to defeat Mrs. Clinton in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton raised $15 million in January, while Mr. Sanders raised $20 million. Mrs. Clinton also raised another $5 million in joint efforts with the Democratic National Committee. But while that money will aid Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the nominee, it is unavailable to her during the nominating battle. While full details will not be available until both candidates file quarterly fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission in April, the advantage for Mr. Sanders underscores how the fiery liberal senator has rewritten the rules of large-scale presidential fund-raising. Virtually all of his cash has come from grass-roots donors giving less than $200, whereas Mrs. Clinton has assembled a more traditional fund-raising operation that relies more heavily on wealthy \u201cbundlers\u201d and donors giving the maximum of $2,700. Mr. Sanders has now raised more money in total than any candidate except Mrs. Clinton herself.

{"Headline": "John Kasich Draws Some Fans Who Might Not Help Him Much: Democrats", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "PLAISTOW, N.H. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio needs every vote he can get to post a strong showing in the Republican primary here, crowded as it is with other so-called establishment governors, like himself, and the outsize popularity of Donald J. Trump.But he appears to be drawing some enthusiastic supporters who may not ultimately prove very useful on Tuesday: Democrats who see him as the best bet in a Republican  field they think is too extreme.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peter Brumis, 71, a registered Democrat who attended a town-hall-style event Mr. Kasich held here on Monday. Registered members of one party cannot vote in another party\u2019s primary, so Mr. Brumis, a retired teacher who lives in Atkinson, N.H., said he was planning to vote for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. But he said that he would vote for Mr. Kasich if he could.These voters have popped up elsewhere in the state, like at another town-hall-style event last Thursday, when a  Democrat took one of Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign signs home with her, hoping she could at least persuade her neighbors to vote for him.Mr. Kasich has some qualities that appeal to liberal voters: He expanded Medicaid in Ohio, over the objections of Republican legislators, and he often speaks passionately on the trail of the need to help the poor and drug-addicted. He has made fun of hard-right proposals like abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. But he opposes abortion except in limited cases, supports the death penalty and frequently boasts of his budget-cutting efforts. A near-constant presence at Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events is a clock that shows the national debt ticking ever upward.So when, on Monday, a reporter suggested he was \u201cDemocrats\u2019 favorite Republican\u201d and asked how he could \u201cthread the needle\u201d to appeal to more conservative Republicans, his response was curt.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with you, is how we thread that needle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said, and climbed into his campaign bus. At Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next stop, in Windham, a sign was stuck in the snow: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats for Kasich.\u00e2\u0080\u009dChuck Angelopulos, 76, had it printed in Massachusetts, where he lives, and brought it to New Hampshire in the hopes of swaying liberal-minded voters to Mr. Kasich. Independent voters can vote in either party\u2019s primary.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better off having this guy in the event that a Republican wins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Angelopulos, who said he was a Democrat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis guy is the best shot we have of having things get done.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven if Mr. Kasich is not promoting his support among some Democrats, his appeal to them could be a sign that a large number of independents will cast ballots for him in New Hampshire on Tuesday.Some of those voters, interviewed at his campaign events last week, said they planned to do just that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like an insurance policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bruce McCracken, 66, a retired educator from Wolfeboro, who attended Mr. Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall in Alton. Mr. McCracken said he was leaning toward supporting Mr. Kasich in the primary, even though he would most likely vote for a Democrat in the general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Democrats don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win, the Republican\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to win. Which Republican do you want to be running the country?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McCracken said.Bob Longabaugh, 85, of Alton Bay, N.H., who was deciding between Mr. Kasich and Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, said he was considering supporting Mr. Kasich for the same reason: If a Republican were to win in November, he would like it to be the Ohio governor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most moderate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Longabaugh said.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Debate Was Display of Strengths, but It Is Unlikely to Change Minds", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "The latest Democratic presidential debate exposed almost nothing that was genuinely new between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet both were loaded for bear. Mr. Sanders was newly aggressive against Mrs. Clinton, accusing her of a \u00e2\u0080\u009clow blow\u00e2\u0080\u009d for saying he has been overly critical of President Obama. Mrs. Clinton, seemingly mindful of her voice level after criticism that she had been shouting during the last debate, rapped Mr. Sanders as unrealistic in the types of health care plans he is putting forward. And Mr. Sanders seemed to tread on thin ice when saying he would be better at soothing race relations than Mr. Obama.As in previous debates, Mrs. Clinton was at her strongest on foreign policy and her weakest in defending things like the \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d that supports her. She tried to hold the group, which is run by a former aide, at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length, and awkwardly. Mr. Sanders was, as he has been, strongest on income inequality and bleak on foreign policy, repeatedly reverting to the same line about how he had opposed the war in Iraq and Mrs. Clinton had not, in a fashion not precisely similar to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the last Republican debate, but not totally different, either. But Mr. Sanders has improved drastically in a brief period in these debates. He was strongest when he deflected the question about Mr. Obama, asking Mrs. Clinton whether she had ever disagreed with a president. Mrs. Clinton was at her strongest at the very end in her closing statement, with a new line that she is almost certain to use in the future: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not think we live in a single-issue country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How much this changes the contours of the race heading into the Nevada caucuses and the South Carolina primary is unclear. But Mrs. Clinton needed to show she could get off the mat after her New Hampshire loss, and she achieved that. Now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto the Republican debate this weekend, at which Donald J.

{"Headline": "After 25 Years of U.S. Role in Iraq, Scars Are Too Stubborn to Fade", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byBaghdad JournalBAGHDAD \u2014 It was once a well-kept memorial for hundreds of Iraqi civilians who were killed by American bombs while they slept, a powerful symbol of suffering embraced by a dictator\u2019s propaganda machine.The destruction of the Amiriya bomb shelter, in a middle-class Baghdad neighborhood, on Feb. 13, 1991, at the outset of the Persian Gulf war, killed some 408 civilians in the worst way possible: Most were burned alive. It stands as the deadliest episode of civilian casualties in the painful history, now a quarter-century long, of the United States in Iraq.This week, 25 years later, the anniversary passed with almost no notice. An Iraqi Army unit now occupies the grounds of the shelter. The site is no longer open to the public, although the occasional survivors or family members of the dead are welcomed by soldiers and given tours.A few days ago, on the anniversary, two men from the neighborhood, now in their 60s, greeted a reporter and spoke about their memories. Each had lost several family members in the attack, and each had helped pile the charred bodies on trucks.One of the men, Hussein Abdella, 63, a retired truck driver, pointed to the neglected gravestones, chipped and overgrown with weeds and wildflowers, and said: \u201cThese are just names. There are no bodies buried here. They were all burnt. You could not recognize the bodies.\u201dShorn of its political purpose, the building itself is now a sad and neglected time capsule. The structure remains just as the American bunker-busting bombs left it, a scar on a cityscape that remains disfigured, too, by strikes from the opening of the 2003 war. There is a giant hole in the roof, a giant crater in the earth and a gnarled mess of wires and protruding steel rods.In dark corners down below are the dusty remnants of what the place once meant \u2014 and still does to some degree \u2014 to the Iraqi nation: black-and-white photos of the victims, arranged by family, fastened to poster boards but no longer hanging from the walls.Many of those pictured are small children: Hussein Alaa Ibrahim and his sister, Samah; Faras Khadim Abbas and his brother Amjid; Karrar Talib and his sister Hadeel.There is a tattered poster from the second anniversary of the bombing, bearing Mr. Hussein\u2019s face and the words, \u201cAllegiance and Challenge: The Second Anniversary of the Immortal Mother of Battles.\u201dFor the two neighborhood men, the anniversary of the shelter bombing was an occasion for reflection on a stark milestone: The gulf war began in January 1991, and so by now the United States has been using its military to shape events in Iraq for more than a quarter-century. And there is no end in sight: The next American president will almost surely be the fifth in succession to order airstrikes in Iraq.There have been many rationales: driving Mr. Hussein\u2019s army from Kuwait; containing his unconventional-weapons programs; protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south; undertaking a full-scale invasion and occupation to depose Mr. Hussein and establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East; and now, fighting the militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.And there have been many enemies: the Iraqi state, Shiite militias, Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic State.Muhammed Jamal, 60, a retired teacher, likened the long American entanglement in Iraq to a television series, absorbed one episode after another.\u201cI am afraid for what comes next,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the future will be even worse. Maybe America will create something new that will be even worse than now.\u201dIn considering the American legacy here, Iraqis weigh the benefits of being relieved of a cruel dictator against the seemingly unending costs, in destruction and death. For many Iraqis it seems a saga without end, especially now, as they see images on their television screens of the near-complete destruction of Ramadi, a city in western Anbar Province from which the Islamic State was recently driven by American airstrikes and Iraqi ground forces.\u201cWe had been Sunni and Shiite living together, and they divided us,\u201d Mr. Jamal said about the 2003 invasion. \u201cThey divided the people. They destroyed the cities.\u201dMr. Abdella recalled the euphoria of 2003, when many Iraqis greeted the Americans as liberators and were grateful to see Mr. Hussein\u2019s demise. Iraqis, only half-jokingly, said they expected their country to become the 51st state.Now, though, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost our hope with the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our experience, over 25 years, from 1991 until now.\u201dMost of the victims of the Amiriya shelter bombing were Sunnis, the sect that held power under Mr. Hussein. That the anniversary has been uncelebrated in recent times is a source of grievance to Sunnis, who believe their suffering does not matter to the Shiite-led government.Col. Faras Hassan, in charge of the Iraqi Army unit at the shelter, had a simpler explanation: \u201cIraqi blood is very cheap.\u201dThe anniversary was recalled in smaller ways, though, in online writings and in emotional postings on social media.One writer, a man named Ali Hashim, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe used to remember this crime before the invasion, but now it has been forgotten because of the daily massacres and killing. May God bless Iraq\u2019s martyrs.\u201dAlso on Facebook, Lamees al-Joubouri wrote: \u201cI still remember that day as I remember how much we cried when we saw the charred, dead people. America has destroyed us, and is continuing to destroy us. May God take revenge for us.\u201dIn the aftermath of the 1991 bombing, as images of the civilian catastrophe were broadcast to the world by the few foreign correspondents in Baghdad, the Pentagon initially defended the attack, saying intelligence showed the bunker was a command-and-control center for the Iraqi Army. There were reports that Mr. Hussein himself had visited the shelter.Later the episode was determined to have been a tragic mistake; Mr. Hussein was not using civilians as human shields, as had been alleged. It was also not an important military facility, though some Iraqi intelligence officials had been there. \u201cIt was clear that the bombing of the facility was an intelligence failure,\u201d Michael R. Gordon, a New York Times reporter, and Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine Corps general, wrote in their book, \u201cThe Generals\u2019 War: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf.\u201dOne of the soldiers now stationed at the site, Taiseer Mahdi, 31, has become the unofficial tour guide for the few people these days who come to see the bunker. He remembers the event, from when he was a young boy, and he said his father had told him the whole story.\u201cI want to serve the families,\u201d he said, speaking of the survivors he has met.As a soldier, he has had his share of encounters with Americans, having trained side by side with them.

Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.There will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public\u2019s collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what\u2019s to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?Apple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.Apple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple\u2019s public opposition to the government\u2019s request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.You can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government\u2019s reach.That\u2019s not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201dOne relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201creasonable assistance\u201d will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.In other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes\u00ad.com; Twitter:@fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kalamazoo Searches for Motive in Spree That Killed 6", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byKALAMAZOO, Mich. \u2014 The shootings came out of nowhere, one after the other, and with no apparent connection.The authorities said a single gunman, Jason B. Dalton, a driver for Uber, was responsible for the night of terror, and investigators were looking into reports that he was ferrying his passengers before the attacks began and perhaps even in between some of the shootings.One customer said Mr. Dalton took him on a harrowing ride around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, less than two hours before the shootings. Another said Mr. Dalton agreed to provide her a ride late Saturday, after the attacks were over.The explosion of violence here left the authorities trying to piece together what might have prompted someone to roam in search of victims.In all, six people were killed and two injured at three shooting scenes across Kalamazoo County, in southwest Michigan between Detroit and Chicago. The victims ranged in age from 14 to 74.Mr. Dalton, 45, a former insurance company employee, was arrested without incident in the parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar about six hours after the rampage began.\u201cThere\u2019s this sense of loss, there\u2019s this anger, there\u2019s fear, there\u2019s all these emotions,\u201d Jeffrey Getting, the Kalamazoo County prosecutor, said at a news conference early on Sunday. \u201cYou put on top of that: How do you go and tell the families of these victims that they weren\u2019t targeted for any reason than they were there to be a target?\u201dOver the past year, the country has experienced a series of mass shootings \u2014 including ones at a church in Charleston, S.C.; at a community college in Oregon; and at a county government gathering in San Bernardino, Calif., which was later declared an act of terrorism. President Obama has repeatedly called for the nation to take steps to curb gun violence and carry out stricter background checks.The authorities here did not immediately provide a motive for the rampage. \u201cThere is some information out there about what was happening\u201d in the suspect\u2019s life, Mr. Getting said. \u201cYou know, of course, it doesn\u2019t come anywhere near to explain what he\u2019s done.\u201dMr. Dalton, who was in custody on Sunday and was expected to face formal charges as early as Monday, had no criminal record. Neighbors described him as quiet and polite, though he caught their attention when he occasionally shot a gun out the back door of the house he shared with his wife and two children. He had worked for Progressive Insurance until mid-2011.According to one passenger, he started working as an Uber driver recently. The passenger, Sara Reynolds, 25, said Mr. Dalton drove her and a friend to a movie theater on Feb. 14 so they could see \u201cDeadpool.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Reynolds recounted how Mr. Dalton had told her that he and his son had also seen the movie. But he also told Ms. Reynolds, unsolicited, that he was a new driver for Uber and that he had quickly picked up poor marks.\u201cHe had just started doing Uber as a driver a day or two ago and that he had already gotten some bad reviews, which was a little weird, so I asked him about it,\u201d Ms. Reynolds said. \u201cAnd he said it was just drunk kids and his car messing up a little bit.\u201d\u201cI could tell that he didn\u2019t really want to talk about it anymore,\u201d said Ms. Reynolds, who described Mr. Dalton as \u201ca little shy and awkward, but he was pretty normal for the most part.\u201d Ms. Reynolds said she had no complaints about his driving that night.An Uber official who declined to be identified because of the continuing investigation said Mr. Dalton had passed a company background check.Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer for Uber, said the company was \u201creaching out to police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.\u201d\u201cOur hearts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this devastating crime and those recovering from injuries,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Another Uber passenger, Matt Mellen, said in an interview with WWMT-TV that a driver who appeared to be Mr. Dalton picked him up late Saturday afternoon, and that the man had driven erratically, speeding through the streets, ignoring a stop sign and swerving through traffic.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop,\u201d Mr. Mellen said. \u201cHe just kind of kept looking at me like, \u2018Don\u2019t you want to get to your friend\u2019s house?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018I want to get there alive.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Mellen said he had left the vehicle as quickly as he could.He later told his fianc\u00e9e what had happened, and she posted a warning on Facebook around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and said they had called 911. He said he also contacted Uber about the ride.Shortly before 6 p.m., in a quiet suburban community northeast of Kalamazoo, shots rang out. James George, 17, said he had looked out the window to see a vehicle speeding away and a woman, wounded, sitting in the parking lot of the development. At least five bullet holes peppered the side of one rental townhouse. The woman, whom the authorities did not publicly identify, remained hospitalized on Sunday evening.About four hours later, at a Seelye Ford and Kia car dealership in Kalamazoo, there were more shots. Tyler Smith and his father, Richard Smith, 53, were killed, the authorities said.Then, in a matter of minutes, five others were shot as they sat in two cars \u2014 parked beside each other \u2014 at a Cracker Barrel in an isolated area near an exit ramp from an interstate highway. Bullet holes were left in a windshield and the car windows.Four women died of multiple gunshot wounds, the medical examiner\u2019s office said. They were identified as Mary Jo Nye, 60; Dorothy Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Mary Lou Nye, 62. A 14-year-old girl, part of the group, was in critical condition at a hospital.In a nearby mobile home park, Chris Juenemann said she had been watching television when she heard five bangs, which she immediately recognized as gunshots. \u201cIt was just so loud,\u201d she said.Ms. Juenemann, whose family has lived there for 17 years, said that the restaurant was always busy, and that serious crime was rare. She said dozens of emergency vehicles soon arrived.More than two hours later, Mr. Dalton was arrested. Officers from the Department of Public Safety and deputies from the Kalamazoo Sheriff\u2019s Department spotted the suspect\u2019s car in downtown Kalamazoo Sunday morning and pulled him over and arrested him, the authorities said. No shots were fired.A semiautomatic handgun was found in his vehicle, and the authorities said it appeared to match the evidence from the shootings. Investigators said Mr. Dalton had been in touch with more than one person over the course of the evening, and they were examining his cellphone for more evidence.\u201cWe are very confident that we have the right person in custody,\u201d said Mr. Getting, the prosecutor.In the rural area outside the city where Mr. Dalton lived, police searched his brown, one-story home on Sunday morning. Sally Pardo, a retired nurse who lived across the street from him and his family, said she and her husband had always thought of Mr. Dalton as a \u201cnice guy\u201d who worked on cars in his spare time. But he used guns in a troubling manner and sometimes sounded a little paranoid, she said.\u201cHe periodically shot his gun out the back door,\u201d Ms. Pardo said. \u201cHe would shoot randomly into the air.\u201dJames Block, 53, who said he had lived next door to Mr. Dalton for about 15 years, said he was \u201cwell-mannered\u201d and pleasant. Mr. Block noted that Mr. Dalton bought a guard dog about a year ago after an apparent burglary, and said he had spoken of concerns about people passing through his backyard.Less than an hour after the shootings ended, Mr. Dalton agreed to pick up a couple at a local pub, according to Carmen Morren, who said she and her boyfriend had agreed to the ride around 11 p.m.Minutes before the pickup, though, the couple \u2014 unaware of the shootings \u2014 happened to change their plans and rode with a different Uber driver.\u201cBy the grace of God, we ended up canceling the Uber that we had,\u201d said Ms. Morren, who provided a screenshot that showed Mr. Dalton had been the driver for a trip that had been scrapped. \u201cWe lucked out on that one.\u201dMitch Smith reported from Kalamazoo, Monica Davey from Chicago, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

Trump is well ahead on the Republican side, while the rest of the field is a muddled jumble for second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth place. What is more, a large portion of the likely Republican primary electorate appears ready to make a late decision. With all that in mind, the final hours are significant. So it was that Mr. Trump was holding one of his rare traditional retail campaign stops at a diner in Manchester on Sunday morning, before heading to a rally. Instead of using his trademark bravado, Mr. Trump sounded a more sober note after the Republican debate on Saturday and throughout the next day. Asked if he would make any bold predictions of victory, Mr. Trump replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, no. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that too much, too long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump, who has seemed to be feeling the rigors of the campaign trail this weekend just as he did in the final weekend before the Iowa caucuses, will hold his first four-event day on Monday.

It is clear that Mr. Rubio had a bad night, but it is far less clear who, if anyone, will benefit. Jeb Bush may have no clear path to the nomination right now, but he had some of his biggest crowds to date on Sunday. Then again, Mr. Rubio also had big crowds. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has been seen to be doing well and vying for second place, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has been trying to capitalize on his rout of Mr. Rubio with a victory lap about how much he enjoyed it. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is hoping not to finish too far behind in a state that was never going to favor him.

{"Headline": "Twitter Steps Up Efforts to Thwart Terrorists\u2019 Tweets", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byFor years, Twitter has positioned itself as a \u201cglobal town square\u201d that is open to discourse from all. And for years, extremist groups like the Islamic State have taken advantage of that stance, using Twitter as a place to spread their messages.Twitter on Friday made clear that it was stepping up its fight to stem that tide. The social media company said it had suspended 125,000 Twitter accounts associated with extremism since the middle of 2015, the first time it has publicized the number of accounts it has suspended. Twitter also said it had expanded the teams that review reports of accounts connected to extremism, to remove the accounts more quickly.\u201cTwitter works as a way to sell books, as a way to promote movies, and it works as a way to crowdsource terrorism \u2014 to sell murder,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a news conference in New York in December.Twitter appears to be heavily used by ISIS \u2014 so much so that some Twitter accounts linked to the group half-jokingly put the location on their profile as \u201cWilayat Twitter,\u201d or \u201cthe province of Twitter.\u201d When recruiting new members begins to get more serious, ISIS members tend to shift to encrypted messaging services like Telegram, Signal and Surespot, which are less susceptible to being intercepted by intelligence agencies like the F.B.I.The number of suspended Twitter accounts related to extremists is a small fraction of the total number of accounts on the service, which has 320 million monthly active users.Still, the 125,000 suspensions stemming from concerns about terrorist activity is significantly higher than previous studies have suggested \u2014 one study released by the Brookings Institution last year estimated that between September and December 2014, at least 46,000 Twitter accounts were used by ISIS supporters. The 125,000 suspensions could include users who have continued creating new accounts after previous ones are suspended, a common practice among ISIS supporters, experts said.A senior Obama administration official said Friday that the White House supported Twitter\u2019s efforts against extremism. \u201cThe administration is committed to taking every action possible to confront and interdict terrorist activities wherever they may occur, including in cyberspace, and we welcome constructive steps from our private sector partners,\u201d the official said.\u201cTwitter has ramped up its response significantly since June 2014, and again since the Paris attacks, but ISIS has still maintained a notable presence on the platform,\u201d said J. M. Berger, a fellow with George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism and author of books on extremist issues. He added that Facebook, the biggest social network, has also \u201cbeen very aggressive on this issue, about as much as anyone could reasonably expect, but we still see some ISIS activity.\u201dTwitter\u2019s disclosure of the number of terrorist account suspensions sets it apart from its social media peers. Facebook regularly discloses the number of government requests it has received for content takedowns on its service, but the company does not break out the removal of terror-related content. YouTube has given more than 200 outside organizations the ability to flag potentially harmful content, which YouTube can then review and remove from the service if it deems the content inappropriate.Because Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have enormous amounts of user-generated content flowing through their platforms on a minute-by-minute basis, the companies rely primarily on users to report objectionable material. On Twitter, people can flag and report posts to Twitter staff members around the world, who review the material and determine whether or not it should remain on the site.But these companies must walk a fine line between bearing responsibility for their platforms and avoiding becoming the arbiter of what constitutes free speech. Experts said that content related to extremism, in particular, was difficult to parse outside of acts of extreme violence.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you won\u2019t accept a beheading video on a site,\u201d said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cBut once you get beyond something that clear, how do you define terrorist content?\u201dMs. Patel noted that these accounts, left untouched, may be of value to law enforcement officials and scholars trying to study extremist online recruitment methodologies. The question of whether or not to suspend every extremist account immediately, she said, is not so cut and dried.Twitter acknowledged that the issue remained tricky.\u201cAs an open platform for expression, we have always sought to strike a balance between the enforcement of our own Twitter rules covering prohibited behaviors, the legitimate needs of law enforcement and the ability of users to share their views freely,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere is no magic algorithm for identifying terrorist content on the Internet, so global online platforms are forced to make challenging judgment calls based on very limited information and guidance.\u201dRukmini Callimachi and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueMost companies say they want to attract a diverse workforce, but few deliver. The only solution may be a radical one: anonymity.Supported byGapJumpers was already working from the insight that, like musicians, coders created something that could easily be evaluated by their peers. But Iyer realized from the study that employers didn\u2019t need to see prospective employees\u2019 faces, or even learn their names. Eventually, they would have to meet, but by keeping the process blind for as long as possible, Iyer figured he could help reduce bias. And, besides, he was already working with the best tool for masking identity in the history of humankind: software.Google likes to hire people who possess something it calls Googleyness, an amorphous measure of how well they will fit in. It\u2019s not easily defined, but it includes things like enjoying fun and \u2014 appropriately \u2014 coping well with ambiguity. This emphasis on \u2018\u2018culture fit\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t unique to Google; it seems to have spread across industries as work hours have lengthened and eaten into our leisure time, and as offices, especially in the valley, have further blurred the distinction between work and leisure. What a candidate might be like in a conference room at 10 a.m. has become almost as important as what he\u2019d be like playing Ping-Pong after a few beers from the office kegerator.\u2018\u2018The pipeline argument can be wiped out with basic statistics,\u2019\u2019 Beasley says. \u2018\u2018The number of people graduating from top schools is just enormous, so you have to think, What could these companies do wrong to not get them?\u2019\u2019One answer is that companies rely too much on flawed human judgment when they recruit. Despite the digitization of job listings, human-resources departments have not changed much from the analog days. And, according to decades of research on the topic, humans just aren\u2019t that good at hiring. A study of top banking, law and consulting firms found that similarities in things like leisure activities and personality were the most important factor in their evaluation of candidates. Hiring now resembles choosing a romantic partner more than an employee, says Lauren Rivera, an associate professor of management and sociology at Northwestern and the author of the study.To try to combat these biases, Iyer and his co-founder Petar Vujosevic devised a way to screen job applicants without showing employers any biographical information. GapJumpers and its client create a list of skills required for the job, then design a relevant test that the applicant completes online. The first piece of information the hiring company sees is applicants\u2019 scores, and, based on those, it selects candidates to interview. Only then does it see their names and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.GapJumpers has conducted more than 1,400 auditions for companies like Bloomberg and Dolby Laboratories. According to the company\u2019s numbers, using conventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening, about a fifth of applicants who were not white, male, able-bodied people from elite schools made it to a first-round interview. Using blind auditions, 60 percent did. \u2018\u2018Employers say, \u2018If you can show me your skills in this role, I am willing to interview you, regardless of where you come from, what you look like or who you are,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Iyer says. A new study from Harvard Business School backs up this line of reasoning. It found that when service-sector employers used a job test, they hired workers who tended to stay at the job longer \u2014 indicating that they were a better match. When employers overruled the test results to hire someone for more subjective reasons, the employees were significantly more likely to quit or be fired.GapJumpers is just one of a handful of Silicon Valley start-ups peddling technological fixes for hiring practices. Gild, for example, has proprietary software that finds candidates based on code they have published online and strips out biographical information before recommending them to employers. Textio, a start-up with clients that include Starbucks and Microsoft, scans job listings and highlights language that data have shown to turn off certain candidates. For example, saying a job requires a \u2018\u2018rock star\u2019\u2019 will draw more men than women; saying it requires a \u2018\u2018passion for learning\u2019\u2019 attracts more women than men. Textio\u2019s research has found that while most people dislike corporate jargon \u2014 \u2018\u2018synergy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018push the envelope\u2019\u2019 and so on \u2014 applicants who are not white dislike it even more and are less likely to respond to job listings that use that sort of language.At Google, interviewers now use standardized questions, mostly abandoning the brainteasers, according to Laszlo Bock, its head of people operations \u2014 the Google term for H.R. They stopped asking for SAT scores, a practice that research has shown underestimates the college performance of women and minority students. They have tried to build diversity into the definition of \u2018\u2018Googleyness,\u2019\u2019 like whether someone has taken an interesting life path or solves problems in a different way. Google says it is hiring more black and Latino employees these days, but this increase has yet to affect its diversity numbers.Silicon Valley is in many ways an odd place to be at the forefront of the solution to the problem of corporate homogeneity. Its work force is strikingly uniform: The diversity numbers from Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies look no better than Google\u2019s. But it\u2019s also one of the few industries in which even the biggest companies are young and nimble enough to quickly change the way they do business, and one that desperately needs more qualified workers.Workplace practices that start in Silicon Valley often spread to other industries \u2014 like open office arrangements, and yoga classes. Despite its reputation today, the tech industry could one day become a model for other industries. If so, the American workplace could soon look less like the people who are doing the hiring and more like the people graduating with the skills to join it.Advertisement"}

Even more complex cases, like those that involve a disorder of muscle action in the pelvis, usually respond well to currently available remedies.Chronic constipation can accompany a long list of medical problems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mechanical ones like a stricture or tumor; neurological disorders like Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease or multiple sclerosis; or metabolic conditions like severe low thyroid or low blood levels of magnesium.Constipation can also be a side effect of medications, especially opiates like Percocet and OxyContin, as well as some antidepressants, anticonvulsants and antihistamines.One of the oldest yet most persistent of these unsubstantiated notions is that failure to empty one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bowels each and every day can result in so-called autointoxication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the absorption of poisonous substances produced from partially digested food and food byproducts in the intestines. Through the years, autointoxication has been erroneously blamed for a host of ailments, including high blood pressure, arthritis, atherosclerosis, gall bladder disease, various cancers and skin disorders.Autointoxication is often cited as a reason for the common but mistaken belief that a daily bowel movement is essential to good health. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that food that sits in the intestine leads to the buildup of toxins. The medically accepted definition of constipation is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfewer than three bowel movements a week, or hard, dry and small bowel movements that are painful or difficult to pass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d often resulting in abdominal pain or bloating.Unfortunately, as a college freshman, I met those criteria. An astute physician provided advice that has helped to minimize the problem ever since. She gave me a list of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstipating\u00e2\u0080\u009d foods to avoid \u00e2\u0080\u0093 white rice and other refined grains, unripe bananas, tea, cheese and chocolate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and even more important, foods to eat regularly: beans, whole grain cereals (especially bran) and breads, vegetables, fruits (especially dried fruits) and nuts. Eating more of these and other high-fiber foods can be very effective in curbing constipation. And she recommended drinking a full glass of water before bed to help soften the stool and another after awakening to stimulate my bowel.Following this advice I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had to rely on laxatives, although those medications are associated as well with myths and misconceptions that are important to dispel. One mistaken belief Dr. Wald and others have cited is that long-term use of stimulatory laxatives like senna and bisacodyl (Senokot and Dulcolax, respectively) can impair normal function of the colon and cause dependency on the medication.While it is true that using stimulatory laxatives for many years at more than a dozen times the suggested dosage can damage the colon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nerves and muscles, Dr. Wald and others say that properly designed studies of these laxatives have shown no harm to the colon when they are taken in recommended amounts.Yet many doctors still warn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 inappropriately, Dr. Wald says \u00e2\u0080\u0094 against taking stimulatory laxatives for more than a few days. Indeed, the website FamilyDoctor.org states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen these laxatives are taken for a long time, the bowel can lose its muscle tone and \u00e2\u0080\u0098forget\u00e2\u0080\u0099 how to push the stool out on its own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Best to forget this outdated idea as long as you stick to the recommended dose if you must take these products.Short of potent laxatives, other milder remedies often prove helpful. One is exercise, the more vigorously done the better. Another is to establish a regular bathroom time and respond promptly to the urge to defecate. I am among many who have found that a large cup of hot coffee in the morning is often a very effective stimulus.However, as my ability to prevent constipation has diminished with age, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added two other over-the-counter aids: a daily soluble fiber supplement of psyllium dissolved in juice or water (other fiber products like methyl cellulose, calcium polycarbophil and wheat dextrin can also be effective) and a twice-daily dose of a stool softener, both of which can safely be used indefinitely.However good dietary fiber normally is for maintaining a healthy gut, it can be harmful when the cause of constipation is muscle weakness or a nerve problem, Dr. Wald said. Such patients often do better by eating less fiber and instead taking a secretory drug like lubiprostone (Amitiza) or linaclotide (Linzess) that adds water to the colon and softens the stool.Sometimes, too, standard remedies for chronic constipation are ineffective. None worked for my friend, a New Yorker who suddenly developed an extremely painful problem at age 73 that was finally diagnosed as a failure of her pelvic floor muscles to relax when they are supposed to and allow the stool to pass through. Instead of relaxing, the muscles around the rectum contract. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a learned unconscious act that can be unlearned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Wald explained.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

By 2020, it will make up half. Survey after survey shows that millennials want to work for companies that place a premium on employee welfare, offer flexible scheduling and, above all, bestow a sense of purpose. These priorities are well known and frequently mocked, providing grist for the oft-repeated claim that millennials are lazy, entitled job-hoppers.But it\u2019s important to remember that this generation was shaped by a recession, an unprecedented crush of student debt and a broad decline in the credibility of all kinds of institutions. Stability is an abstract concept to these young workers, so they instead tend to focus on creating a rich, textured life now, rather than planning for a future obscured by uncertainty. How these desires map onto companies like Google and Facebook is clear, given their strong roots in philanthropy and innovation. But the high ranking of national-security employers also speaks, just as clearly, to millennials\u2019 hope to make a difference in the world.Companies that want to attract the best young workers are already finding that they need to accommodate these wishes. The question is whether, when millennials are running things, they will abandon these priorities as youthful indiscretions \u2014 or establish them as the norm. Maybe one day, even the N.S.A. will have nap pods.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Concerns Over Social Media Link to Virginia Girl\u2019s Killing", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byBLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 The arrest of two Virginia Tech students in the abduction and murder of a 13-year-old girl who posted on a Facebook group called Teen Dating and Flirting \u2014 and showed a neighbor girl texts she said she had exchanged with an 18-year-old man \u2014 has set off new concerns about the dangers to young people who seek liaisons on social media.The two students \u2014 David Eisenhauer, 18, of Columbia, Md., and Natalie M. Keepers, 19, of Laurel, Md., both aspiring engineers \u2014 are being held without bond; they made brief court appearances Monday but did not enter pleas. They are charged in the death of Nicole Madison Lovell, 13, a liver transplant recipient who disappeared from her home here last week.The murder has stunned this college community, though Virginia Tech, the site of a 2007 massacre that remains the deadliest shooting by a single gunman in the nation\u2019s history, is no stranger to sorrow and tragedy. And while the authorities have not said what, if any, role social media may have played in the killing, the girl\u2019s electronic communications, and suggestions that she was bullied, have stirred deep concern here.Stacey Snider, a neighbor of Nicole and mother of 8-year-old twins, said one of her daughters had given law enforcement authorities information that may have played a role in the arrests. The girls were playing in the snow with Nicole hours before her disappearance when, they said, she showed one of them texts she had exchanged through Kik, a mobile instant messaging app, with an 18-year-old that included plans for an evening meeting.\u201cShe said that he was 18, but I didn\u2019t think it was real,\u201d one of the twins, Jaydon Snider, who said she had seen the text, said in an interview Monday, in a cul-de-sac near where Nicole lived. \u201cI was like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019\u00a0\u201dIt was not clear whether the 18-year-old was Mr. Eisenhauer. But in Maryland, the arrests of two seemingly promising students have shocked their communities. Friends and neighbors described Nicole as a sweet girl; her two Facebook pages are filled with the usual stuff of a 13-year-old\u2019s life \u2014 posts about pandas, boyfriends and music. But they also say she seemed to be connecting with older boys through social media in a way they found troubling. One neighbor, Sara Demiri, 15, also said older boys on the bus had sometimes bullied Nicole.\u201cMy first thought is that this kid was really too young to have been using Facebook,\u201d said Jenn Burleson Mackay, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who teaches social media use in the Department of Communication. \u201cTo be looking for boyfriends and dating advice on Facebook at age 13 just seems inappropriate.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t like going to school, because she was bullied,\u201d the newspaper quoted Ms. Weeks as saying. She added that her daughter had told her that \u201cgirls were saying she was fat and talking about her scars from her transplant,\u201d which included a tracheotomy scar.At Blacksburg Middle School on Monday, school officials called in counselors for the students, and asked reporters to keep their distance while their community grieved.\u201cAt this point, I know that she\u2019s sick, she\u2019s hurting, she\u2019s probably already into convulsions, her liver is shutting down as we speak,\u201d Mr. Lovell told the station. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m scared to death.\u201dOn Monday, for the second day in a row, Virginia State Police divers searched a pond on the Virginia Tech campus. The State Police confirmed that the divers were searching for evidence in the death of Nicole, at the request of the Blacksburg police, but declined to be more specific or say what was found.Friends of Mr. Eisenhauer\u2019s said on Monday that his social life, at least in high school, centered on seven or eight long-distance runners who hung out together. He took Advanced Placement classes and was not a partyer, said Paul Lyon, a high school classmate and fellow runner. \u201cWe\u2019d go to someone\u2019s house and get out the Xbox and play Halo or something.\u201dOn the Virginia Tech campus, where memories of the 2007 shooting by a student that left 32 people dead remain strong, there was deep dismay yet again.\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously had a lot of tragedy here before,\u201d said Devynn Breen, a junior from northern Maryland who majors in animal and poultry science. \u201cBut it\u2019s just hard to think that one of your fellow Hokies is capable of this.\u201dHawes Spencer reported from Blacksburg, Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "Heirs to 2 Evangelical Empires Take Different Paths Into Political Fray", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byThe excitement among Christian voters has been on display this month in Iowa, which held caucuses Feb. 1, and South Carolina, where Republicans will vote on Saturday and Democrats on Feb. 27. Similar dynamics could prove pivotal as conservative candidates also seek support in the nine other Southern states where Republicans will vote by March 5. The stakes are high for Mr. Falwell, who is not a pastor, and Mr. Graham as they ponder the rewards and perils of creating political identities apart from the ones their fathers forged decades ago.Both men say there is no rivalry between them as they pursue different ways of engaging in politics.\u201cHe\u2019s got to make decisions and do things that he feels God is calling him to do,\u201d Mr. Graham, 63, said of Mr. Falwell, 53. \u201cAnd I have to do things that I feel God is calling me to do.\u201dBut for both, those decisions play out in the shadows of their fathers.\u201cThe Grahams and Falwells across generations have chosen different tactics, but the tactics could be equally influential,\u201d said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron and an author of \u201cThe Bully Pulpit: The Politics of Protestant Clergy.\u201dHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t see Franklin Graham as deeply involved in partisan politics the way Jerry Falwell Jr. is with his endorsement of Trump. But he\u2019s much more active in politics in the broader sense.\u201dThe sons of two of America\u2019s most influential evangelical figures are establishing their own identities, and often take different approaches to faith and politics.Equally surprising to many was the subject of the endorsement. Most evangelical endorsements have gone to other Republican candidates, like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas or Marco Rubio of Florida.Still, when Mr. Falwell, a lawyer, endorsed Mr. Trump, he did it in a way that was reminiscent of his father\u2019s unvarnished and unapologetic approach.Mr. Falwell said he decided to engage with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, in part, because of his father\u2019s decision to support Ronald Reagan, a Republican who had divorced and remarried, over Jimmy Carter, a Democrat whose Baptist faith was central to his political appeal, in 1980.\u201cThe fact that Christians were criticizing my father for supporting a Hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried over a Sunday-school teacher, that did have an impact on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard a lot of Christians saying this time, \u2018Trump\u2019s been divorced and remarried\u2019 and \u2018Cruz is a great Christian\u2019 or \u2018Rubio\u2019s a great Christian.\u2019 It almost sounded like history repeating itself.\u201dHe said he had received requests for endorsements from others but, \u201cThe reason I endorsed Trump was because I feel like our country is at a crossroads.\u201dMuch of the perceived risk associated with Mr. Falwell\u2019s endorsement, which alarmed some Liberty University alumni, is tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business histories, including his marriages, his casino ownership and, according to some critics, his scant and unsophisticated interest in organized religion.Mr. Falwell, who often spoke of Mr. Trump\u2019s candor and record as a businessman, disagreed.\u201cI really believe that anybody on the left or the right that tries to invoke the teachings of Jesus to say they should vote for this candidate or that candidate, I think they\u2019re stretching Scripture,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell people how to vote, but I\u2019m going to encourage them to vote and as they vote, to look at biblical principles and godly principles that these candidates might support,\u201d Mr. Graham said.It also reflects his father\u2019s history of speaking to mass gatherings, though Franklin Graham\u2019s efforts to rouse Christian votes are not meant to approximate the scale of Billy Graham\u2019s religious crusades, which would attract hundreds of thousands of people over a period of days. (The South Carolina Department of Public Safety estimated that 10,000 people attended Franklin Graham\u2019s rally in Columbia on Feb. 9.)Franklin Graham insists the 2016 tour is nonpartisan and consistent with his father\u2019s vision. \u201cI think both parties are corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe our system is corrupt, and there\u2019s got to be a change. And I believe the only way that change can happen is with almighty God.\u201dBut others say there is little question which party is more likely to benefit from Mr. Graham\u2019s tour and how influential a role he could play in turning out conservative voters.\u201cThough he\u2019s just registering voters, he\u2019s got a pretty good idea of how most of those voters are going to vote,\u201d Mr. Falwell said. \u201cI think what he\u2019s doing is a lot more proactive than it may seem.\u201dThis year, with Billy Graham, 97, rarely seen in public, Franklin Graham has chosen to evoke his father\u2019s name and legacy in his speeches outside state capitols.\u201cI believe if my father were my age,\u201d Mr. Graham told a crowd in Tallahassee, Fla., last month, \u201che\u2019d be standing here today doing exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, have been at war against the Colombian state for five decades, one of the word\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longest-running insurgencies. The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions, cost the state many billions of dollars, fractured the nation and destabilized the entire region.But negotiations that began in Havana in 2012 have now brought the possibility of peace into sharper focus than ever. The sides have reached tentative agreements on a range of key issues and set a March 23 deadline for a final deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to me to be important, at the moment of the signatures, in this moment of transition for the guerrillas, that Colombians know who the FARC are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.While presidential administrations sought for years to cast the guerrillas as murderers and drug traffickers driven by bloodlust and greed, the rebels have portrayed themselves as the protectors of the people, the conscience and caretakers of lands and communities that have historically been neglected by the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oligarchs.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have done terrible things like kill people, use unconventional weapons, kidnapped, extorted, divided families,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rios said in a telephone interview. At the same time, he said, the insurgents have also helped parts of the country that were forsaken by the government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remote areas that are home to \u201cpoor farmers without rights\u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by providing teachers, schools, medical services and public works. Last November, for his most recent photos, he flew to a remote area of Choc\u00c3\u00b3 Province in Colombia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northwest, followed by three separate boat rides that carried him deeper into the forest. After a long hike, he finally arrived at a makeshift FARC camp. He spent the next week living and photographing among the insurgency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 57th Front.The guerrillas did not stay in one place for long, moving camps every couple of days and carrying their belongings on their backs.Mr. Rios captured the daily rhythms of this life: rebels setting up their bunks fashioned from wood and camouflage tarps, standing guard on the perimeter of their camps, cooking, bathing in a river, trudging through dense forest.In these photos, the rebels\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expressions are weary and sullen. There is no merriment. Like armed forces everywhere, so much of their work, it seems, is routine and tedious. The only suggestion of recreation is a photograph of a rebel, an AK-47 slung over has back, setting up a shot in a village pool hall. But even that effort seems devoid of fun, a barely successful hedge against boredom.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like they are a bunch of G.I. Joes armed and firing away all the time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rios said.During that week, he also accompanied FARC to a meeting with members of two rural communities in territory controlled by the rebels. The campesinos were concerned that should FARC put down its weapons and demobilize, the communities would be vulnerable to attack by paramilitary forces seeking to settle scores.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t demobilize, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the peace talks, so that you can continue to defend us,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rios recalled.Mr. Rios also heard uncertainty within the ranks of FARC itself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a happiness for the peace talks and for the advances that the negotiations have made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the same time, I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some doubt about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen in their lives after the negotiations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow would the demobilization process work?

{"Headline": "Social Media: Destroyer or Creator?", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOver the last few years we\u2019ve been treated to a number of \u201cFacebook revolutions,\u201d from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the squares of Istanbul, Kiev and Hong Kong, all fueled by social media. But once the smoke cleared, most of these revolutions failed to build any sustainable new political order, in part because as so many voices got amplified, consensus-building became impossible.Question: Does it turn out that social media is better at breaking things than at making things?Recently, an important voice answered this question with a big \u201c yes.\u201d That voice was Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee whose anonymous Facebook page helped to launch the Tahrir Square revolution in early 2011 that toppled President Hosni Mubarak \u2014 but then failed to give birth to a true democratic alternative.In the early 2000s, Arabs were flocking to the web, Ghonim explained: \u201cThirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life.\u201dAnd then in June 2010, he noted, the \u201cInternet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo \u2026 of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. \u2026 I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it \u2018We Are All Khaled Said.\u2019 In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.\u201dSoon Ghonim and his friends used Facebook to crowd-source ideas, and \u201cthe page became the most followed page in the Arab world. \u2026 Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.\u201dGhonim was eventually tracked down in Cairo by Egyptian security services, beaten and then held incommunicado for 11 days. But three days after he was freed, the millions of protesters his Facebook posts helped to galvanize brought down Mubarak\u2019s regime.Alas, the euphoria soon faded, said Ghonim, because \u201cwe failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization.\u201d Social media, he noted, \u201conly amplified\u201d the polarization \u201cby facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.\u201dSupporters of the army and the Islamists used social media to smear each other, while the democratic center, which Ghonim and so many others occupied, was marginalized. Their revolution was stolen by the Muslim Brotherhood and, when it failed, by the army, which then arrested many of the secular youths who first powered the revolution. The army has its own Facebook page to defend itself.\u201cIt was a moment of defeat,\u201d said Ghonim. \u201cI stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened.\u201dHere is what he concluded about social media today: \u201cFirst, we don\u2019t know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people\u2019s biases are now believed and spread among millions of people.\u201d Second, \u201cWe tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else. Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. \u2026 It\u2019s as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.\u201cAnd fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet.\u201dFifth, and most crucial, he said, \u201ctoday, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. \u2026 It\u2019s as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.\u201d\u201cFive years ago,\u201d concluded Ghonim, \u201cI said, \u2018If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet.\u2019 Today I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Click on any one of the articles, and it will come up immediately, with no wait.The sluggishness is due in part to how websites tend to be built \u2014 old and new technologies are often mixed together on a page.But it is also because publishers have filled their pages with more and more widgets that deliver advertising and collect data on their users as media companies try to find ways to make money in a world where ad revenue is quickly shrinking.Google\u2019s approach, called AMP, or Accelerated Mobile Pages, strips out much of that invisible bloat while preserving the look of the web page and most of the ads.Both Internet companies see fast-loading, high-quality content as important to keeping people searching the web and scrolling through their social news feeds.\u201cWe have said for a long time, speed matters,\u201d said Richard Gingras, who heads news products at Google. \u201cThere is very powerful common cause between Google and publishers. It\u2019s crucial to have a healthy, open web.\u201dFor publishers, which are dependent on Google and Facebook for much of their traffic, working with the companies could hold the key to their future customers. Major media companies, including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Vox Media, BuzzFeed, The Guardian and The New York Times, are participating in both projects as they try to figure out how best to increase traffic and find new loyal readers, while also bringing in revenue from the new formats.\u201cWe want to be where our readers are,\u201d said Kimberly Lau, vice president and general manager of The Atlantic\u2019s digital properties.But Facebook has not shared enough information about the Instant Articles viewership for her to have determined if it was worth giving up the extra ads that are forbidden with Instant Articles.\u201cThe assumption is that the better user experience will deliver more for us. But the jury is still out,\u201d she said.Ms. Lau and other publishing executives have high hopes for Google\u2019s approach, which is more open than Facebook\u2019s and allows for more types of ads and more data collection about users.Google worked for months with content publishers, advertising companies and other partners to develop a new open standard for creating mobile web pages that use as little as one-tenth the data of traditional pages and load up to four times faster.From the start, preserving the ads while speeding them up was a priority. That meant bringing in advertising technology companies and pushing them to improve their load times.Outbrain, which offers an ad product used by many news sites that refers readers to articles by other publications, was blocked by Instant Articles, but the company jumped at the chance to retool its technology so it would work with AMP.\u201cGoogle has definitely done a good job of skinnying up the page,\u201d said Matt Crenshaw, Outbrain\u2019s vice president for product marketing.Publishers have generally praised Google\u2019s open approach, and many said the company was responsive to their particular concerns.The Times, for example, relies heavily on digital subscriptions, with close to 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, and has a corporate goal of doubling its digital revenue by 2020. Google worked closely with The Times to track how many articles visitors were viewing and to prompt them to subscribe when they hit their monthly limit of free articles.\u201cThe way that the meter works is really similar to our current mobile experience,\u201d said Kate Harris, The Times\u2019s director of product who oversees mobile platforms and heads the AMP project. \u201cIt\u2019s truly been a company-to-company collaboration. They flew in a bunch of engineers last week, and we were in a room for many hours,\u201d working on final details.Facebook has been working on a subscription option for months, but still has not offered a solution to publishers that rely on that model.Will Cathcart, the Facebook vice president for product management who oversees Instant Articles, said that hundreds of publishers were participating in the project.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really pleased with how it\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing consumers read more, and they are more likely to share articles they read with their friends.\u201dHe said Facebook was working with publishers to solve specific problems like subscriptions and to share more data while also protecting the privacy of its users.Melissa Bell, vice president of growth and analytics at Vox Media, which is using Instant Articles and AMP, said Vox is overhauling the mobile performance of all its sites, which include Vox.com, SB Nation and Curbed.Interactive graphics, for example, can weigh down a page. \u201cWould it be better to have three graphics that are side by side?\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cYou have to think about this with every story you create.\u201dJulia Beizer, director of product at The Washington Post, said that her publication was an eager participant in all of the experiments, including the nascent News app from Apple, which highlights articles from various publishers on the company\u2019s iPhones and iPads.She said Apple News had sent The Post an unexpected surge of new readers to its science, health and food articles. She credits Instant Articles with sending The Post more repeat visitors. And AMP has cut the time it takes to load a Post mobile web page from three seconds or four seconds to just over half a second.Not all of The Post\u2019s ads transfer properly to the other platforms, she said, and each project takes up valuable time and resources.

{"Headline": "Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 As Democrats consider Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy for the second time, women are wrestling with a difficult question: whether they have an obligation to get behind someone who is closer than anyone has ever been to becoming the first female president.And with her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, outdrawing her in support among young women, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy has turned into a generational clash, one that erupted this weekend when two feminist icons, Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem, called on young women who supported Mr. Sanders to essentially grow up and get with the program.\u201cWe can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot of you younger women think it\u2019s done,\u201d Ms. Albright said of the broader fight for women\u2019s equality. \u201cIt\u2019s not done. There\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other!\u201dMrs. Clinton, 68, laughed, slowly clapped and took a large sip of her beverage.In an attempt to explain Mrs. Clinton\u2019s struggles with female voters in New Hampshire, where the nation\u2019s first primary will be held Tuesday, Ms. Albright said during an NBC interview on Saturday that women could be judgmental toward one another and that they occasionally forgot how hard someone like Mrs. Clinton had to work to get where she is.Women were expected to help power Mrs. Clinton to the Democratic nomination, but as she struggles to overcome a tough challenge from Mr. Sanders and trails him in New Hampshire polls, her support among them has been surprisingly shaky. Young women, in particular, have been drawn to the septuagenarian socialist from Vermont, and the dynamic has disappointed feminists who dreamed of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s election as a capstone to their long struggle for equality.Ms. Steinem, 81, one of the most famous spokeswomen of the feminist movement, took the sentiment a step further on Friday in an interview with the talk show host Bill Maher. Explaining that women tend to become more active in politics as they become older, she suggested that younger women were backing Mr. Sanders just so they could meet young men.\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Steinem said.Realizing that this was potentially offensive, Mr. Maher recoiled. \u201cOh. Now if I said that, \u2018They\u2019re for Bernie because that\u2019s where the boys are,\u2019 you\u2019d swat me.\u201dBut Ms. Steinem laughed it off, replying, \u201cHow well do you know me?\u201dIn numerous remarks on social media over the weekend, female supporters of Mr. Sanders accused both women of undermining feminism.\u201cShame on Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright for implying that we as women should be voting for a candidate based solely on gender,\u201d Zoe Trimboli, a 23-year-old from Vermont who supports Mr. Sanders and describes herself as a feminist, wrote on Facebook. \u201cI can tell you that shaming me and essentially calling me misinformed and stupid is NOT the way to win my vote.\u201dWith backlash growing, Ms. Steinem issued a retraction on Sunday morning.\u201cIn a case of talk-show Interruptus, I misspoke on the Bill Maher show recently, and apologize for what\u2019s been misinterpreted as implying young women aren\u2019t serious in their politics,\u201d she said in a post on Facebook. \u201cWhether they gravitate to Bernie or Hillary, young women are activist and feminist in greater numbers than ever before.\u201dTo some, the apology rang hollow. \u201cObviously, they are desperate because Hillary\u2019s numbers are falling, so they are really pulling out the heavy artillery,\u201d said Camille Paglia, the author and self-described \u201cdissident feminist,\u201d who supports Mr. Sanders and has been critical of Ms. Steinem before.The numbers do show signs of softness. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist College poll of Democratic voters in New Hampshire last week, 64 percent of women under the age of 45 supported Mr. Sanders, while only 35 percent backed Mrs. Clinton. By contrast, women over 45 backed Mrs. Clinton by nine percentage points.In her 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton played down the history-making nature of her candidacy. But this time, she brings it up regularly. The music at her rallies often rings of women\u2019s empowerment, and she frequently discusses the meaning of being a grandmother.Marion Just, a political science professor at Wellesley College, has seen this happen to Ms. Clinton before. She was struck in 2008 by how young women on campus gravitated to Barack Obama in his hard-fought battle for the Democratic presidential nomination against Mrs. Clinton, an alumna of the all-women school. Now, they are drawn to Mr. Sanders.Ms. Just said that she respected women who looked beyond gender when choosing whom to support, but that she was surprised there had not been more excitement about Mrs. Clinton among younger women.\u201cThe question, I think, is how concerned one is about having a woman elected to the presidency,\u201d Ms. Just, who has taught at Wellesley since 1970, said of young women today. \u201cThis generation has a rather optimistic worldview, which is probably not deserved by the way things have been going for women in this country.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has recruited young female celebrities like Lena Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO show \u201cGirls,\u201d and the singer Demi Lovato to build a following among millennial women.During her debate with Mr. Sanders last week, Mrs. Clinton pushed back against his suggestion that she was part of the \u201cestablishment\u201d by reminding voters that her election would be the end of a long road for women.But even young women who would like to see a female president elected someday do not necessarily want to base their vote on that single factor.\u201cWhile the historic aspect of the first woman president is hugely powerful and important and would set a really powerful image for young boys and girls to look up to, she might not be the right first woman,\u201d said Dana Edell, the executive director of SPARK Movement, a gender justice advocacy group.That feeling was evident at a rally for Mrs. Clinton in Iowa in late January when Jaimee and Matthew Warbasse took their 7-month-old daughter to see the candidate who could make history. Women\u2019s rights were so important to them that they named their child Emmeline, after the British suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst.Still, Ms. Warbasse said she was not sure that she would support Mrs. Clinton, as she also found Mr. Sanders appealing.\u201cWhat pulls me to Hillary is that she\u2019s a woman, and a strong woman at that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s about who is going to beat the Republicans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dorsey said early efforts with Moments were promising, though the company had work to do to refine the experience.Beyond Twitter\u2019s core product, the company\u2019s leaders suggested that room for revenue growth may lie outside of the monthly active users that are the focus of investors.Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, pointed to early success in showing ads to Twitter users who are not logged into the service. The company has also emphasized its \u201ctotal audience\u201d \u2014 that is, the people who see Twitter posts on sites across the Internet, yet do not regularly visit Twitter\u2019s website.Mr. Dorsey also underscored the importance of Periscope, the company\u2019s live video app acquired last year, as an important component of its strategy. On Wednesday, Twitter announced it had promoted Kayvon Beykpour, founder of Periscope, to its executive team.All the work to attract new users is not cheap.

But the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contest, a caucus, will test Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organizational strength, and a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz is increasing its staff there to bolster the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign on the ground, and Mr. Cruz was recently endorsed by the Nevada attorney general.On the Democratic side in Nevada, Hillary Clinton has been fending off a stronger-than-expected challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a state she won in 2008. In an attempt to lower the expectations around Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance, her aides have said that caucuses in Nevada would resemble the ones in Iowa. But Nevada is far less white than Iowa is, and that fact helped the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officials fight for its place in the early-state lineup. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was irritated by the remark, according to a person familiar with his thinking, who also said that irritation had somewhat abated. But Mrs. Clinton is leaving nothing to chance, and in an interview with Jon Ralston that aired on Monday, she brushed her own staff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explanations aside. But there is a lot that can happen between now and Saturday, both in Nevada and in South Carolina.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He earned a degree in mathematics at Harvard before joining Tower Research Capital, where he worked for 15 years, until his death.Ms. Guttman grew up in Manhattan, one of four sisters. Her father was a lawyer at the law firm Proskauer Rose, where she now works as an associate lawyer. The two were married in Manhattan.In many ways, the couple\u2019s story was a tale of two cities, happily united.In the eulogy, Ms. Guttman recounted how the couple\u2019s families fused together and how they shared countless happy Shabbat dinners in their home on the Upper West Side. She described how, despite his demanding job, her husband remained available to his family and became a steadying presence in hers \u2014 \u201cthe rock of my family\u201d \u2014 as they struggled to overcome the loss of her father, Charles Guttman, some years before.Ms. Guttman\u2019s voice was steady as she told the story of her husband\u2019s devotion to their combined family, his professional accomplishments, his anonymous donations to causes he believed in.It did not waver until she mentioned their first meeting. \u201cWhen I met David, I felt something I had never felt before, despite many years of dating,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. \u201cI had an instant connection with and attraction to him. We had the easiest connection. When I was with David, I felt like the most secure person in the world.\u201dShe recounted what she called a \u201cstorybook romance.\u201d\u201cWe were able to travel all over the world together,\u201d Ms. Guttman said. A photo from her Facebook page shows the two in traditional Indian dress at the wedding of one of Mr. Wichs\u2019s colleagues.But her eulogy turned, just as marriage does, on the little things. Just as he always found time to return his family\u2019s calls, he paused to be attentive to her, too, she said. \u201cHe was a giant teddy bear who satisfied my need for enormous affection,\u201d Ms. Guttman said. \u201cHe always snuggled with me as often as he could,\u201d she said, recalling how he would slip back into bed to hug her before leaving for work. She added, \u201cHe loved to take care of me.\u201dWhen Mr. Wichs\u2019s brother, Daniel, took the microphone, he spoke quietly of an exemplary older brother, a \u201cmath genius\u201d who was humble, and when asked how he was would only reply \u201cwith a shy and modest smile, \u2018good, good.\u2019 \u201d And yet he charged headlong into life with contagious happiness and enthusiasm, the brother said. \u201cWhen Rebecca came into his life, she brought him the biggest happiness of all,\u201d he added.\u201cAll David ever wanted was to start a family with her,\u201d he said. Their parents live in Brooklyn, where their mother is a pediatrician in Borough Park. \u201cDavid knew how much joy our family had together,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted. That was his dream.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat a horrible tragedy that this dream cannot be.\u201dMr. Wichs\u2019s friend and colleague at Tower Research Capital, Ravi Sarma, described Mr. Wichs as an upright man who put his needs second to others\u2019 and did not subscribe to the belief that success required the cutthroat behavior that is common to much of the financial world. His success came from his love of math and his ability to connect with others, Mr. Sarma said. Before bidding farewell to the man he called his best friend, he said, \u201cHe adored you, Rebecca.\u201d\u201cThe happiest I ever saw David, and I\u2019ve known him a long time,\u201d he added, \u201cthe happiest I ever saw him was on his wedding day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In keeping with that spirit, the exhibit catalog, a 64-page broadsheet newspaper, costs only $5. Over two million copies will be printed in English, German and Japanese \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so it may take a while before it becomes an expensive collector\u2019s item.Mr. Frank and Mr. Steidl, longtime collaborators, wanted to share the work with the largest possible audience, but the cost of insuring and transporting extremely valuable prints, and the difficulty of getting them from collectors and museums, made a regular traveling exhibit impossible.The exhibit includes images spanning Mr. Frank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career, as well as copies of his books, many printed by Steidl. Visitors can also study enlarged reproductions of Mr. Frank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contact sheets. His films \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which were screened at the university last weekend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are represented through individual frames.The newspaper-style catalog was conceived by Mr. Steidl, edited by Alex R\u00c3\u00bchle and designed by Stefan Dimitrov and Christian T\u00c3\u00b6nsmann of the German newspaper S\u00c3\u00bcddeutsche Zeitung.Relying on a broadsheet led to a catalog quite different from the typical photo book. Instead of a simple introduction, critical essay and images, readers experience a wide selection of interviews, documents and stories about Mr. Frank and his work, combined with an elegant display of 242 photos. Perusing the catalog is akin to sitting down to a sumptuous seven-course dinner accompanied by fine wines and at least two desserts.For less than the cost of a fast-food meal.Among the more unexpected inclusions is a police report from Mr. Frank\u2019s arrest in 1955 in Arkansas for being a suspicious driver with New York license plates. The Swiss-born artist was jailed for speaking with a foreign accent, having a number of cameras and possessing more than one passport in different languages.That experience didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep him off the road. An essay by Jack Kerouac recounts a road trip from New York to Florida with Mr. Frank in April 1958.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI sit in the car amazed to see the photographic artist prowling like a cat, or an angry bear in the grass and roads, shooting whatever he wants to see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow I wished I had a camera of my own, a mad mental camera that could register pictorial shots of the photographic artist himself prowling about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfterward, one person asked a question that is most asked at such affairs: Did Mr. Frank have any advice for photography students?He did, and it was short and graceful: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep your eyes open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Post Revives Debate on Whether Monotheists Worship Same God", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byBeliefsIn December, Larycia Hawkins, an associate professor at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian school near Chicago, posted on Facebook a photograph of herself wearing a hijab, with the caption: \u201cI stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God.\u201dTo judge by the angry response, it would seem that Dr. Hawkins had uttered some radical heresy. Her critics made it sound as if no conscientious Christian could compare her god to Allah, or to the Jewish god whose real name is not to be uttered, but who is referred to as Adonai or Elohim.But the truth is more complicated. The idea that all monotheists, particularly Jews, Christians and Muslims, worship or pray to the same god has some support among religious people of all three traditions. The question has been debated for millenniums, and the issue has never been settled. Far from crossing some well-known theological line, Dr. Hawkins was venturing onto disputed territory where nobody knows the exact boundaries.Most of the time, variations on \u201cWe all pray to the same god\u201d are uttered as feel-good pieties by politicians urging us all to get along. For example, in 2003, President George W. Bush, referring to Muslims and Christians, said that \u201cwe worship the same god.\u201dIt is not that there is no dissent. Conservative Catholics raise their voices whenever Francis uses that kind of language. And Richard D. Land, then a top official of the Southern Baptist Convention, upbraided Mr. Bush at the time. \u201cWe should always remember,\u201d Mr. Land said, \u201cthat he is commander in chief, not theologian in chief.\u201d\u201cWe believe,\u201d the statement begins, \u201cin one sovereign God, eternally existing in three persons: the everlasting Father, his only begotten son, Jesus Christ our lord, and the Holy Spirit, the giver of life.\u201dInsofar as Muslims do not believe that God is a trinity, with a Holy Spirit and Jesus the divine son, it is easy to see how one could argue that the Muslim god is not the Christian god. But not so fast, many theologians say.Miroslav Volf, an evangelical who teaches at Yale Divinity School and is the author of \u201cAllah: A Christian Response,\u201d said that Jews also do not believe in the Trinity but that Christians generally accept that Jews worship the same god.\u201cMuslims believe God is indivisibly singular, and Christians believe God is a Holy Trinity,\u201d Professor Volf said. \u201cAnd Christians believe Jesus is God incarnate; Muslims deny that. But Jews have always and even more strenuously contested both claims, and yet Christians have always as a rule believed Christians worship the same god as the Jews and Jews worship the same god as Christians.\u201dAmos Yong, an evangelical who teaches at Fuller Theological Seminary, near Los Angeles, said that a statement like the one from Dr. Hawkins must be judged in the broader context. Considering the hijab Dr. Hawkins wore in the photograph, it seemed she was taking more of a symbolic stance than making a theological statement.\u201cShe was making an effort to stay in solidarity with Muslims,\u201d Professor Yong said.Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of Britain and now a professor at New York University, suggested that the question is deeply philosophical, and linguistic.\u201cIt\u2019s just a definitional issue,\u201d Rabbi Sacks said. \u201cDo you say Jews, Christians and Muslims worship the same god but worship him in different ways, or do you say that the fact that they worship him in different ways show they worship a different god?\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Rabbi Sacks said, the question does not stop with God, but can also be asked of the Jewish characters mentioned in the New Testament and the Quran.\u201cYou could ask if they claim ancestry from the same Abraham,\u201d Rabbi Sacks said.\u201cIs the Abraham that Jews recognize the one Christians recognize, and the one that Muslims recognize?\u201d he added. \u201cHe is conceived in very different ways.\u201dYahya M. Michot, who teaches Islam at Hartford Seminary, in Connecticut, said that from a Muslim point of view there was no question that there is one god, whom even non-Western traditions point toward.\u201cAs a Muslim,\u201d Professor Michot said, \u201cI believe that all the prophets, from Adam to Muhammad,\u201d including Jesus, \u201cbut also the Buddha and myriads of others we don\u2019t know about,\u201d called on us \u201cto worship the same one God, merciful and compassionate.\u201d\u201cThe people speaking of different gods are sectarian extremists wanting to stir up division among humans and are unfaithful to their own prophets,\u201d Professor Michot added.When well-meaning members of one of the three religions say that all three worship the same god, that statement can carry several different implications.For example, it might mean that monotheism is crucial, while the stories\u2019 details are less important. Or that human knowledge is frail, so none of us should feel too certain of the finer points of our own scriptures. Or that God speaks to people through different narratives, all of which are commensurate in ways we cannot grasp.But Jon D. Levenson of Harvard Divinity School says that this attempt at an inclusive monotheism does not necessarily fit what the religions actually believe.\u201cThere\u2019s the question of, \u2018What has God done in the Scriptures?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Professor Levenson said. \u201cThen you discover these gods are different. The Quran says Jesus did not die on the cross. Well that\u2019s a big blow to Christianity! The Quran says God is only one,\u201d not a trinity. \u201cThat\u2019s a direct hit!\u201dmark.e.oppenheimer@gmail .com; Twitter: markopp1Advertisement"}

But we still have too many people in America living in poverty. It is wrong that 35 percent of African-American children today are living in poverty; 51 percent of young African-Americans who graduated high school are unemployed or underemployed. Brothers and sisters, we can do a lot better than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile some applauded, Mr. Sanders\u2019s greatest support came from Karen Brooker, 56, who single-handedly gave him the shouting and applause he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used to hearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she yelled as Mr. Sanders quietly handed the microphone back to the church\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pastor.Moments earlier, Mr. Jealous, borrowing a line from Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2008 campaign as he introduced Mr. Sanders, also failed to get much applause.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who will say to you, there is a dreamer who is running for president,\u201d Mr. Jealous said, \u201cand his dreams are so big ya\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dream that big.

{"Headline": "New Hampshire Heads Out to Cast Its Vote", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "New Hampshire primaries can be unpredictable, particularly in an election when the occupant in the White House is a lame duck. With independents able to vote in either party, predicting the universe of likely voters is tricky. So the polls heading into Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote are a window, but an opaque one. Donald J. Trump seems poised for a win if the polls are to be believed, but by what margin remains to be seen. Another question is whether his last-minute use of an expletive to describe Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, first used by a woman in the crowd at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final rally on Monday, will sink in with voters.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also seems poised for a win over Hillary Clinton, but again, by what margin is the main question. Mrs. Clinton had seemed to have moved beyond attacking Mr. Sanders, until she used opposition research to say he takes money from big banks, citing a fund-raiser with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mrs. Clinton denied a report about her examining a staff shake-up, but she has struggled to define the central message of her candidacy.The real question on the Republican side is who comes in second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth. After that, the field will winnow.What is certain is that the races are far from over. The Democratic primary had once seemed likely to wrap up after New Hampshire, but it is now almost certain to drag on for many weeks. Mr. Trump may not be the juggernaut he appeared to be in December, having lost Iowa, but if he wins New Hampshire, he will be very much in the quest for the nomination. Months of town-hall-style meetings, rallies and retail stops finally wind down in New Hampshire on Tuesday. From here, the race will head to Nevada and South Carolina.

{"Headline": "Narrow Focus May Aid F.B.I. in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byInstead, the F.B.I. took the industry by surprise and cleverly stopped short of expectations. The bureau asked Apple for something very specific: that it create an alternative operating system for just one phone that would help the government break into the device. The limited nature of the request has helped the government portray this case as a one-time demand, without ramifications beyond the case at hand.While the F.B.I. is pursuing a narrow focus, Apple is arguing its side as broadly as possible.The company has repeatedly said this case is about much more than the iPhone of one of the attackers from a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14. The company has framed the government\u2019s request as a larger discussion of privacy and civil liberties, and a slippery slope that could open the way to similar demands in the future.The differing approaches are set to be the core of each side\u2019s arguments as Apple and the United States government dig in for an extended period of legal wrangling. Both are betting that their narrow-versus-broad lines of reasoning will help them win both in court and in the court of public opinion.For now, while civil liberties groups and many tech companies say they side with Apple, the government may have carved out an advantage by proffering its narrow argument.\u201cBy making its request so targeted, Apple has fewer grounds to argue their side than had the government asked it to permanently change its code,\u201d said Jason Healey, a former White House security policy director and a research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks that Mr. Cook had made.The greatest fear among many privacy and computer security advocates was that the government would try to force Apple to give up the security keys it uses to digitally sign its code, keys that would let government programmers disable Apple\u2019s security.Instead, the F.B.I. understood that Apple can cleanly install new software on broken phones, without replacing them, and asked the company to make a similar tool that would let investigators break into a work phone issued to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.The bureau has taken pains to note that it did not ask Apple to break the password, and that this solution would not work on newer phones.On Sunday, Mr. Comey\u2019s statement to defend why the agency needed to break into the iPhone said that the court order \u201cisn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.\u201dF.B.I. technical specialists have been working with companies to figure out how to extract data from phones for years.A government official said on Monday that investigators quickly realized that in the San Bernardino case, a technical solution was available. \u201cThis was just the logical extension to what we were already doing,\u201d one senior government official said.\u201cI think Apple was hoping that the request that came was more outrageous,\u201d said Dan Guido, the founder of the security firm Trail of Bits. \u201cThe F.B.I. was very adroit. They waited for the perfect situation where they had all these factors aligned so the request looks pretty straightforward.\u201dTo that point, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., criticized Apple after it refused to comply with the court order and said that they currently possessed 175 iPhones that they could not unlock.Charlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.Mr. Vance responded: \u201cAbsolutely right.\u201dEven people who oppose the Justice Department\u2019s request concede the government made a smart first move, one that could establish precedent to justify more invasive tactics.\u201cThey\u2019ll come up with a reason why for every single phone,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former White House security adviser who, while in government, said he opposed this tactic. But as a strategic matter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s tactically brilliant.\u201dSome citizens and politicians have attacked Apple\u2019s decision, like the families of the San Bernardino victims, Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Senators Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins.To gird for the fight, Apple has hired Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Theodore B. Olson, partners at Gibson Dunn, as outside counsel. Both men have a long history of pushing the courts and the public to see the bigger picture on heated issues including gay marriage.But privately, there is talk among these companies that Apple may have overplayed its hand by taking the issue public in an all-out defiant assault against the F.B.I., according to two people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. These people fear the public may eventually sympathize with the F.B.I.\u2019s argument, especially considering the heinous nature of the crimes.Apple proposed in its statement that federal prosecutors de-escalate the situation by withdrawing their demands, and \u201cas some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the government\u2019s strategy in seeking to force Apple to help it open a terrorist\u2019s iPhone misspelled the surname of one of Apple\u2019s outside lawyers. He is Theodore B. Olson, not Olsen.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Matt Apuzzo from Washington. Mike Isaac contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Six Degrees of Separation?

The phrase proposes that between any two strangers there are at most five intermediaries that link them together.So according to Facebook, depending on how you want to do the counting, the true number, referring to intermediaries or to links, is either 3.57 or 4.57 degrees of separation. (Facebook\u2019s post is a little confusing on this point, seeming to use multiple definitions of \u201cdegrees.\u201d)If you are logged into Facebook, the blog post will tell you your average degree of separation \u201cfrom everyone.\u201d The number is an estimate derived from statistical algorithms and not, as it seems, an intrusive estimate of the reach of your friends and family. According to the post, Facebook users in the United States are connected by an average of 3.46 people.It placed my personal degree of connections at 3.2, below average but nowhere close to the reach of Sheryl Sandberg, who, the post says, is separated from everyone by only 2.92 degrees.The six degrees of separation theory has always been more thought experiment than scientific fact. Its invention is often credited to the Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy, who, in 1929, used a short story to consider the fact that \u201cPlanet Earth has never been as tiny as it is now.\u201dIn the philosophical piece, similar in its approach to the work of Jorge Luis Borges and C\u00e9sar Aira, Mr. Karinthy had his characters propose a game of connection, choosing strangers such as a Nobel Prize-winning writer and a worker for the Ford Motor Company and forging lines of acquaintance between themselves and those subjects.\u201cNobody from the group needed more than five links in the chain to reach, just by using the method of acquaintance, any inhabitant of our planet,\u201d he wrote.The playwright John Guare took up the idea in 1990, writing a play titled \u201cSix Degrees of Separation,\u201d which was adapted three years later into a movie of the same name starring Stockard Channing and Will Smith.Released to critical acclaim, the film represented an early version of the crowd-pleasing, everything-is-connected conceit that showed up a decade later in award-winning films like \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201cCrash.\u201dNicholas Christakis, the co-author of \u201cConnected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives,\u201d linked our fascination with recognizing strangers to a biological urge to distinguish friend from foe. He recalled the legends of medieval knights meeting on the road and stopping to recite their lineages.\u201cIf they found that they shared a great-uncle or one of them had been a vassal to a similar king, they would dismount, hug each other and swear loyalty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they found that they had no overlap, they would fight to the death.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Pertussis Is Making a Comeback", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Whooping cough, a potentially life-threatening childhood illness, all but disappeared in the 1940s after a vaccine was developed. Why is it making a comeback now, when most children are vaccinated?In recent years, there have been several outbreaks reaching numbers not seen since the 1950s. A spike in 2012 sickened 48,277 Americans, and 20 died, most of them infants. There were 13 deaths in 2013 and again in 2014, the last year for which statistics are available.The respiratory illness induces such powerful, uncontrollable fits of coughing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the medical term is paroxysmal coughing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that older patients may break a rib or burst capillaries in the eyes. Children may have seizures. Babies, who cannot cough that hard, can stop breathing and die.A recent study from California confirms what earlier reports have suggested: that the newer pertussis vaccine, reformulated to be safer and have fewer side effects than the older version, just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as effective.The study, by researchers at Kaiser Permanente\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, Calif., found that just three years after vaccination with the new vaccine and booster, teenagers had lost virtually all of the vaccine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protection, and more than 90 percent were susceptible to infection. The teenagers had received only the newer form of the pertussis vaccine and booster, a form without whole cells called DTaP, which in the 1990s replaced the previous vaccine, a whole-cell pertussis vaccine called DTwP. (The pertussis vaccine is given in combination with those for diphtheria and tetanus.)These teenagers had the highest incidence of pertussis of any age group in 2014, despite receiving boosters at ages 11 to 12. The booster was introduced in 2005 when health experts realized the new vaccine was not conferring lifelong protection, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.But the study showed that even with the booster, teenagers were still vulnerable to infection.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe levels at which it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occurring now haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been seen in at least 50 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Klein said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest driver is waning immunity from our vaccines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tami Skoff, an epidemiologist with the division of bacterial diseases of the C.D.C. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last as long as we originally thought it would.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite concerns about the effectiveness of the new vaccine, there are no plans to return to the old one. The earlier vaccine carried a high risk of alarming but temporary side effects like pain, swelling at the site of the injection and fever, as well as more serious complications like febrile convulsions or loss of consciousness, said Dr. James D. Cherry, professor of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A., who has written extensively about pertussis. There had also been cases of a brain disorder, encephalopathy, after vaccination.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe older vaccine had some significant downsides; the new one is much better tolerated but may not be providing as robust protection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Wanda Filer, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.That does not mean you should skip vaccinations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the contrary: Experts say vaccinations are more important than ever for children, pregnant women, and adults generally, especially those who will be in close contact with a newborn, such as grandparents, siblings or a nanny.For adults, even if the vaccine does not prevent disease entirely, it reduces the severity.That is important, Ms. Skoff said, because the disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which once killed thousands of Americans each year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be miserable and prolonged. It can last for months and is often called the \u00e2\u0080\u009c100-day cough.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaking a diagnosis is tricky. Even though pertussis is a bacterial respiratory infection that responds to antibiotics, the diagnosis is usually missed early on when the condition is treatable because it is mistaken for a cold or bronchitis. Not all patients exhibit the disease\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characteristic whooping sound when they catch their breath after coughing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very painful disease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Carrie Byington, a professor of pediatrics at University of Utah who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 committee on infectious diseases. She had pertussis herself when she was a young doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like any other cough you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced. Even as an adult, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really control it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly powerful.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA severe infection may require hospitalization, and recovery can take months; the illness can have a lasting effect on lung function, leaving people with shortness of breath or fatigue. Even after a person recovers, another viral respiratory infection can cause pertussislike cough spasms, doctors said.For now, however, the focus is not on developing a more effective vaccine. Instead, public health officials are promoting vaccinations for pregnant women and adults. Some experts have suggested more frequent vaccinations for everyone, timed before an expected outbreak, or every three years.New vaccines \u00e2\u0080\u009care a long ways away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Cherry said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re much better off than we were in the past, and we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t having reactions with vaccines.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Italian-Iranian Hall of Mirrors", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byItaly\u2019s decision to cover up the nudes at the Capitoline Museum in deference to the sensibilities of the visiting Glasgow-educated Iranian president has been widely interpreted as final proof of the capitulation of Western civilization to theocratic Islam.If Italy, inheritor of the glories of the Roman Empire, boxes up some of its finest works of art just in case the eye of President Hassan Rouhani should fall on the plum-like breast of a marble goddess, then nobody should be surprised if Islamic fanatics (Sunni, not Shiite, but still) choose to destroy the glorious Greco-Roman legacy at Palmyra.Or so the reasoning goes.As a consequence of Boxgate, Italy has suffered ridicule. Nothing is worse than ridicule. Here it is merited. Not so much, I would argue, for Italy\u2019s clumsy attempt at courtesy, for courtesy is important and has become an undervalued virtue. Reading the fall of the West into the concealment of a nude is going too far. Mistakes happen.No, the ridicule is merited because the decision to hide the works of art was, it seems, made by nobody. In Rome, the buck stops nowhere.The Capitoline Venus just boxed herself up one night because she was bored and took a few deities along with her.The prime minister, Matteo Renzi, did not know. The foreign minister did not know. The culture minister called the decision \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d They were, they insist (perhaps too much), as surprised as anyone to find all those white cubes \u2014 none, incidentally, provided by the prestigious White Cube gallery in London.One account has it that a woman named Ilva Sapora who works at Palazzo Chigi, where Renzi\u2019s office is located, made the decision after visiting the Capitoline with Iranian Embassy officials. \u201cNonsense,\u201d Jas Gawronski, a former Italian member of the European Parliament, told me. The notion that a midlevel Chigi official in charge of ceremonial matters could have made the decision does seem far-fetched. Gawronski believes it is more likely to have been officials at the Farnesina, home to the Foreign Ministry.One thing can be safely said: Nobody will ever know. I was a correspondent in Rome for some years in the 1980s. Periodically there would be developments in terrorist cases \u2014 the Piazza Fontana bombing of 1969 or the Brescia bombing of 1974. Trials, verdicts, appeals followed one another. Facts grew murkier, not clearer. It would take decades to arrive at convictions that did not resolve doubts. Italy has never had much time for the notion that justice delayed is justice denied.A great country doesn\u2019t have statues that box themselves up all by themselves.Truth in Italy is elastic. A much-conquered country learned the wisdom of ambiguous expression, as for that matter did much-conquered Persia. The Italians say, \u201cSe non \u00e8 vero, \u00e8 ben trovato\u201d \u2014 roughly, if it\u2019s not true it ought to be.The Iranians insist nobody asked for those masterpieces of Classical humanism to be hidden: another case of nobody\u2019s decision.Iran, too, distrusts clarity. It is a nation whose conventions include the charming ceremonial insincerity known as \u201ctaarof\u201d and \u201ctagieh,\u201d which amounts to the sacrifice of truth to higher religious imperative.Needless to say this Holocaust denial is odious, the regime at its worst. It is also a sign of desperation among the hard-liners determined to block Rouhani\u2019s opening to the world. They reckon Holocaust denial will derail any d\u00e9tente. The buzzword of the hard-liners is \u201cnufuz,\u201d or infiltration by the West. Iranians are being warned to guard against it in this month\u2019s parliamentary elections.You can hide a few statues in the Capitoline Museum, but you can\u2019t hide the deep rifts between an Iranian society overwhelmingly in favor of opening to the West and a theocratic regime determined to ensure the nuclear deal does not lead to wider cooperation with the United States and Europe.Far from finding itself in a state of capitulation, the West exerts a very powerful cultural magnetism, evident in the rabid desperation of its opponents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hospitals, Smoke-Free Doesn\u2019t Mean Abuse-Free", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.The substance user and the hospital are bound by the most ambivalent of relationships. Heavy users \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of tobacco, alcohol or harder drugs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 see far more of the wards than the average citizen and, it is safe to say, like them even less.They need hospitals. They hate hospitals. Hospitals make them well and sick at the same time. We are their doctors and nurses, their parents, their arresting officers, parole officers, judge and jury. Needless to say, we are not trained for the last five roles, nor are we particularly good at them.A single principle guides us: You cannot use your drug of choice on our premises, no matter how much you may need it and prefer it to our proffered alternatives. Around that immutable core swirl large clouds of negotiation, compromise, duplicity, manipulation and general misery for all involved.On some days it seems as if we spend all our energies managing not the conditions we are trained to manage but the addictions that complicate them.One patient is tying his shoes as we make our rounds in the morning, and tells us cheerfully that he is going out for a smoke. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be right back. We inform him, not without sympathy, that in our hospital smoking breaks are not allowed. If he leaves for even half an hour he will officially be considered discharged. His bed will be given to someone else, and to resume his medical care, he will have to go back to the emergency room and start the cycle all over again.We propose a nicotine patch instead, but the nurses have already given him a patch, to no effect. Few other compromises are possible between the smoke-free hospital and the hard-core, implacable smoker. The discussion grows heated. We wind up discharging him on the spot, just a little sooner than we had in mind.The patient in the next room has been in the bathroom for almost an hour. We need to examine him. We knock on the bathroom door. He yells out that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine.When he finally drifts out, drowsily readjusting the dressing covering the intravenous line in his arm, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look fine. He looks as high as a kite, and come to think of it, the two visitors lounging by his bed do, too. We sigh. No easy compromises will be possible for him.Still, smokers pose fewer challenges than intravenous drug users, like that young man who wandered out of his bathroom to face our interrogation. He has an infected heart valve, and is receiving high doses of antibiotics through an intravenous line in his arm, a portal to his bloodstream that is apparently proving too tempting for him to ignore.He needs antibiotic treatment, and we have no oral options for him. Among other considerations, if his guests keep providing him with substances to shoot into that line, it may well become infected and unusable, and he will get even sicker than he is.He promises never to do it again.So now what? We have a set of programmed responses, none particularly satisfying or effective.We can give him some methadone to keep him from withdrawing. We can screen his visitors or post a watcher at his bedside. Some hospitals transfer patients like him to an expensive intensive care bed for even more careful monitoring. Some make contracts and threaten to kick patients out for violations. (Can we really kick them out, as desperately sick as they are? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never actually seen that happen.)Instead, we routinely plan for patients to be transferred to drug treatment programs when they are discharged. Quite a few don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last that long. Our patient will prove to be one of them: After a few more days, he will suddenly be gone, well enough to walk out of the hospital (and take his intravenous line with him).Presumably, he will try to make it out in the world until he gets too sick and lands in another hospital, where events will repeat themselves in yet another baffling health care cycle.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "An Eating Disorder in People With Diabetes", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "The first time she skipped an insulin dose, the 22-year-old said, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t planned. She was visiting her grandparents over a summer break from college and indulged in bags of potato chips and fistfuls of candy, but forgot to take the extra insulin that people with Type 1 diabetes, like her, require to keep their blood sugar levels in a normal range.She was already underweight after months of extreme dieting, but when she stepped on the scale the next day, she saw she had dropped several pounds overnight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI put two and two together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young woman, who lives in Boston and wished to remain anonymous.She soon developed a dangerous habit that she used to drive her weight down: She would binge, often consuming an entire pint of Ben & Jerry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peanut butter cup ice cream, and then would deliberately skip the insulin supplements she needed.People with Type 1 diabetes, who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce their own insulin, require continuous treatments with the hormone in order to get glucose from the bloodstream into the cells. When they skip or restrict their insulin, either by failing to take shots or manipulating an insulin pump, it causes sugars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and calories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to spill into the urine, causing rapid weight loss.But the consequences can be fatal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew I was playing with fire, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thinking about my life, just my weight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young woman, who was treated at The Renfrew Center of Boston, which specializes in treating eating disorders, and is in recovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got used to my blood sugars running high all the time. I would get so nauseous I would throw up, which I knew was a serious sign that I should go to the hospital. It was very scary.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe eating disorder the young woman developed is unique to people with Type 1 diabetes and has been called diabulimia, though it is not a recognized medical condition. (People with Type 2 diabetes who take insulin do not have the same rapid response to insulin restriction.) It occurs when patients manipulate their insulin in order to purge calories, much as someone with bulimia might induce vomiting to lose weight.Insulin restriction can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal condition that develops when the body lacks insulin and starts to break down fat, producing ketones that can poison the body. It also increases the risk of serious long-term complications of diabetes, including kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, amputations and heart disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Faustian bargain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Henry Cheng, the Northeast regional medical director for The Renfrew Center.The combination of Type 1 diabetes and an eating disorder is \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ann Goebel-Fabbri, a psychologist in Brookline, Mass., who specializes in treating people with diabetes who have eating disorders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnorexia is the most lethal psychiatric diagnosis that exists, and the risk of mortality is so much more heightened when Type 1 diabetes is added.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTreatment for diabulimia is especially challenging because approaches to managing eating disorders and diabetes are at odds with one another, said Trish Lieberman, the director of nutrition at Renfrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe treatment for diabetes includes very intense focus on reading labels, counting calories and carbohydrates, and limiting sodium and fat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll these things that are very effective for treating diabetes are actually contraindicated for eating disorders, where we try to take a more intuitive approach, saying there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good or bad foods.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIndeed, Dr. Goebel-Fabbri said, the meticulous focus on food in diabetes \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan mimic an eating disorders mind-set.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAn added danger occurs when diabetic patients disengage from their medical care, she said. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happened to the Boston college student, who put off going to the doctor for months at a time, hoping the delays would give her time to change her behavior and improve her blood glucose test results. She was alarmingly underweight, and her friends and family were concerned.Last spring, with severe pain racking her body and fearful she had damaged her kidneys (she had not), she finally enrolled in an intensive five-week day treatment program at Renfrew, followed by a slightly less intensive six-week program.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt that point, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI almost felt like if I were to die, I would deserve it. I was thinking more of my mom. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that to my mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThough she still suffers from obsessive thoughts about food, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a much better place. My weight is at a healthy range. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more comfortable about reaching out when I need help.\u00e2\u0080\u009dExperts say both physicians and family members should be on the lookout for eating disorders in Type 1 diabetes patients who have repeated episodes of ketoacidosis, or consistently poor blood sugar control that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improve. While eating disorders usually develop during the preteen and teenage years, they may emerge later, during college or early adulthood, in those with Type 1 diabetes, experts say.Once patients get help and start recovering, they can regain their health and stave off long-term complications, Dr. Goebel-Fabbri said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so positive, and what people need to hear, is that healing can occur, once blood sugar gets to a healthier range.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Populist Tide Propels Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "For those questioning whether the populist anger that was showing up in polls was being hyped by the news media, the results of the New Hampshire primary demonstrated otherwise. Donald J. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, candidates from very different places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one a plutocrat, the other the son of a Polish immigrant who went to a Brooklyn public school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 captured primary victories in the state. Seven months ago, it would have been hard to conceive of such a result. Mr. Sanders was seen by some as a protest candidate who would not halt the Hillary Clinton march toward the nomination, and Mr. Trump was seen as a circus sideshow whose support was founded solely on name recognition. In Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, he outperformed some of the public opinion polls leading into New Hampshire, a feat for which he deserves credit.The two New Yorkers will catapult out of New Hampshire with the wind at their backs. Mr. Sanders, a prodigious low-dollar fund-raiser, is almost certain to reap a windfall that will fuel his campaign for many months.At her concession event, Mrs. Clinton delivered a different, more cohesive speech, one that sounded determined to move forward for what will be a long slog. While she was aware she would most likely lose in the state, the margin was still large, and she must regroup before the Democratic debate in Milwaukee on Thursday night. Her aides have said they believe her longstanding ties with black voters will aid her in South Carolina \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but there had also been an assumption that her longstanding ties in New Hampshire would help her. The Republican race seems destined to be confused and lacking clarity leading up to the July convention. The question remains as to how Mr. Trump will tailor his effort going forward. It is impractical and difficult to continue running everything on the fly. He has long craved electoral respectability, but the roots of his candidacy can be traced to May 2011, when President Obama, during his address at the White House Correspondents Dinner, put a picture of his Hawaiian birth certificate on a large screen.Mr. Trump, who had insisted that there were questions about Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true birthplace and spent weeks on the issue, sat in the center of the room at the dinner, surrounded by more than 2,000 people, all of whom laughed loudly at Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gag. Mr. Trump sat still, watching from his chair. Five years later, he seems determined not to be humiliated again, and to stop those who laughed at him. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Hospitals Focus on Doing No Harm", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Last week, I reported on the problem of preventable harm in hospitals. It has been estimated that each year between 98,000 and 440,000 people die as a result of preventable errors in hospital. Many readers wrote in with comments about family members who were victims of flawed care. They revealed a sense of betrayal and hurt. How could hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 institutions we turn to for comfort when we are most vulnerable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so often increase pain and suffering?Orlando Health, however, has struggled with surgical site infections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rate was staying flat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Thomas Kelley, chief of quality and clinical transformation for the network. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we dug deeply and created a comprehensive response. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no single magic bullet.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey let surgeons know their own rates of infection and how they compared with those of peers and national benchmarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt had a profound impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kelley. Instead of having to impose changes, he said, surgeons came to him asking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat should I be doing differently?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey began limiting entrances and exits to operating rooms and stopped surgical teams from bringing in backpacks, cellphones or external scrubs; became more careful about the timely administration of antibiotics; paid more attention pre-admission to blood sugar levels, which can increase infection risks even for non-diabetic patients; and began using ultraviolet disinfection in operating rooms. The changes led in 2015 to a 21 percent reduction in surgical site infections, Kelley said.In recent years, the Washington State Hospital Association has also attacked sepsis. Carol Wagner, the senior vice president for patient safety, reports that between 2011 and 2014, state hospitals saw a 36 percent reduction in severe sepsis and septic shock compared with the 2010 rate. The hospital association estimates that this reduction has saved 3,600 lives.Many elderly people have poor sensation in their feet. Better management of diabetes, and exercise, can improve this. Good rubber-soled shoes with closed heels and toes are important, says Quigley. (Tennis shoes are ideal.) Elderly patients often experience a dizzying drop in blood pressure when they stand up. Cutting back on diuretics, giving fluids, or modifying other medications, can help. For stroke patients, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to get out of bed from the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe exit side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gerontologists know these things; but, as with hand washing, the challenge is getting patients, hospital staff and families to remember them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor us, the primary outcome has been reducing injury from falls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Quigley.Read previous contributions to this series.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to report on this issue, so please write in with ideas or personal experiences.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Move in New York, on Bicycles Built for More Than 2", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosThe movers arrived at Barbara Ross\u2019s apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan one Friday last month, grabbing bags of clothes and shoes, framed pictures and boxes of CDs. They carried the items downstairs and loaded them onto four long-framed cargo bicycles parked on Ridge Street.As the number of objects atop the slender frames increased, the bikes brought to mind a train of pack mules preparing for a frontier crossing. Cargo, including a seven-foot-tall wood bookshelf, was cinched with thick canvas straps and crisscrossing bungee cords. Passers-by gazed curiously as the movers helped fit oddly shaped items onto a bike\u2019s cargo platform.When moving from one apartment to another, people in New York City have paid moving companies, loaded packed possessions into cars or rented vans, or even transported boxes and pieces of furniture on the subway.Ms. Ross, 52, a video training manager who had just bought a co-op apartment near Union Square, hired members of the Cargo Bike Collective, a loose-knit group of people who own and ride the extra-long bikes, which they use for both paying jobs and volunteer projects.Ms. Ross, a longtime bicycling advocate who has joined the collective, already knew many of its members. She paid the four who showed up a discounted price of $400 for their help in moving her possessions. The regular price would have been $600, or $150 per hour for a group of four people doing four hours of moving, according to Joe Sharkey, a founding member of the collective.\u201cI have always been a big supporter of bicycles over cars,\u201d Ms. Ross said. \u201cSo if I could find a way to move my apartment using cargo bikes instead of a moving truck, of course I was going to do it.\u201dThe members of the collective transport various objects regularly, Mr. Sharkey said, but they handle apartment moves only about a half-dozen times a year.Members of the collective said that over the years they had used cargo bikes to carry boxes of macaroons, stacks of newspapers, loads of mulch and, once, a cat on its way to Kennedy International Airport. Ryan Backer, 27, said that in 2013 he had transported a five-foot fully stocked freezer.Mr. Sharkey, 34, said the collective functioned as a \u201cfraternal beneficiary society,\u201d and that members were discussing how to form new chapters and provide health insurance to themselves and other members of the bicycling community, including mechanics, couriers and frame fabricators. He said the group also helped people learn how to ride cargo bikes, which can be tricky because of their length and their weight when fully loaded.\u201cIt\u2019s all about balance and momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it helps to be fearless.\u201dOn Ms. Ross\u2019s moving day, the cargo bikes took off at a stately pace, first heading west on Rivington Street, then north on Avenue A and across 15th Street toward her new home. She accompanied them, riding a Worksman tricycle that held items in a wire basket between the two rear wheels.The ride went smoothly, though a bus loomed suddenly at one point behind the bikes like a tall barge moving close to a line of tugboats. At another point, a cargo bike had to swerve to avoid a pedestrian who emerged, head down, from between two parked cars.The members unloaded their bikes outside the building on 15th Street and carried the items upstairs. Then after a short break to drink cans of coconut juice and blow on frozen fingers, they returned to the Lower East Side to start a second run.\u201cI used to drive a Zamboni,\u201d said Justin Smith, 29, on the return trip up Avenue A, while weighed down with a mirror and a glass desktop, both wrapped in towels, and an aluminum step ladder, among other items. He said the experience on the ice rinks had probably helped prepare him for the task of navigating a loaded cargo bike through the crowded streets of Manhattan.\u201cIn both cases all the weight is in front of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in both cases you have to be precise with your steering.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Failure to Lunch", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueThe lamentable rise of desktop dining.Supported bySchooled in anthropology, Lee works for the Hartman Group, a consulting firm. She helps clients like Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9, Whole Foods Market and Google better understand how people think about and consume food so they can repackage products and design new ones, find novel distribution methods or keep their own employees productive and well fed. After all her conversations, note taking and analysis, Lee summarizes her findings like this: \u2018\u2018The way people eat at work is pretty sad.\u2019\u2019Amy BloomProducer, Practical Magic, Sun Valley, Calif.Pepperoni pizza.In the 1987 movie \u2018\u2018Wall Street,\u2019\u2019 Gordon Gekko famously remarks, \u2018\u2018Lunch is for wimps.\u2019\u2019 It has proved to be a prescient line in the American workplace, where taking time off for lunch has increasingly become a sign of idleness. Breaking for a midday meal might have made more sense when laborers toiled with their bodies on tasks \u2014 building, planting, harvesting, manufacturing \u2014 that required rest and refueling. But in an economy where the standard task is sitting in front of a computer, lunch is less intuitive and far more optional.Now some 62 percent of professionals say they typically eat lunch at their desks, a phenomenon that social scientists have begun calling \u2018\u2018desktop dining.\u2019\u2019 Eating takes a back seat to meetings, catching up on to-dos or responding to email. Roughly half of American adults eat lunch alone. In research from the Hartman Group, many so-called millennial wage earners said they actually preferred eating solo. A quarter of those surveyed agreed with the statement \u2018\u2018I eat alone to multitask better.\u2019\u2019There is a possible health benefit to all of this: Our unaccompanied lunches are probably smaller. Studies on pigs, rats, puppies, chickens, gerbils and other animals dating back to the 1920s show a phenomenon researchers call \u2018\u2018social facilitation,\u2019\u2019 in which the presence of others makes an individual eat more. For years, scientists believed humans were different. Animals feed, they thought; humans dine. In subsequent research, it turned out that humans feed, too. Simply eating with one other person increases the average amount ingested by 44 percent. In fact, the more people present, the more people eat. One study showed that with seven or more, subjects ate 96 percent more than they would have alone.But with the clearly delineated lunch on the decline, workers end up snacking. In a study of 122 employees, people on average cached 476 calories\u2019 worth of food in their desks. One person squirreled away 3,000 calories, including Cheetos, candy bars and five cans of pop-top tuna fish. In addition to the personal food stashes, there are those areas in an office where food accumulates like driftwood \u2014 the leftover sandwiches from a catered lunch; the remains of a birthday cake; banana bread someone baked at home; the bottomless candy dish. When researchers interviewed administrative staff members at the University of California, Davis, one respondent called these common stockpiles \u2018\u2018food altars.\u2019\u2019Sometimes these collective food repositories become fraught, and in the case of shared workplace refrigerators, even hazardous. In a survey of more than 2,100 full-time professionals, nearly all had access to refrigerators. When asked about cleanliness, a full 40 percent were unaware of fridge cleaning or knew it to be rare or nonexistent. Navigating around a colleague\u2019s forgotten bag of slimy baby carrots might be gross, but the bigger danger in a fridge is the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Unlike other pathogens like E. coli, listeria can thrive at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the recommended temperature for refrigerators. Even in the Seattle law office of Bill Marler, the most prominent food-safety lawyer in the country, the fridge was, until recently, a mess of expired food, rotting salad and long-abandoned deli meat. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Like an insurance salesman not having insurance.\u2019\u2019Beyond any health risks, the desk lunch detracts from our sense of the office as a collaborative, innovative, sociable space. It is hard to foster that feeling when workers eat single-serving yogurt alone, faces lit in the monochrome blue of their computer screens. Brian Wansink, a professor and the director of Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab, points out that desktop dining isn\u2019t even a sign of industriousness anymore; these days, a desk luncher is as likely as not to be scrolling through Facebook. Wansink and other researchers did a survey of fire-department captains and lieutenants in a major American city. They found significant positive correlations between work performance and eating and cooking as a team. Firehouses where firefighters ate together reported more cooperative behavior; they were better at their jobs.Advertisement"}

But having had some bad luck on the dating scene, including a tumultuous breakup earlier that year, he refused to view her, or any other woman, through romantic eyes.\u201cI had been dating a person I thought I knew very well, but after two months, the whole thing just crashed and burned,\u201d he said. \u201cI was completely thrown for a loop, and I kept asking myself, \u2018Why do certain relationships fail?\u2019 I needed to take some time to reassess things.\u201dMr. Tillman consulted with his pastor at the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church.Pastor Craig Holliday had suggested a fast, though not from food but rather from romance. It is advice he has given others in the church.\u201cIt all depends on the individual situation and what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Holliday said. \u201cWhen it came to Joseph, there were a number of things that had gone on in his social life that he and I had discussed. I recommended the dating fast as a way to clear his head. I said, \u2018Don\u2019t date anyone for the rest of the year and let\u2019s talk around the beginning of the New Year.\u2019\u201dMr. Tillman took the recommendation to heart.\u201cIt was a time in my life when I had asked God to give me some clarity in terms of what I was looking for in a woman,\u201d he said.But it was clear that Ms. Powery was everything he was looking for in a friend.\u201cShe was so much fun to be around,\u201d he said, \u201cand we had so much in common.\u201dThey grew up in California, she in San Jose and he in Perris, and each stayed in-state to receive a bachelor of arts degree, she in psychology at U.S.C., and he in finance at California State University San Bernardino.Mr. Tillman moved to New York in 2009 to study for a law degree at N.Y.U. In 2012, he became a volunteer member of the young adult ministry of the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church. Ms. Powery, who arrived in New York in 2013 to study for a master\u2019s degree in social work from Columbia, joined the church a year later and volunteered in the same ministry.They made the California connection at the church retreat, after a quick introduction on a soccer field.After an evening sermon that night, Mr. Tillman was walking back to his cabin when he spotted Ms. Powery sitting alone on a bench around midnight, gazing at the stars. They began a conversation that lasted until 5 a.m., wandering around their campsite and engaging in what Ms. Powery described as \u201ca very deep, transparent conversation that set the tone for our friendship.\u201d\u201cWe talked openly about everything, including ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends, I mean everything,\u201d said Ms. Powery, who sings with a smaller segment of the renowned Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir during Friday night church services. \u201cWe learned a lot about each other on that trip.\u201dThose free-spirited discussions, Mr. Tillman said, were the byproduct of the fasting advice.\u201cSince I wasn\u2019t interested in dating Serena, I allowed myself to be more vulnerable in conversation than if I had approached her in a romantic way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we were able to be completely honest and nonjudgmental, and we just clicked and talked for hours and hours.\u201dThey talked about continuing their education, and their lives, in New York. Ms. Powery was still studying for her master\u2019s (which she earned in May 2015), while Mr. Tillman, who had already earned his law degree, was specializing in private equity fund formation at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, overseeing general fund structure and United States regulatory matters.\u201cThe fact that Serena and Joseph were both from California was a definite factor in the two of them hitting it off,\u201d said Juliana O\u2019Brien, a lifelong friend of Ms. Powery from San Jose. \u201cWe\u2019re a different breed out in California, much more relaxed and much warmer, and they found those qualities in each other.\u201dThree months into her friendship with Mr. Tillman, Ms. Powery broke up with her boyfriend. Her friendship with Mr. Tillman remained strong as they continued worshiping together and often going for long walks and talks around Manhattan, where Mr. Tillman lived.But the dating fast continued. There were no romantic overtures.\u201cJust hanging out and telling jokes,\u201d she said. \u201cNot taking life too seriously.\u201dIn January 2015, Ms. Powery was aware that Mr. Tillman had begun dating again. Three months later, Ms. Powery told him that she had been accepted to the Peace Corps, in rural El Salvador.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it as if to say, \u2018Well, if we\u2019re not going to be together, I\u2019m going to run off and join the Peace Corps,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was already resigned to the fact that Joseph was just going to be a good friend, but I was also of the mind-set that I was young and single, and I thought that if this is where God wants me to be, then why not pick up and leave?\u201dMr. Tillman was shaken by her decision. \u201cMy head started spinning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Whoa, wait a minute. I need more details.\u2019\u201dThey discussed it the next day over lunch, during which Mr. Tillman made a confession.\u201cI told her that since she was leaving anyway, it couldn\u2019t hurt to tell her that I remembered thinking after our first conversation that we had a great connection, but since I wasn\u2019t dating anyone at that time, I just sort of ignored it. I told her that I did think something was there, and though I didn\u2019t know if it was friendly or romantic, it was something I didn\u2019t want to let go of.\u201dIn recalling the moment, Ms. Powery offered a confession of her own.\u201cI\u2019m sitting there pretending to be all cool,\u201d she said. \u201cDeep inside I\u2019m shouting: Yes! Praise the Lord! We\u2019re finally on the same page.\u201dIn June 2015, Mr. Tillman officially began dating Ms. Powery, who was then living in Harlem and working in Brooklyn as a social worker at New York Therapeutic Communities.In October 2015, she began working in the Bronx as a youth justice social worker for the Center for Court Innovation, seeking alternatives to prison for 16- and 17-year-olds who commit misdemeanor crimes.Earlier that month, Mr. Tillman had gone back to the West Coast to cheer for Ms. Powery, who was participating in the Arthritis Foundation California Coast Classic Bike Tour, an eight-day 525-mile bike ride that began in San Francisco and ended in Los Angeles. Also riding were Ms. Powery\u2019s parents, Maria Powery and Dwight Powery, and her sister, Evelyn Powery.\u201cWe do it every year in memory of my younger sister who died from a more complicated disease, but she also had arthritis,\u201d Ms. Powery said.Soon after she rode across the finish line, Mr. Tillman, who had been waiting there, proposed.\u201cSerena knew all along that Joseph was the one,\u201d said Maria Powery. \u201cEverything has worked out perfectly for them.\u201dIncluding Ms. Powery\u2019s commitment to the Peace Corps, which was scheduled to begin in March. Though she had intended to forgo her service, she received an email two months ago from the Peace Corps, and learned that the cohort that she was to be a part of had been canceled. \u201cIt was further confirmation that Joseph and I were meant to be together,\u201d she said.They were married Jan. 31 by their pastor, Mr. Holliday, at the Kirkpatrick Chapel on the campus of Rutgers in New Brunswick, N.J.The groom waited and watched with 160 guests as the chapel\u2019s center doors opened wide. There stood Mr. Tillman\u2019s best friend, clutching a bouquet of white roses in her hands.\u201cIn every home, there is a thermostat and a thermometer,\u201d Mr. Holliday told them. \u201cJoseph, you are the thermostat. You will regulate the spiritual temperature in your new home, and based on your actions, Serena, who is your thermometer, will let you know what the temperature is.\u201dGail Tillman, the groom\u2019s mother, with tears in her eyes, watched her son and his wife enjoy their first dance togetherto \u201cAt Last,\u201d by Etta James. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect soul mates,\u201d she said at the reception, held at The Palace at Somerset Park in Somerset, N.J.Mr. Tillman had, at last, found in Ms. Powery the answer to a question he need no longer ask.\u201cThe moment I slipped that ring on her finger, I knew why so many relationships fail,\u201d he said. \u201cA true relationship can only last if it begins with an honest, solid friendship, like the one Serena and I have had from Day 1.\u201dMr. Tillman was inspired to go on his \u201cdating fast\u201d by Pastor Craig Holliday, a minister of the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church in Brooklyn, where the groom is a congregant. Pastor Holliday discussed what inspires him to sometimes advise men and women in his church to take a break from romance.Q: Have you given this advice to anyone else in the church?A: Yes, on occasion. It\u2019s important because unless you begin to identify the areas in your own life that you need help in, by God\u2019s grace, then all you will do is jump from one bad relationship to the next because you have brought these problems with you. And that is what I didn\u2019t want Joseph to do. He had been going through some bad relationships over a two- to three-year period, so finally I just said, \u201cStop, it\u2019s time to look at your own life and ask yourself \u2018What is it about me that needs to change?\u2019\u201d Because ultimately, the common denominator of every relationship he got himself into was himself. So now you have to step back and say, \u201cThese things aren\u2019t working out.\u201d You need to take the time to ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I bringing to the table?\u201dQ: Do you recommend a dating fast to women as well as men?A: I have advised both men and women, who have sought my counsel, to go on dating fasts. I currently have a couple of young ladies within the church who are in that kind of holding pattern when it comes to dating.Q: What kind of feedback do you receive from people who have taken your advice?A: I\u2019ve never had anyone come back to me and say \u201cI don\u2019t think it was such a good thing.\u201d I would say that every single person has come back to me and thanked me for encouraging them to do it, and all of them have said that it was a good way to help keep themselves accountable in relationships.Q: Is there a timetable for these dating fasts?A: It all depends on the individual and his or her situation. The shortest dating fast I ever recommended has been six months. You first have to get to a place of acknowledgment and then start working through certain issues, and I don\u2019t think anyone can do that in 30 days. I currently have another young man on a dating fast for the past year, and though he has really grown during that time, he has told me that he will continue to fast because he still needs a lot of work.A Matchmaker Finds a Love of Her OwnAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America,\u2019 by Michael Eric Dyson", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What happens when the nation\u2019s foremost voice on the race question is also its most confined and restrained? Michael Eric Dyson raises this question about President Obama in his latest book, \u201cThe Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America.\u201d The book inspires one to raise similar questions about Dyson himself. For, while hardly restrained, Dyson appears noticeably boxed in by the limitations placed on celebrity race commentators in the Age of Obama.A certain optimism ebbs and flows in \u201cThe Black Presidency,\u201d but only occasionally does it refer to white Americans\u2019 beliefs about race. Far more often, Dyson hangs hope on Obama\u2019s impromptu shows of racial solidarity. One such moment was the president\u2019s remarks after the 2009 arrest of the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. (who was arrested trying to get into his own home). Another was Obama\u2019s public identification with Trayvon Martin. Both acts may have been politically risky, but they also greatly heartened African- Americans. Hope builds, and by book\u2019s end, readers find a chapter-long celebration of the president\u2019s soaring invocations of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d during last year\u2019s memorial service for the slain parishioners of Emanuel A.M.E. Church. For Dyson, the eulogy at Emanuel seems to serve as a sign of grace that black America may still yet enjoy from the Obama White House.Its cresting invocations of hope aside, the book ably maintains a sharp critical edge. Dyson uncovers a troubling consistency to the president\u2019s race speech and shows that in spite of Obama\u2019s reliance on black political networks and black votes during his meteoric rise, the president chose to follow a governing and rhetorical template largely hewed by his white predecessors. As both candidate and president, Obama\u2019s speeches have tended to allay white guilt. They have scolded \u00adAfrican-American masses for cultural pathology and implied that blacks were to blame for lingering white antipathy. Obama\u2019s speeches have also often consigned the worst forms of racism and anti-black violence to the past or to the fringes of American political culture. One finds passive-voice constructions everywhere in Obama\u2019s race talk, as black folk are found suffering under pressures and at the hands of parties that go largely unnamed. \u201cObama is forced to exaggerate black responsibility,\u201d Dyson advances, \u201cbecause he must always underplay white responsibility.\u201dCritically, Dyson contends that the president\u2019s tepid anti-racism comes from political pragmatism rather than a set of deeper ideological concerns. \u201cObama is anti-ideological,\u201d Dyson maintains, and that is \u201cthe very reason he was electable.\u201dThat characterization, however, overlooks how liberal pragmatism functions as ideology. What\u2019s more, it ignores the marginalization and violence that black and brown people often suffer \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 whenever moderates resolve to \u201cget things done.\u201d If the Obama era proved anything about liberalism, it\u2019s that there remains little room for an explicit policy approach to racial justice \u2014 even, or perhaps especially, under a black president. As Obama himself explains to Dyson: \u201cI have to appropriate dollars for any program which has to go through ways and means committees, or appropriations committees, that are not dominated by folks who read Cornel West or listen to Michael Eric Dyson.\u201dUpon a careful reading of Dyson\u2019s book, loss seems always to arrive on the heels of hope. As we might expect, the author explores Obama\u2019s estrangement from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright in 2008. He also attends to his own very public and more recent split from Cornel West. But even beyond these signal episodes, \u201cThe Black Presidency\u201d is suffused with a bittersweet tone about relationships strained. President Obama seems to leave a host of people and political commitments at the White House door as he conforms to the racial demands of a historically white office. Even Dyson seems unaware of all the ways in which \u201cThe Black Presidency,\u201d as a book, both explicates and illustrates how the Obama administration leaves black folk behind.Moments like these have a secondary effect. They illuminate a tension cutting through and profoundly limiting \u201cThe Black Presidency\u201d as a work of political commentary. Regardless of who Michael Eric Dyson may have been to Obama the candidate, Dyson now has barely any access to Obama the president. Time and circumstance have rendered Dyson, the man and the thinker, increasingly irrelevant to Obama\u2019s presidency. He can be at the party, but not at the table.Perhaps worse in relation to the book\u2019s stated aim to be the first full measure of Obama and America\u2019s race problem, Dy\u00adson, the author, has none but only the smallest role to play in assessing and narrating Obama\u2019s legacy. When Bill Clinton decided to chronicle his own historic turn in the White House, he called on Taylor Branch and recorded with the historian some 150 hours of interviews over 79 separate sessions. Dyson, in 2015, gets far shabbier treatment. Chapter 5, \u201cThe Scold of Black Folk,\u201d opens: \u201cI was waiting outside the Oval Office to speak to President Obama. I had a tough time getting on his schedule.\u201d In response to Dyson\u2019s request for a presidential audience, the White House offered the author 10 whole minutes. By his own telling, Dyson \u201cpolitely declined\u201d and pressed Obama\u2019s confidante, Valerie Jarrett, to remember his long history with and support of the president. \u201cI eventually negotiated a 20-minute interview that turned into half an hour.\u201d It appears to be the only interview Dyson conducted for the book.In the end, \u201cThe Black Presidency\u201d possesses a loaves-and-fishes quality. Drawing mostly on the news cycle, close readings of carefully crafted speeches and a handful of glittering encounters, Dyson has managed to do a lot with a little. The book might well be considered an interpretive miracle, one performed in fealty and hope for a future show of presidential grace, either from this president or, should she get elected, the next one.THE BLACK PRESIDENCYBarack Obama and the Politics of Race in AmericaBy Michael Eric Dyson346 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.N.

{"Headline": "Long After Bergdahl\u2019s Release, His Hometown Is Still Under Siege", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byHAILEY, Idaho \u2014 It was the third text message from the unfamiliar number \u2014 the one that made direct reference to Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \u2014 that frightened Sherry Horton. It was written in nearly unintelligible gibberish, but its tone was unmistakably menacing.Here in Hailey, death threats soon followed \u2014 hundreds of calls to the Chamber of Commerce and to businesses owned by people who had most visibly supported Sergeant Bergdahl, including the wine bar that Ms. Horton partly owns. The town canceled plans for a public celebration after a hostile biker gang and angry veterans\u2019 groups threatened to disrupt it. A crude bomb filled with black powder was left outside a local business.\u201cWe were put through the worst of it,\u201d said Ms. Horton, who taught Sergeant Bergdahl ballet and remains close with the soldier. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not over for us, that\u2019s pretty freaking clear.\u201dThe valley that surrounds Hailey is a relatively affluent and liberal sliver in a deeply conservative state, which added to the sense of being under siege in the immediate aftermath of Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s release.\u201cThere\u2019s some really ignorant people who live some places in the West,\u201d said Fritz Haemmerle, the mayor. \u201cThey\u2019re very right wing, they\u2019re very militant, they\u2019re very uninformed and they\u2019re people with guns and with an attitude.\u201dMaps of where Bowe Bergdahl was stationed and the initial operations to find him.The harassment of people here may have tapered off since the weeks after Sergeant Bergdahl was released, Mr. Schoen said, but the overall threat remains. \u201cAm I concerned?\u201d he said. \u201cYes. And is the level of threat serious? It is.\u201dThere is also far more ambivalence about Sergeant Bergdahl, who now faces a court-martial and a possible life sentence on charges of desertion and endangering troops stemming from his decision to leave his outpost in 2009, a move that led to his capture by the Taliban. In the five years Sergeant Bergdahl was held, the exact circumstances of his capture remained unclear, and the people of Hailey embraced him.People in town critical of Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s actions did not want to be quoted, in part out of deference to his parents, Robert and Jani Bergdahl, who still live outside town. One man, Doug, who would not give his full name, said that if people found out that someone was bothering the Bergdahls, \u201cno one here is going to talk to you about anything.\u201dOthers say they are not happy that Sergeant Bergdahl, who is on administrative duty at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, has become the town\u2019s most well-known native son.\u201cThis town\u2019s been a town since about 1882,\u201d Mr. Haemmerle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people fight in probably every single war since that day. We\u2019ve got dead people in our cemeteries, veterans, you name it, we have it.\u201dHailey is still welcoming to outsiders, Ms. Horton insisted. \u201cWe rely on tourism here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not friendly, we\u2019re all going under.\u201d But there are limits: \u201cWe don\u2019t trust just anybody in this town anymore, not until we know what they\u2019re about and why they want to know what they\u2019re asking.\u201dSergeant Bergdahl\u2019s parents, who were at the White House when President Obama announced Sergeant Berghdahl\u2019s release, have not spoken publicly since their son was set free. Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s father, in particular, was criticized for growing a beard, learning to speak Pashto and studying the Quran in hopes of finding a way to free his child.Sergeant Bergdahl told the same story to Army investigators, who found it credible. Lt. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl, the lead investigator, said at a preliminary hearing in September that Sergeant Bergdahl had delusional expectations for his deployment. The general also said there was no evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl, who identified with John Galt, the hero in Ayn Rand\u2019s novel \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d intended to desert or that any soldiers had been killed while searching for him.The brunt of the threats in Hailey were borne by a small group of women who had led the campaign to free Sergeant Bergdahl. Some knew him because \u201che danced with their daughters,\u201d said Ms. Horton, the ballet teacher, who also let Sergeant Bergdahl live at her house during stretches of his teenage years when his family life was strained.He was quirky and well mannered and definitely made an impression on the women, she said. Even as a teenager, \u201che was opening doors and doing all that, as opposed to with men, where he wouldn\u2019t have done those things.\u201dSue Martin, who employed Sergeant Bergdahl at her Zaney\u2019s River Street Coffee House, also became a target in the aftermath of his release. Zaney\u2019s was the unofficial headquarters of the campaign to free Sergeant Bergdahl.Within days, she decided to close up the shop for about two weeks. She has since intermittently shuttered her business when Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s case makes news, and has done her best to stay out of the spotlight the rest of the time.\u201cI think people don\u2019t realize the significance of the backlash on people in town,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And she implored Republicans to respect Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to nominate a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany Republicans talk in coded racial language,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to applause from the audience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the fringe\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the party.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president has the right to nominate under the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the Senate has the obligation to process that nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton was accompanied on stage by some of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prominent Democrats, including Gov.

That is by design, as the firm deploys specialized trading strategies to capture arbitrage profits by buying and selling (using its own capital) large amounts of E.T.F. shares.It\u2019s a risky business.And in many cases, some of the most popular E.T.F.s track hard-to-trade securities like junk bonds, emerging-market stocks and a variety of derivative products, adding an extra layer of risk.These dangers were brought home last August, when markets were rattled by China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency; some of the largest E.T.F.s sank by 50 percent or more.While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what they can do,\u201d said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. \u201cIf you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it\u2019s fewer and fewer firms.\u201dIt is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion.And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader \u2014 one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm\u2019s capital.In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop.Here is a small sample of Jane Street\u2019s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master\u2019s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master\u2019s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor\u2019s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon).For large asset management firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and Invesco, the business of rolling out one E.T.F. after another has become a major profit center. But in many ways, the real money is being made by the trading firms that specialize in making a market in these securities.For example, Jane Street, which is privately held, has increased its shareholder\u2019s equity, or net worth, to more than $1 billion today from $228 million in 2007.That cash cushion handily surpasses what such established investment banks as Evercore, Moelis and Greenhill have (as of 2014) as well as that at money management firms like Eaton Vance.Moreover, it supports just 450 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business.Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level.Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm\u2019s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading.A star trader for the company, he also oversees its hiring process.Jane Street has acquired a reputation for being perhaps the toughest interview in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.This is in part because the firm hires only a handful of new employees each year. To survive, candidates have to ace brain-twisting math riddles and game theory tests.But as Mr. Lehoczky has said when asked what he is looking for in an E.T.F. trader, the ideal candidate possesses what he calls second-order knowledge \u2014 a form of intellectual humility in which really smart people can accept being wrong and own up to mistakes.In that vein, a prospect might be fed a math problem that cannot be answered, just to gauge reaction to failure.Because Jane Street finds itself competing more with Facebook and Google for talent than with, say, Goldman Sachs, the firm lays on the perks. These include a catered breakfast and lunch, a substantial gym right off the trading floor, generous child care benefits and an in-house speaker series that has featured the likes of Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens and Garry Kasparov.As for compensation, how much Jane Street\u2019s rocket scientists get paid is as closely guarded a secret as its trading formulas. Still, it is apparently quite a bit.\u201cAs a trader, if you do well, you will retire before you turn 30,\u201d said one employee on an industry message board.A number of larger banks, Goldman in particular, have been involved in exchange-traded funds for some time now, but the rest of the Wall Street banks are seeking to recruit their own E.T.F. hotshots.One such trader is Monish Shah, a 31-year-old native of Mumbai, who was hired by the Japanese bank Mizuho to build a trading desk in its New York office.Mr. Shah fits the profile of the up-and-coming E.T.F. trader: He is young, has a master\u2019s degree in quantitative finance at Georgia Tech and is as much a writer of code as he is a trader.On an old-school trading desk of mostly white men in their 50s buying and selling common stock, Mr. Shah stands out.Ensconced at the far end of the firm\u2019s equity desk, his four computer screens flash an array of color-coded execution cues, and he is a frequent target of good-natured trading-room banter, sending up his supersize console, his youth and even his Indian accent.As stocks tumbled yet again on a Friday this month, curses rang out up and down the desk. An E.T.F. that Mr. Shah had been eyeing was down more than 3 percent, and now his color-coded signals were flashing green for buy \u2014 which is what he did, just as the market bell rang at 4 p.m.Within a half-hour, the desk was empty as his colleagues rushed to catch the early train home. But Mr. Shah was not going anywhere; he had a business to build.\u201cThere are so many moving parts; if just one thing goes wrong, you get killed,\u201d Mr. Shah said, letting out a slow sigh. \u201cSo yes, it is stressful \u2014 but it is also my passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kansas, Pop-Pop-Pop, Then Terror: \u2018We Got to Go\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byHESSTON, Kan. \u2014 A little more than two hours into his painting shift at the Excel Industries plant here, Matt Jarrell\u2019s co-worker Cedric Ford was nowhere to be found. Mr. Ford was one of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s best friends on the job; that day, he had promised to help Mr. Ford remove a rusty screw from the old gray Nissan pickup truck he had recently bought.When another employee stepped in to relieve him, Mr. Jarrell went out to the parking lot and saw Mr. Ford roll up in a different truck that screeched to a halt. Mr. Jarrell recalled that his friend hopped out holding a rifle, shot a person in front of him, then ran into the factory and kept shooting.Michael P. Dellinger looked up in the direction of the pop-pop-pop noise and saw Mr. Ford \u201cjust standing there with a rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me a second to realize. He just kept shooting. I grabbed a guy standing next to me and said, \u2018We got to go.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAs the authorities piece together what led Mr. Ford, 38, to fatally shoot three of his colleagues and injure 14 more on Thursday, the latest in a long string of mass shootings, starkly contradictory pictures of him have emerged. Stunned friends and co-workers described a gregarious yet quiet man, a steady worker who glowed about his children \u2014 more subdued in recent weeks, but giving no hint of the mayhem to come.But Mr. Ford had an extensive criminal record, and in an application this month for a restraining order, his former girlfriend described him in terms his co-workers would not have recognized: \u201cHe is an alcoholic, violent, depressed, it\u2019s my belief he is in desperate need of medical and psychological help!\u201dIt was that restraining order, served on Mr. Ford at work about 90 minutes before the shooting spree began, that might have set off his rampage, said Sheriff T. Walton of Harvey County.The three people killed, all Excel employees, were identified as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.Inside the plant, which makes riding mowers and other lawn care equipment, a moment\u2019s hesitation after the first gunshots gave way to pandemonium, as it dawned on people that a colleague was trying to gun them down. Then came a frantic dash for escape or someplace to hide, and the horror of seeing wounded and dead friends on the floor.Firing an assault rifle, Mr. Ford did not seem to have particular victims in mind, Sheriff Walton said. Minutes after the shooting started, a Hesston police officer went into the factory, traded fire with the gunman, and killed him. If not for that officer, the sheriff said, the death toll could have been much higher. The sheriff would not name the officer, but Gov. Sam Brownback identified him as Doug Schroeder, the Hesston police chief.\u201cThat particular officer\u2019s the hero out of all this,\u201d Sheriff Walton said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably two or three hundred more people still in that plant. That guy was not going to stop shooting.\u201dAdam Miller heard someone yell \u201cFire!\u201d a code word for trouble, and then spotted Mr. Ford, according to his father, Douglas Miller. \u201cHe yelled at him, \u2018Fire! Fire!\u2019\u201d the father said, repeating the story Adam had told him from a hospital bed. \u201cCedric said, \u2018Yes, I know,\u2019 and he raised his rifle and fired at him four times.\u201dThe younger Mr. Miller was shot twice in the chest, once in the arm and once in the leg, but was later able to post to Facebook, \u201cI am doing very well despite taking 4 for the team.\u201dMr. Dellinger, 20, said that he and another employee ran out a nearby door, but that Mr. Ford followed them. \u201cI could hear him shooting behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cI jumped over a stack of lawnmower decks, and I heard bullets hitting the lawnmower decks. We just kept running, hearing the bullets zing past us.\u201d\u201cThere were three people behind me that got hit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not even arm\u2019s length away.\u201dCo-workers tore their own clothing to make bandages and tourniquets for people who were bleeding.An off-duty Hesston police sergeant, Chris Carter, who has relatives who work at the factory, was one of the first law enforcement officers on the scene, and transported one wounded person in his pickup truck. He called the scene \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\u201cWe train for these,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re prepared for what you see.\u201dPresident Obama offered condolences to the victims and thanks to the police and emergency workers, in a call on Friday to the mayor of Hesston, David K. Kauffman. In Jacksonville, Fla., he prefaced an economic speech by calling attention to the Kansas shooting, and one on Saturday in Kalamazoo, Mich., and making his latest plea for action to curb gun violence.\u201cThese are two more communities in America that are torn apart by grief,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine.\u201dIn the Hesston area, north of Wichita, some said the gunman had hit the region at its heart. In a town with fewer than 4,000 people, the Excel plant is a hub where brothers work side by side, spouses pass each other on breaks, and fathers and sons clock in and out together.Mr. Ford was arrested twice in November 2008, and was convicted of disorderly conduct and of harassment by telephone, a misdemeanor. He was also convicted in 2010 of driving under the influence. It was not clear how much time in jail he served. Florida records show that he was arrested repeatedly in the Miami area from 1996 to 2005, pleaded guilty to carrying a concealed weapon in 1996, and again in 1997, and pleaded no contest to burglary in 2001.In her application for a restraining order, his former girlfriend said that he had choked her in January, that the relationship was over, and that he was moving out of the mobile home they shared.Mr. Ford grew up in Miami Gardens, Fla., where he lived with his mother and two sisters. His mother, Ruthie May Ford, who now lives in Homestead, Fla., answered the door of her apartment on Friday and said she was doing \u201cas well as can be expected,\u201d given the news about her son. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to process the idea of what happened.\u201dMr. Ford moved to Kansas several years ago and, according to friends, had multiple girlfriends, and two children. Blake Harford, 25, who also worked at the Excel plant, said they bonded over firearms and their children.The same passions were clear on Mr. Ford\u2019s Facebook page, where there were pictures of him with a boy and a girl, playing miniature golf, visiting the zoo, fishing, and carving pumpkins. There are also pictures of him with guns, including one posted on Feb. 15, with a rifle. Months earlier, he posted a video of himself shooting a rifle, firing the weapon repeatedly into a cornfield.In an exchange of Facebook messages, Mr. Harford wrote of Mr. Ford\u2019s children: \u201cThey were his world. Nothin he wouldn\u2019t do for them even in times when he didn\u2019t get along with their mother.\u201d As for guns, \u201che had a passion for them not in a way to wanna hurt people.\u201dMr. Jarrell said that lately, his friend seemed down and uncharacteristically unkempt, shaving less often. Sergeant Carter said he went to Excel about two weeks ago to serve what is called a temporary protection from abuse order on Mr. Ford, whose reaction was subdued. The sheriff said that after deputies from his office delivered a permanent order about 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, \u201cThey said he was upset, but nothing greater than anybody else who gets served a P.F.A.\u201dAbout 5 p.m., on the outskirts of Newton, about six miles from the factory, Mr. Ford fired out the window of his car, wounding a man, officials said. Minutes later, there was another shooting a short distance away. In the second shooting, the sheriff said, Mr. Ford drove straight at an oncoming motorist until both swerved into a ditch, then got out of his car, shot the other person, and stole the other vehicle.Mr. Ford apparently drove from there to Excel.Sheriff Walton, at a news conference on Friday, said that in 28 years in the department he had seen nothing like this kind of bloodshed.\u201cAs far as, \u2018We don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to happen here\u2019 \u2014 well, isn\u2019t that what every sheriff says that\u2019s stuck up on the podium like I am?\u201d he asked. \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t the sheriff in front of these cameras.\u201dJohn Eligon reported from Hesston, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York, and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.

The Ohio Democratic Party issued a news release with the title, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKasich Gives Don Draper a Run for His Money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referring to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMad Men\u00e2\u0080\u009d character.Dawn Laguens, an official with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, called his comment \u00e2\u0080\u009cflat-out insulting\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said his \u00e2\u0080\u009ccondescending attitude toward women needs to stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd Ilyse Hogue, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I heard John Kasich\u2019s latest offensive views on women and our rights, I almost dropped the casserole I was taking out of the oven!\u00e2\u0080\u009dHillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign also responded to his comment, posting on Twitter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s 2016.

{"Headline": "The Promise of Artificial Intelligence Unfolds in Small Steps", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWhen IBM\u2019s Watson computer triumphed over human champions in the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d it was a stunning achievement that suggested limitless horizons for artificial intelligence.Soon after, IBM\u2019s leaders moved to convert Watson from a celebrated science project into a moneymaking business, starting with health care.Yet the next few years after its game show win proved humbling for Watson. Today, IBM executives candidly admit that medicine proved far more difficult than they anticipated. Costs and frustration mounted on Watson\u2019s early projects. They were scaled back, refocused and occasionally shelved.IBM\u2019s early struggles with Watson point to the sobering fact that commercializing new technology, however promising, typically comes in short steps rather than giant leaps.Despite IBM\u2019s own challenges, Watson\u2019s TV victory \u2014 five years ago this month \u2014 has helped fuel interest in A.I. from the public and the rest of the tech industry. Venture capital investors have poured money into A.I. start-ups, and large corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have been buying fledgling A.I. companies. That investment reached $8.5 billion last year, more than three and a half times the level in 2010, according to Quid, a data analysis firm.And software engineers with A.I. skills are treated like star athletes, prompting bidding wars for their services.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a peak of excitement now,\u201d said Jerry Kaplan, a computer scientist, entrepreneur and author, who was a co-founder of a long-forgotten A.I. start-up in the 1980s. \u201cExpectations are way ahead of reality.\u201dThe term A.I. has long been a staple of science fiction \u2014 as machines that think for themselves and help humankind or as ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out. Or so the thinking at the movies goes.The reality, however, is a little less dramatic. The automated voice on your smartphone that tries to answer your questions? That\u2019s a type of A.I. So are features of Google\u2019s search engine. The technology is also being applied to complex business problems like finding trends in cancer research.The field of artificial intelligence goes back to the beginning of the computer age and it has rolled through cycles of optimism and disillusion ever since, encouraged by a few movie robots and one very successful game show contestant.The history of tech tells A.I. backers to hang in there. Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.Predictions made in the \u201990s about how the new World Wide Web would shake the foundations of the media, advertising and retailing industries did prove to be true, for example. But it happened a decade later, years after the dot-com bust.Today\u2019s A.I., even optimists say, is early in that cycle.\u201cI think future generations are going to look back on the A.I. revolution and compare its impact to the steam engine or electricity,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cBut, of course, it is going to take decades for this technology to really come to fruition.\u201dThere are reasons for enthusiasm. Computers continue to get cheaper even as they get more powerful, making it easier than ever to crunch vast amounts of data in an instant. Also, sensors, smartphones and other tech devices are all over the place, feeding more and more information into computers that are learning more and more about us.Just in the last year or two, researchers have made rapid gains using a machine-learning technique called deep learning to improve the performance of software that recognizes images, translates languages and understands speech. That work has been done at start-ups and at big companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, as well as at universities and private research centers like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\u201cThere\u2019s been surprising progress in the problems of perception, seeing, hearing and language,\u201d said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research.At Enlitic, a start-up in San Francisco, Jeremy Howard, the founder and chief executive, believes that A.I. can transform the huge industry of health care, saving lives and money \u2014 an ambition similar to IBM\u2019s. \u201cBut that\u2019s a 25-year project,\u201d he said.Enlitic is concentrating first on radiology. Medical images are nearly all in digital form, Mr. Howard notes, and the tireless scanning for telltale signs of abnormal tissue is a task for which deep-learning image recognition technology is well suited.Enlitic has tested its software against a database of 6,000 lung cancer diagnoses, both positive and negative, made by professional radiologists. In research soon to be published, its algorithm was 50 percent more accurate than human radiologists, Enlitic said.\u201cYou have to take technology that works and apply it to a known problem,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cInnovation alone is a mistake.\u201dNo company has made as big or as broad a bid to commercialize its A.I. technology as IBM has with Watson. It set up Watson as its own business in 2014, and invested billions to accelerate the development and adoption of the technology, including buying several companies. The Watson unit now has 7,000 employees.The Watson technology has been totally revamped. In its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d days, Watson was a room-size computer. Today, it is so-called cloud software, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers. The Watson software itself has been carved up into dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition.IBM is trying to position Watson as the equivalent of an A.I. operating system, a software platform others use to build applications. Nearly 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software. IBM now has more than 500 industry partners, from big companies to start-ups, in industries including health care, financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services.At IBM, Watson\u2019s early struggles in health care are viewed as a learning experience. The IBM teams, the executives say, underestimated the difficulty of grappling with messy data like faxes and handwritten notes and failed to understand how physicians make decisions.\u201cThere were a lot of challenges with the early customers,\u201d said John Kelly, the senior vice president who oversees Watson, adding that the business was \u201ctaking off\u201d now.IBM does not break out financial results for Watson. It describes the business as \u201clarge and growing,\u201d contributing to the company\u2019s $18 billion a year in revenue from business analytics.At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Watson technology is one ingredient in an automated expert adviser for cancer care. The University of Texas health system is also using Watson in software to help diabetes patients and caregivers manage the disease, in a project that is expected to be introduced by the end of this year.\u201cIt was a lot harder than we thought,\u201d said Dr. Lynda Chin, the chief innovation officer for the university health system. \u201cBut our experience has convinced me that we can build an A.I. engine that improves care.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s signature issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his hard-line immigration positions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suggesting that Mr. Trump was insulting the intelligence of his supporters.Noting that Mr. Trump had recently said that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cloved the poorly educated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said the Republican front-runner in the polls seemed to be hoodwinking his supporters.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump\u2019s record on immigration is terrible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senator told reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody who supports open-border Democrats for 40 years can care about securing the borders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAndrew Rosenthal, editorial page editor of The Times, did not comment on the contents of the meeting, but said that if Mr. Trump \u201cwants to call up and ask us to release this transcript, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free to do that and then we can decide what we would do.\u201dBefore a rollicking home-state crowd inside an auditorium here, Mr. Cruz on Monday called on Mr. Trump to ask for the details of the meeting to be released.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting in Manhattan telling The New York Times that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lying to the voters, the voters have a right to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said to cheers.In one sense, Mr. Cruz was walking a delicate line. On Sunday, one of his chief allies in the Senate, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, endorsed Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz has cited Mr. Sessions as someone who stood \u00e2\u0080\u009cshoulder to shoulder\u00e2\u0080\u009d with him to stifle immigration legislation in 2013.Asked whether the endorsement undercut his argument against Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz was careful to avoid criticizing Mr. Sessions directly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJeff Sessions is a good man, he is a good friend and he is a principled senator who fights passionately for his causes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record is open for everyone to examine. It is a fact that for four decades Donald Trump has supported open-border Democrats.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn his remarks, Mr. Cruz also folded in an attack on the immigration record of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, while still managing a hit on Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Marco Rubio was leading the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump was funding the Gang of Eight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said of the 2013 legislation that Mr. Rubio helped engineer.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d someone shouted from the crowd.At his news conference, Mr. Cruz said his was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only campaign that has a shot of beating Donald Trump on Super Tuesday.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also dismissed any discussion of a brokered convention, suggesting that Mr. Rubio and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio would be doing Republicans no favors if they pledged to fight into the summer to prevent Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA campaign sticking around when you can\u2019t win a state and you\u2019re not amassing delegates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to come together. And I think after Super Tuesday, we will see this race become more and more a two-man race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He described a contested convention as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe great hope of the Republican establishment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is how they are drowning away their sorrows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a brokered convention and all these crazy voters will go one way and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll step in with all of our money and we will anoint our white knight to ride in and save the day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d He concluded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to have a brokered convention.

{"Headline": "A Road Trip to the Origins of Our Species", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "I.It was on an all-night Capitol Air flight to Brussels, sitting in the back smoking rows with Leon Festinger, playing endless backgammon and consuming Scotch at an alarming rate, that I realized that, whether I liked it or not, I was about to learn a lot about human origins and uniqueness.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had extensive discussions in New York, secured a small study grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and were off to France to learn more about lithic technology (the production of tools from stone) from a master of the discipline, the archaeologist Jacques Tixier. We wanted to know what on earth had happened roughly one million years earlier when humankind started to make stone tools. As we exited the cigarette-fouled cabin after the long flight, Leon calmly observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know when they outlaw smoking on planes, I am not going to be able to make these trips anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTixier also narrated as he worked, explaining in clear language what he was doing. He was telling the story of this particular tool as it was made. Luckily for me it was in English.It was soon evident that Leon and I were considering two different aspects of this magical afternoon. On his large canvas of the evolution of humankind, he was taken both with the incredible insight of early humans to use the power of external objects (technology) for work and to be persistent in its development. It was, and still is, the inventive human mind producing technologies, and then teaching them to others, as David Premack pointed out, that pushes humankind ahead.What fascinated me was the million-year plateau, the long period that passed when not much changed in stone-tool sophistication. Then suddenly, about 100,000 years ago, all the complexity we witnessed in Tixier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tools began to appear. We estimate that human language emerged about 100,000 years ago as well. This is the point when language quickly becomes almost essential to complex thought. For decades, scholars have sought to link the appearance of language to all the grand things we humans do. I recalled that it was when Tixier provided the verbal narrative to the toolmaking process that it became so clear to us. A word says a lot, and the resulting savings on the mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources is huge.Yet to dwell on the role of language misses Leon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying insight. It is the more primitive inventiveness of humans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 technology and its role as the engine that powered humankind to dazzling heights of accomplishment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that pushed the slow grind of advancement into the fast lane of evolution. And Leon, being a social psychologist at his core, began to see how technology could be used to control human life. Technologies are not only physical things. They can be social forces as well, like philosophical or religious beliefs.II.Some years before our Paris trip, my own work in split-brain science had taken a new turn. In 1976, my student Joseph LeDoux and I were studying a teenaged boy, known in the scientific literature as P.S. He had undergone split-brain surgery, which severed the pathways between the left and right hemispheres of his brain in an effort to curb his epilepsy. We were in the business of cataloging which mental functions were located in the left and right brains.We had long known that language and speech processes were located in the left hemisphere, but absent from the right hemisphere, where various nonverbal skills are carried out. In normal, nonsplit brain cases, the two sides work together by integrating the information each receives. But in split-brain patients like P.S., that communication between hemispheres is cut off.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.Here, visual perception plays an important role. Normally when a person focuses on a point in space, all visual information to the right of the fixated point is projected to the left brain and all visual information to the left of the point is projected to the right hemisphere. So by positioning images in certain places in relation to the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focal point we can deliver visual information to either side of the brain. Images or words perceived by the left hemisphere can be easily described with language, but those perceived by the right cannot.In the classic test for split-brain subjects, we flashed a picture of a snow scene to the right-half brain, while at the same time we flashed a picture of chicken claw to the left-speaking brain. When asked afterward what they saw, they could name only the claw. They knew nothing of the snow scene seen only by the disconnected right brain. The right brain does not speak.At this point in the test, the left brain actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the snow scene and in fact should have no idea why the left hand pointed to the shovel. Of course, the left brain knew why the right hand pointed to the chicken, since all of the brain processes involved in such act were part of the left brain.At that moment, his left brain was immediately confronted with a puzzle. Again, it knows why the right hand pointed to the chicken but why did the left hand point to the shovel? So, on the spot the left brain said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat one simple observation, now repeated dozens of time on several patients, revealed another special capacity of the dominant left brain. We called this device the \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterpreter\u00e2\u0080\u009d and have come to realize it is the storyteller, the system that builds our narrative and gives our many actions that pour out of us, frequently outside of our conscious control, a centrality, a story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our personal story. It is so powerful an addition to humankind that it masks the reality: We are, in fact, a confederation of relatively independent agents, each struggling to be part of our narrative that is our story. It turns out the left brain has another capacity potentially more important than language itself. The interpreter is the thing that sticks all of those parts together.It has been almost 37 years since we first made these observations, which is about a microsecond in evolutionary time. Still, it has allowed me to see connections with other ideas about humankind.III.In Graham Swift\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaterland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the narrator, a history teacher named Tom Crick, defines the human as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe storytelling animal\u00e2\u0080\u009d who \u00e2\u0080\u009cwants to leave behind not a chaotic wake, not an empty space,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomforting trail signs of stories: As long as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even at the moment of death, he says, we see our life rush before us as a story.Our ability to group events into a narrative could certainly help us feel better, could help us store the events as a single episode for later use, or could help us interact in a complex social setting. My threaded interpretation, however, could be different from yours. For stories (beliefs) to be useful as a technology to control groups of people, it is necessary to standardize our interpretations , something we know has occurred almost from the beginning of recorded human history. This is why the historian Yuval Harari, in his book \u00e2\u0080\u009cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has proposed that in addition to our personal narratives, we produce collective fictions that are a uniquely human capacity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe control the world basically because we are the only animals that can cooperate \u00ef\u00ac\u0082exibly in very large numbers,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd if you examine any large-scale human cooperation, you will always \u00ef\u00ac\u0081nd that it is based on some \u00ef\u00ac\u0081ction like the nation, like money, like human rights. These are all things that do not exist objectively, but they exist only in the stories that we tell and that we spread around. This is something very unique to us, perhaps the most unique feature of our species.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRead previous contributions to this series.Leon used to tell me he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe visual imagery existed because he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it. He hated scientific graphs and instead loved the densest mode of scientific presentations, a table of data. He was the most rationally driven man I have ever met and yet he could turn it off on a dime and talk about recipes for potato pancakes. When he was in his scientific mode, few could keep up with him. His capacity for abstraction was special and rare.Yet when Yuval Harari is talking about gaining control of people by the use of fictions, he is talking about the kinds of abstractions and ideas everybody can understand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 money, religion, politics and preferences, the kinds of things an interpreter is at work on all day long. As the novelist captures the personal, the historian captures the social story within which most of us are embedded and uniquely thrive. It is the inventive interpretive mind first applying itself to our personal life and then to our social existence that is our core skill. Once humankind realized it possessed this technology, we seized on it to thrive in and control our niche on earth.Back to Brussels to catch the return flight home. Another eight hours of Camels, backgammon and Scotch, but this time feeling a sense of success. In the taxi from Kennedy Airport we were going through Lower Manhattan and Leon suddenly said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you ever had pickles from Katz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Delicatessen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The driver quickly doped out what was to follow. I waited in the taxi idling on Ludlow Street while Leon went in to buy two containers of pickles.It is that big canvas of human history we had experienced on our trip, and this ever so small one, existing at once, that makes humankind so wonderful.Michael S.

Dan McKinney was 62.Ms. McKinney was 59 and retired from her work as a medical assistant, although she was taking on occasional work to make a little extra money. Her husband was getting ready to retire from his post as a restaurant manager at the Ritz Carlton Club at the Aspen Highlands Ski Resort in Colorado.No one is ever prepared for such an event. But for many women, the road to financial hardship begins after their husbands die. Nearly a third of single women over age 75 are living in poverty, according to Wiser\u2019s research.Ms. McKinney is not one of them. The couple had some savings, and she was the recipient of his $150,000 life insurance policy. Nonetheless, the sudden loss turned her world upside down. \u201cHe carried my heart on a velvet pillow, and I was crushed,\u201d she said.\u201cSome women are heads of households and managing it all,\u201d Ms. Howard said, \u201cbut probably 75 percent of women I\u2019ve worked with just go, \u2018I am not good at math.\u2019 It is not a matter of being good with math, I tell them. You can use a calculator. You just need to be comfortable talking about it.\u201dMs. Howard urged her client to increase her financial literacy. \u201cThat education is vital to getting your feet back on the ground,\u201d she said.Like most widows, Ms. McKinney is living on a lot less than before her spouse died. \u201cThe big-picture look at widows is that there\u2019s almost always a loss of income,\u201d said Cindy Hounsell, the founder and president of Wiser. Women also generally live longer than men, making it even more important that they plan their finances carefully.For reasons she still doesn\u2019t fully understand, two weeks after her husband\u2019s sudden death, Ms. McKinney headed back to the travel trailer dealership to pursue the dream she had with her spouse. She bought a 15-foot Sportsmen Classic.\u201cI took off for three months, driving a circle around Colorado,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to places in the wilderness and on the top of mountains, where I could stand outside and scream at the sky, and scream at God for taking my man. And scream at him for leaving me.\u201dSince her husband\u2019s death, Ms. McKinney has put tens of thousands of miles on her truck and trailer. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of driving, but I haven\u2019t done anything exorbitant,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go around the world.\u201dOne stumbling block for many widows is knowing where the money is. That often requires some sleuthing to locate savings accounts, brokerage accounts and retirement plans \u2014 and identifying the proper online passwords. \u201cThe first step to piecing things together,\u201d Ms. Blayney said, \u201cis digging out your joint tax returns for the past five years.\u201d\u201cAn ounce of prevention is everything,\u201d Ms. Blayney added. \u201cAnticipating widowhood is tough, but the more financial information a woman can gather in advance of the loss of a spouse, the smoother it will be.\u201dThat\u2019s easier said than done \u2014 even when the death is not sudden. Five years ago, Joyce McCue, now 63, and her husband of 30 years, Richard, moved to McLean, Va., from Memphis for his job as vice president for Hilton International. Six months later, he learned he had throat cancer. He died a year after their move at the age of 55.Her spouse had a $2.5 million life insurance policy. But when it came to what to do with it and other family investments, she was at a loss. \u201cI was always totally bored when we went to our financial planner,\u201d Mrs. McCue said. \u201cI controlled the day-to-day finances. I paid the bills. I balanced the checkbooks. But he did the big-picture stuff.\u201dShe did have one thing in her favor: She knew how to control her spending. \u201cRichard and I always teased each other,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my motto was always \u2018Do we need that?\u2019 and his motto was \u2018Let\u2019s get two.\u2019 \u201dShe hired a financial adviser, Eileen O\u2019 Connor, co-founder of Hemington Wealth Management in McLean. \u201cIt was quite intimidating,\u201d Mrs. McCue said. \u201cI felt like I was asking questions a kid in high school would.\u201dAnd, like Ms. McKinney, she joined a women\u2019s support group. \u201cWidows are able to share and help each other with the challenges they\u2019re facing and resources,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWhile I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m helpful to my widowed clients, I think they find as much support, or more, from peers that are going through the same ordeal.\u201dMost financial planners suggest that widows refrain from investing or spending any lump sum insurance or pension payout for at least six months and ideally a year. Some widows, however, overspend early after the death of a spouse.That\u2019s one mistake Ms. McKinney made. \u201cIf I had it to go over again, I would not take that life insurance in one lump sum,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have had it divvied out. You\u2019re not thinking that first year.\u201dAmong other things, she gave some large gifts to her adult children. \u201cSomehow it felt like it might soften things, ease the pain \u2014 however irrational it is,\u201d she said.An even more important decision is where to live. \u201cThat\u2019s an emotional one because the family home is often the locus of the marriage,\u201d Ms. Blayney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a financial decision; it is a very emotional decision.\u201dMs. McKinney waited a year to sell the couple\u2019s 1,700-square-foot home in New Castle, Colo., which sold for $260,000. \u201cAfter I came back from my trip, I never moved back in,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized I was living in my camper on the front curb and using my house as a really expensive laundromat. I didn\u2019t love the house anymore.\u201dAfter paying off the mortgage and upgrading to a 250-square-foot travel trailer, she had $63,000 left. \u201cFor now, I draw from that for living expenses,\u201d she said, \u201cso I don\u2019t touch my retirement savings.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re a hoot,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to have something joyful to look forward to and there they were.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Self? It Depends", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "A cynic might conclude that this is yet more evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as though any more were needed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that the abstract speculations of philosophers have nothing to do with the lived reality of daily life. But there is a more charitable and also more credible explanation. We have different conceptions of the self the world over not because selves differ, but because at different times and places people have more or less concern with different aspects of selfhood. They provide different answers to the question \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the self?\u00e2\u0080\u009d because that apparently singular question in fact contains any number of different ones.Both these explanations for the coexistence of radical difference and fundamental sameness seem extremely plausible when it comes to ideas of self. Take perhaps the most commonly noted, broad-brush feature of the Eastern conception of self: its relationality. Whereas in the West the self is understood primarily as an autonomous ego whose existence is distinct from that of others, in the East, it is often argued there is no meaning of self that is independent of our relations to others. The self is irreducibly social.Evidence for this is legion. There are more than a dozen different words for \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Japanese, and which one people use depends on the precise social circumstances.Read previous contributions to this series.All of this is no doubt true, but we misunderstand what it means if we see it as indicating a wholly other idea of self to that which holds in the West. That would be to fall prey to a kind of exoticization, the source both of xenophobia and romantic idealizing of the foreign Other. Many identities are relational in the West, such as those of parent, child, group member and so on. What we think of as different notions of self are largely a matter of differences in what aspects of self are expressed where and when.Why then is it that different aspects of self receive greater or lesser emphasis in different cultures? The answer is, I think, primarily ethical. Conceptions of self are usually assumed to be attempts to describe the objective reality of what a self is, and this is indeed what thinkers around the globe have often thought they were doing. But philosophies of self are usually at least as prescriptive as they are descriptive. For example, thinkers like Confucius knew that people could choose to live in isolation as rugged individualists. Living without relationality is perfectly possible; it just isn\u2019t good. There would still be some self living such a life but it would be an impoverished, emaciated one. Differences between conceptions of self are therefore more ethical than metaphysical.Hence these Eastern accounts of self do not so much provide a rival set of answers to the questions asked in the West as suggest that there may be other questions worth asking. If we want to know what it is which underpins the continued identity of a self over time, for example, it seems to me nothing from the East threatens the account offered in the tradition of Hume and Locke, in which psychological continuity is the bearer of selfhood. The question posed by a fruitful engagement with the East is whether this continuing self is best sustained by its own resources alone or its engagement with society and with others.Western philosophers have never been completely blind to these questions. William James explicitly talked of the social self. Generally speaking, however, they have played down relationality and emphasized individuality. Many in the West now question this, wondering whether we have become too atomized, too discrete. Eastern ways of thinking about the self are a resource for thinking about how we might change this.As the West rethinks the importance of relationality, it also needs to think which relations matter most. At the moment this looks decidedly under-thought. We worry about \u00e2\u0080\u009cbowling alone\u00e2\u0080\u009d and about diminishing social cohesion but are the relations that can fix this the ones of family, friends, neighborhood, community, nation, social media, interest groups or religion? Comparative philosophy shows us that there is more than one possible answer, and perhaps others that no great tradition has yet given.There are also other gains to be had from cross-cultural philosophical encounters. First, there would certainly appear to be some value in at least understanding the often implicit philosophies that inform populations, benefits for both observers and those observed.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.For instance, although Confucianism has deeply affected the Chinese outlook, after decades of official disavowal of his philosophy, many even in China do not realize just how instinctively Confucian their thinking is. Cross-cultural philosophy can therefore be not just a way of understanding the cultures of others but of our own. This is particularly important as countries begin to be affected by foreign values. In Japan, for instance, aspects of Western individuality are becoming more apparent with some studies suggesting that tradition, service and abrogation of self are less valued by youth. (Although it should be noted that laments for the passing of old values are as old as those values themselves.)We should be careful, however, that an atmosphere of ecumenical respect does not prevent real interrogation. To learn from other traditions one has to see the bad as well as the good. The downside of less emphasis on individuality, for instance, can be an excessive deference and a consequent lack of energy against injustice. When self is defined relationally, that can also make it more constrained by society and less flexible. That perhaps in part explains the relatively high suicide rate in Japan. North Korea is an even starker reminder of how the relegation of self can be a tool for terrible things.We might also consider the value of Confucian harmony in politics, as Daniel Bell urges us to do in his recent book \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe China Model.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harmony is found when our social relations are good, and to be good they require openness about disagreement and conflicts of interest. Harmony is not an aspiration for bland uniformity. As Bell points out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the most famous lines in the Analects of Confucius \u00e2\u0080\u0093 known to most educated Chinese \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is that exemplary persons should pursue harmony but not consensus (or uniformity).\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe different conceptions of self in different cultures matter so much because they are so subtle. If they really were staring us in the face we would know how to deal with them. When people speak a foreign language, for example, you either need to get an interpreter or learn it. But when people hold slightly different assumptions, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to miss what is critically different. And if we miss that, we not only cut ourselves off from others, we also cut ourselves off from useful ways of thinking about how we live.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Those days seem as distant as the time when shell-top Adidas and shearling coats were in style. But images from that era form the core of a new collection acquired by the Smithsonian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Obtained from Bill Adler, the writer and former music industry publicist, they offer a survey of hip-hop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s golden era, reflecting its energy, style and fun (although it also includes some images taken in the 2000s). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe culture has morphed and changed as things do over time, but these pictures speak to the grass roots nature of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rhea L. Combs, the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curator of film and photography. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the special quality of this collection. It touches on all of those important moments that are kind of nostalgic: You had jams, you had concerts, you had street ciphers. It included not just the M.C., but the D.J., the dancers and graffiti artists. This collection epitomized a nice constellation of these important moments of a very real and American moment in history.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Adler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in these images \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which were collected during his time running Eyejammie Fine Arts, a hip-hop photo gallery in Chelsea in the early 2000s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reflects a longstanding interest in documenting the music that interested him. In college, where he was a young music critic for the Ann Arbor Sun, he began tracking down photos and other information about the acts he would be reviewing. At record stores, he realized, there were publicity photos, posters and other items that too often wound up in the trash. He soon began to scoop them up.He already had material on some hip-hop artists by 1984, when he went to work for Russell Simmons as director of publicity at Def Jam records. In that job, he was able to commission photographers to make images of the label\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acts.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI also had my historian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Adler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would keep a copy of everything we produced. I had been doing some of that before, but I started doing it intensely while working for Russell.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe images in the collection are done by a range of photographers, including Janette Beckman, David Corio, Ricky Powell, Michael Benabib and Harry Allen. From studio portraits to candids back in the neighborhood, some of them portray a certain ease, intimacy and trust. In some you see artists like Queen Latifah as they first took the scene; KRS-One with his then-wife Ms. Melodie; the Beastie Boys goofing around or Run-DMC posing with the Eiffel Tower in the background.Some images still have the power to surprise, like a shot of Big Daddy Kane getting his hair shaped up before going onstage (Slide 2).\u00e2\u0080\u009cI love that one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Adler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed like the kind of photo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see in Life magazine a generation ago, so everyday but also exalted in a way.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat everyday nature spoke powerfully to Ms. Combs, who grew up in Detroit listening to the music of many of the artists in the collection.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was my generation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Motown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who I am. When I think about my youth, I think about getting dressed listening to \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bonita Applebum,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reading Vibe magazine cover to cover. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of my identity. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a language that helped shape my language and the lens through with I understand the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat lens was just as much influenced by Russell Simmons, who Mr. Adler said had a keen understanding of the music and its roots. He said that while Motown had its singers take pointers on how to dress and talk as a way to appeal to mainstream audiences, Mr. Simmons insisted that hip-hop culture did not need to be toned down.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe made it clear to me that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just rap music, but a whole culture from a super-creative community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Adler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA generation after Motown, Russell thought we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to water down that culture in order to cross over. In fact, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do what we do at full strength and pull the mainstream in our direction. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cross over to them.

The way the F.B.I. wants Apple to do that is by writing some new software that bypasses a bunch of safeguards Apple created to help consumers\u2019 phones stay safe in the first place. That is a thing that, for many reasons, Apple does not want to do.The whole thing is fascinating, as it cuts to the heart of so many issues in a rapidly changing age of new technologies, one in which we must decide the balance between our personal right to privacy and digital liberties, and the authority of the government to seek out information in the name of national security.But while I imagine it will take quite some time for the courts to pass judgment, I\u2019m already seeing some fairly clear lines in the sand being drawn. As a token tech reporter living and working in New York, the questions that most normal, nontechies have been asking me is, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Apple care about finding the terrorists? Why is the company acting so anti-American?\u201dThat\u2019s starkly different than what I hear from most people in our industry, but I\u2019d love to hear your take on it and what you\u2019re hearing from people on the West Coast.These questions make me really queasy. What about you?Seriously, though, of course all those things make me nervous. Do I want the government to access my text messages with you? Man, that would look bad.So when the company bound its own hands, I have to ask: What did it expect the government to do, just sit back and say, \u201cOh, well, I guess we won\u2019t request any more data.\u201d Of course not. This is an escalation in a continuing war for reach into consumer data, and now it\u2019s going to court.I think, in general, people don\u2019t want the government snooping on their data. However, I think this is perhaps the absolute worst case Apple and others chose to push back on, considering that it includes questions of terrorism and the mass slaughter of innocents. Tracking down terrorist ties to murderers is far easier for normal, nontechie people to comprehend than the intricacies of software and data extraction.Anyway, I expect this will continue on into our next set of trust falls in 2017. Till then, I\u2019ll continue to nurse my bruises and watch the case.Advertisement"}

Ms. Garner also made an endorsement video that included footage of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death on a Staten Island sidewalk.

Tales from her turbulent time at the helm of Hewlett-Packard, a job from which she was ultimately fired, began emerging, further hurting her campaign. And the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., similarly turned attention from her to some of her rivals who claimed stronger national security credentials.Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s crowds dwindled, and she was never able to recover, winning just 4 percent of the vote in New Hampshire after getting just 2 percent in Iowa. She was left out of last Saturday night\u2019s debate, missing out on free television exposure because there was no undercard debate.In her statement, Mrs. Fiorina also highlighted her status as the only woman in the Republican field, offering a message of feminism.\u201dTo young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others define you. Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you\u2019re a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not feminism.

The board would spin off Yahoo itself and, for good measure, said it would consider \u201calternatives.\u201dBut only a few months later, the board has again shifted course, this time initiating a full-fledged process to sell the company. An independent committee of the board has been formed, and lawyers and three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 have been hired. Even the hiring of three banks shows the bloat at Yahoo as it searches for someone to lead it somewhere.The company says that this is only one option, but independent committees have a life of their own. The train has started and it will probably stop at a sale.Moreover, it is nearly impossible to run a turnaround plan when you are actively exploring a sale and are contacting bidders. The board knows this, and so the talk of a sale being \u201conly an alternative\u201d is cheap.It\u2019s exactly what a weak board would do at this time \u2014 throw its hands up, despite the possible value of waiting.This is a result in part of the failures of Ms. Mayer. A rock star hire, one of her ideas was that Yahoo could be a top-tier player again if it acted like her old employer, Google. That meant spending billions of dollars on acquisitions, giving employees free food and free iPhones, sponsoring the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and throwing multimillion-dollar holiday parties.All of this would be fine if you are Google or Facebook and are minting cash. But it seemed wrong for Yahoo to again sponsor the World Economic Forum this year. You may suspect that many at the forum were looking at the Yahoo executives and thinking that this would be their last year there. What a waste of money, and what bad public relations.All this would make it hard for any board to maintain control. The default, of course, is to pull the ripcord. I had thought that the Yahoo board was taking a stronger stance by trying to buy a year with the Yahoo spinoff, but the board has buckled under pressure, with a potential proxy contest from the hedge fund Starboard Value looming.Yahoo\u2019s bankers will now call the usual subjects and run an auction. This typically takes about one to two months, although given the fact that everyone knows the situation here, it may go more quickly.During that time, indications of interest will be received and the field will be narrowed to a few bidders. Private equity players will undoubtedly bid, but so will strategic ones like Verizon, which bought AOL.Yahoo is likely to sell for less than all of the money Ms. Mayer spent. If she had sought to liquidate Yahoo as soon as she took over and distributed the proceeds, Yahoo shareholders would have fared much better than they will now.Whatever the outcome, Ms. Mayer will be able to parachute out of Yahoo with a big paycheck \u2014 more than $28 million, according to company\u2019s last proxy statement, although a decline in the stock price will make this less. And that is on top of the more than $100 million she has already earned at Yahoo for her years there. The notion of pay for performance loses out once again.This does not mean that an agreement of the Yahoo board to sell the company is the end of the Yahoo story. Some hedge funds like SpringOwl are likely to oppose a sale as insufficient. Other funds like Starboard are salivating for a sale. Indeed, Starboard is likely to try to unseat the Yahoo board in a proxy contest, if only to make sure the board does not again change its mind and decide not to sell.So the next fight to come at Yahoo will be whether the company is selling too cheaply.It all brings to mind a truism on Wall Street, that once you are at the mercy of financial engineers and schemes, it is over.

{"Headline": "Rivals Chase Donald Trump Into Nevada Caucuses", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "The Republican caucuses in Nevada have gotten almost no attention, especially in contrast with the consequential Democratic contest in the state last weekend. But the Republican version on Tuesday presents another opportunity for one of the remaining candidates to restrain the wind at Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. The public polling that is available in the state is scant, and it is not considered particularly reliable, in part because officials are not expecting a huge turnout. But Mr. Trump, who owns property in the state and is widely known there, is expected to win. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, however, has a good chance to come close to Mr. Trump or win the state outright, something he has been unable to do in the first three contests. Mr. Rubio spent a portion of his childhood in the state, and he may be able to capture the interest of some voters there. The candidates have not signaled much about their expectations in the state, and most campaigns are already looking ahead to the Super Tuesday contests on March 1. As for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, he will be looking to move beyond the fuss over the resignation of his communications director, who spread a video on social media that misrepresented comments by Mr. Rubio about the Bible. By firing the aide, Mr. Cruz guaranteed that many more people learned of the event, just a week before voters in Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home state of Texas head to the polls.

Local authorities are strained to the limit. Billions of euros have been spent with no end in sight. Many people came in whose identities are unknown; they have to register if they want handouts, but some have not and there are security concerns. Cologne has become a byword for concern over how a large influx of Muslim men will affect the place and security of women in German society.Three important state elections loom next month. It seems inevitable the far-right Alternative for Germany Party will surge. Merkel will be blamed. Her support has already tumbled. One poll this month showed 46 percent of Germans support her, compared with 75 percent in April last year \u2014 and that\u2019s with a strong economy. She could be vulnerable if her Christian Democratic Party turns on her. Europe without Merkel will sink.So why did this customarily prudent chancellor do it? Because she is a German, and to be German is to carry a special responsibility for those terrorized in their homeland and forced into flight. Because she once lived in a country, East Germany, that shot people who tried to cross its border. Because a united Europe ushered Germany from its darkest hour to prosperity, and she is not about to let the European Union pitch into mayhem on her watch \u2014 as it would with more than a million ragged refugees adrift. And, yes, because she has a heart.Merkel did the right thing. The question now is how she handles the consequences. Management involves setting limits. After taking in more than one million refugees last year, Germany cannot take in that number again in 2016. As Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, said recently: \u201cA limitation strategy may even be both morally and politically necessary in order to preserve the state\u2019s ability to function.\u201d He added, \u201cIf democrats refuse to talk about limits, they leave the field open to populists and xenophobes.\u201dBut setting limits is not a just a German issue. It\u2019s a Syrian issue. It\u2019s a Turkish issue. It\u2019s a Russian issue. It\u2019s an American issue. It\u2019s a European issue. Merkel needs Europe to have a functioning external border if it is to remain borderless within the 20-plus-nation Schengen zone. Otherwise national borders will go up. The European Union will unmake itself. \u201cNo European border, no Schengen!\u201d Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Gauck\u2019s chief adviser, told me.Merkel\u2019s domestic dilemma demands international answers.She needs the Syrian war, the main source of the refugee outflow, to end, but the latest American-Russian plan for a cessation of hostilities almost looks more likely to unravel in the weeks ahead than hold. She needs Turkey, in exchange for billions of euros, to tighten its borders and stop the refugee exodus. But Turkey is playing an extortion game, and is not above a little schadenfreude at seeing the Europe that rejected it fray.In Russia, she needs President Vladimir Putin\u2019s cooperation, but his strategy is the undermining of a united Europe; a \u201cweaponized\u201d refugee flow achieves just that. Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, declared in Munich this weekend that, \u201cWe are rapidly rolling into a period of a new cold war.\u201d He asked: \u201cIs this 2016 or 1962?\u201d Around Aleppo, a world war in miniature unfolds.Merkel needs the United States to exercise its power in a way President Obama has refused to do through the inexorable spread of the Syrian crisis. Unless the United States is prepared to establish a safe area in northern Syria and put pressure on Turkey to turn a chaotic refugee flow into an orderly process, the current untenable situation will persist. If America is unprepared to reverse Russian-Iranian gains in Syria, it must at least show commitment to managing the consequences. She needs European countries like Poland and Hungary \u2014 recipients of huge injections of cash from the European Union \u2014 to snap out of their ungrateful moods of nationalist xenophobia, but that\u2019s not going to happen soon.The European idea has not been this weak since the march to unity began in the 1950s. Germany is awash in so-called Putinversteher \u2014 broadly Putin sympathizers like Schr\u00f6der \u2014 who admire him for his strong assertion of Russian national interests. Michael Naumann, a former minister of culture, told me: \u201cThe United States has left us, we are the orphaned kids in the playground, and there\u2019s one tough guy, Putin. It\u2019s really that simple.\u201dGermany is Europe\u2019s core, its dominant power. If Merkel\u2019s refugee gambit implodes, the reverberations will be felt everywhere. The country feels restive, placid on the surface, tense beneath. A woman told me of how a 15-year-old Syrian refugee was admitted to her daughter\u2019s class. The girl\u2019s cellphone rang, the ring tone was a muezzin\u2019s call to prayer, and the teacher burst out: \u201cSo next you\u2019ll have a suicide belt!\u201d There was embarrassment all around, apologies and parental letters. \u201cThe situation\u2019s out of control,\u201d the woman said.At the Berlin state office for health and social affairs, a sprawling maze of buildings, white tents have gone up. Long lines of refugees make their way through the various bureaucratic hurdles to identity cards. They huddle in the rain, their sneakers muddy, their jackets too flimsy for the cold.Mustafa Dilaneh left Latakia, Syria\u2019s main port, in August, and paid $6,000 for his passage to Germany. He has been granted German residency until Feb. 22; he hopes for a passport after that. He is learning German. He wants to return home, but first, he says, President Bashar al-Assad \u201cmust go or die.\u201d Failing that, he has a dream of America. \u201cI love New York so much,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe city no sleep.\u201dA Facebook friend taught Dilaneh that phrase. This is the world\u2019s first massive smartphone coordinated migration. Syrians don\u2019t see the West as alien; they know it through countless images, brands and tunes. But for some Germans, these Middle Eastern refugees are an alien threat.I went out to Nauen, a small dismal town near Berlin where unemployment is high. Signs brandished at rightist demonstrations last year said, \u201cNauen will stay white.\u201d In August, a gymnasium that was to have housed refugees was burned down in an unsolved act of arson. The charred skeleton of the building with its blackened pillars and piles of rubble still stands. It cost about four million euros to build and will need at least that amount to replace.A new emergency center for several hundred refugees is planned nearby, with a view of this stark symbol of hatred. To say Nauen is combustible would be an understatement. \u201cThere will more protests,\u201d Volker M\u00fcller, who works to promote intercultural understanding, told me. \u201cIn some ways this feels like a bigger problem than German reunification.\u201dThe scale of Germany\u2019s challenge is evident at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, built to last by the Nazis, and used in 1948 and 1949 for the Berlin Airlift that, at its height, saw American C-47s landing every 90 seconds to bring the supplies essential for the preservation of freedom in part of the divided German capital. Now the vast 52-foot high hangars are being converted into shelters for thousands of refugees who sleep, 12 to each screened white rectangular bedroom unit, where aircraft were once housed. Already there are 2,600 or so refugees; there may eventually be 7,000. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to find a place for them,\u201d Sascha Langenbach, a spokesman on Berlin social issues, told me. He predicted another 60,000 may come to the capital this year.I spoke to a couple of young refugees from Aleppo, Mahmoud Sultan and Mulham (he preferred not to give his family name out of concern for his family\u2019s safety). They complained about the food, about the noise, about the difficulty of studying German, about how weeks stretched into months at this \u201cemergency\u201d center.They had not wanted to leave Aleppo. But, as Mulham put it: \u201cYou have this hope the war will end. For one year, two years, three years, you keep this hope. You think, I owe my country something and I will stay. Until in the fifth year you realize there are five wars! The rebels against Assad, ISIS against the Free Syrian Army, the Saudis against Iran, the Kurds against ISIS, and Russia against America! And you lose hope.\u201dThe refugees did not leave because they had a choice. They left because they concluded they had none. Merkel, given her personal history and her nation\u2019s, had little choice but to take them in.Now she needs those five wars to abate, and Western allies to come together with something of the resolve that Tempelhof symbolizes, if she is to calm a strained Germany, hold Europe together, and survive. That will require leadership and determination of a kind she demonstrated but that is in short supply in the social-media echo chamber of our times.This column has been updated to reflect news developments.

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Defends Welfare Law From Bernie Sanders\u2019s Attacks", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Repeatedly saying that the law did \u00e2\u0080\u009cway more good than harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton, in brief remarks to The New York Times, offered a striking contrast to his fiery outbursts against Barack Obama in South Carolina before the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary eight years ago. Back then, Mr. Clinton sharply defended himself and Mrs. Clinton from attacks by supporters of Mr. Obama, comments that upset many African-American Democrats who liked the Clintons but were supporting Mr. Obama.With Mrs. Clinton in far better political shape heading into the South Carolina primary on Saturday than she was in 2008, Mr. Clinton surely saw less need to lace into Mr. Sanders. But his care with his words was notable given the harshness from Mr. Sanders, who said on Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had rounded up votes for a welfare bill that, in his view, harmed \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, in pushing back against Mr. Sanders, noted that during his presidency, median incomes for African-Americans rose sharply and the poverty rate declined; a record number of African-American-owned businesses opened; and the homicide rate for African-Americans tumbled. But he bemoaned cuts in federal subsidies to state assistance programs, which had been promised stable financing in the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened was, the people who still needed some assistance didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were able to restore virtually all the cuts to legal immigrants that the Republicans demanded, we kept the guarantee of nutrition and health care. But the law needs to be changed to help the poorest of the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that it did far more good than harm, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that subsequent events showed it needs some improvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, who never mentioned Mr. Sanders, made his comments after a campaign rally here where he barely mentioned the Vermont senator, instead offering a glimpse of a general election argument that Mrs. Clinton might make against Donald J. Trump. Mr. Clinton took issue with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political tagline, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d saying that America is a strong country that needed to do more to help people of all races and incomes, from struggling coal miners and small-business owners to African Americans and police officers who are divided by a lack of trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think America ever stopped being great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have to make America whole again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton told a couple of hundred supporters in Rock Hill, a modest-size city near the North Carolina border.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we make America whole again? Well, we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build a wall around this country. We should do what Hillary wants to do. We should tear down the barriers and build ladders to prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile Mrs. Clinton has been decrying \u00e2\u0080\u009csystemic racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the criminal justice system ahead of the South Carolina primary, where more than half of Democratic voters are likely to be black, Mr. Clinton took a different tack here. He praised police officers generally and said that communities needed \u00e2\u0080\u009cneighborhood councils\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other groups that would build closer ties with beat cops and law enforcement officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to put more police on the street that look like the communities they are policing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know that anytime people have a lot of guns, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violence, and drugs are being sold, once in a while something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not pass judgment on who was to blame in such incidents, but focused instead on the need for the police and community officials to work together.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need the police, we need the police, but we need a police that people trust are on their side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.Throughout his speech, Mr. Clinton seemed to be reaching out to white voters at a time when Mrs. Clinton is explicitly courting African-Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Clinton said the government needed to do more to help coal miners whose livelihoods were being threatened by the steady decline in coal production. He called for making greater high-speed Internet broadband available in \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery small town in rural America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would lead to new job opportunities for miners and others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose coal miners in West Virginia didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey kept the lights on for decades, their children fought in our wars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Referring to miners as \u00e2\u0080\u009cour brothers and sisters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added that people of all races \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeserve the chance to begin again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sounding a little like Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whom he never mentioned by name \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mr. Clinton also called for tougher enforcement of trade deals and a tougher stance against China on currency manipulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to say, \u2018Look, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play us for suckers anymor\u2019e,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.The former president also drew strong applause when he backed President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutional authority to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court after the recent death of Antonin Scalia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should do his job and put up somebody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Clinton repeatedly praised Mr. Obama while also noting that many Americans still had not rebounded with the improving economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes 10 years to fully get over a financial crunch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. Referring to Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address last month, Mr. Clinton continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe painted this beautiful picture of the future, but the problem is, a lot of Americans are staring at this picture but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find themselves in it. Hillary is running for president to put every single American in that picture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Ties Hillary Clinton to Poverty Caused by Welfare Reform", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat welfare reform did, in my view, was to go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, during that period. I spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable. Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 strongly supported it and worked hard to round up votes for its passage.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders said that since the legislation was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled. He said that if elected, he would work to reverse that trend.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we are going to do in this country if I have anything to say about it is to say if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person is not going to live in poverty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said , adding that he would raise the federal minimum wage to $15. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday the minimum wage of $7.25 is nothing less than a starvation wage.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a statement, Ms. Harris added, \u201cThe original intent of welfare reform was to advance this progress, and it was done with a package of reforms.\u201d She  cited the Earned Income Tax Credit, a federal tax credit for low- and moderate-income working people, job training and child care, \u201cso people would have the tools they needed to find work and take care of their families.\u201dMs. Harris went on to explain the welfare reform law\u2019s shortcomings, like the five-year lifetime limit, which she said Mrs. Clinton has pledged she would work to address going forward. \u201cWhen it comes to lifting more African-Americans out of poverty,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cit has been Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has put forward bold plans to create good-paying jobs, dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline, and remove barriers to sustainable home ownership.\u201dMr. Sanders on Wednesday also promoted his plan to create a single-payer Medicare system for all, and said that providing health care would take \u00e2\u0080\u009ca huge bite\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of poverty. Looking ahead to the next nominating contests, he said he expects to do far better than people expect in the race and that thinks he has a good chance to pick up more delegates than Mrs. Clinton as the race goes on.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Uber Drivers Up Against the App", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe want to show Uber that without us full-time drivers, they won\u2019t have any cars on the road,\u201d Abdoul Diallo shouted from atop a concrete stage. Mr. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who has emerged as a leader of the strikes, was holding up his own sign: \u201cNo Drivers, No Uber \u2014 It\u2019s That Simple.\u201d\u201cThis is the formula!\u201d he hollered to the crowd.\u201cIn the beginning, your company was great for both drivers and customers,\u201d Mr. Diallo and his partners wrote this month in a letter to the service. \u201cYou treated drivers well and we loved you for that. Little did we know that it would be a short-lived momentary ecstasy that you used to lure us in in great numbers, just so that you can execute your plans and strategies toward world domination.\u201dUber, mostly through the voice of Josh Mohrer, the 33-year-old general manager of Uber New York, has said it is pained by the grievances of the drivers, who, while not employees of the service, are known as \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon. Like most tech operations, Uber has a data set for everything, and Mr. Mohrer said his numbers proved that January\u2019s price cut, like a steeper one two years ago, increased the demand for rides and therefore led to larger driver paychecks.\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive to think that lower fares will mean more money, but that is the reality,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added that he understood why the drivers might be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to say, \u2018Just trust us.\u2019\u201d\u201cUber treats its drivers however it wants,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones who do everything except provide the technology.\u201dA former import-export trader who studied for a business degree, Mr. Diallo, 29, has been driving for the company for three years in a $50,000 Chevrolet Suburban. At first, he said, the job was great: He could afford his lease and still make money because he was taking in as much as $5,000 a week.But in 2014, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent and not long after that it increased its commissions. Last year, it forced new drivers working for its luxury arm, Uber Black, to pick up passengers through its less expensive option, UberX. On top of this, Mr. Diallo claimed that Uber\u2019s aggressive hiring has flooded the city with too many drivers chasing too few fares.\u201cPeople can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Mr. Diallo said on the phone after a meeting to coordinate the New York actions with others in London and San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up $8 fares. They\u2019re driving their cars into the ground. Collectively, there\u2019s a lot of money coming in, but no one individual is making much.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it\u2019s literally unbearable.\u201dUber likes to say that its drivers, not its riders, are its customers. And while the company might not give its customers health care or a pension, it does provide them access to high-tech support centers, modeled on Apple\u2019s Genius Bars, where they can ask questions about commercial licenses, receive free medical exams or get a can of soda. Uber also helps its drivers negotiate leases with car dealers.Uber also disputes the claim that there are too many drivers in New York. There are still more taxi riders that the company could woo, and, according to Mr. Mohrer, after the recent cuts were made, trips in the Bronx and Queens, where many drivers live, went up by nearly 25 percent.But if all this data has the weight of scripture for Uber executives, it has been less persuasive to the drivers, who say the statistics do not fully describe the experience of working for the company. Though lower prices might increase their workload and thus their gross, they say, the increased revenue will be eroded by a corresponding increase in expenses.At the Super Bowl rally, a driver named Mustafa, who declined to give his last name because he feared reprisals from Uber, said he expected to make about $40 an hour after the cuts. But that was before he paid for higher costs of maintenance, gas and washes; for his car lease, insurance and sales and income taxes; for emissions inspections and the 2.5 percent of earnings he gives each year to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation; and, of course, for his commissions.\u201cWhen you put it together, the numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mustafa said. \u201cI\u2019m taking home less than minimum wage.\u201d\u201cWe stood behind them,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver who has worked for Uber for a year. \u201cThen they turned around and cut our pay.\u201dAfter speaking this month to an economics class at New York University, Mr. Mohrer acknowledged that when he first came to Uber, there were fewer drivers and stronger bonds between them and his management team. But as the fleet has grown, he said, he has tried to remain responsive to the drivers, who, on average, work 30 hours a week \u2014 or triple the rate of their peers in smaller cities.\u201cThey\u2019re more vested and engaged in Uber, so we take a more careful approach here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper relationship.\u201dBut deeper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean easier. A few weeks ago, Mr. Mohrer met with the leaders of the strikes at his office on West 27th Street in Chelsea\u2019s gallery district. He said they had a frank discussion about the rate cuts, which could be rescinded if the cuts do not achieve their goals. While he was not explicit about what those goals might be, he insisted that the conversation had been useful. \u201cI want to do this regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving drivers the opportunity to speak to me and my staff can result in more rapid change.\u201dThe strikers found the meeting less successful. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThey treated us like jokers.\u201d From his perspective, Mr. Mohrer offered no concessions on the cuts and was firm on only one position: that there would never be a tipping option on Uber\u2019s app.And that was the message Mr. Krasniqi delivered to the crowd in Queens on Super Bowl Sunday. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he reported on the meeting, then told the drivers to call their friends and relatives who also worked for Uber and urge them to stop driving.\u201cThat\u2019s how we built them up \u2014 with our friends and families,\u201d Mr. Krasniqi roared. \u201cAnd if we built them up, we can destroy them!\u201dIt is hard to tell at this point just how serious the threat to Uber from sustained unrest would be. The challenges of organizing a work force composed of men and women of disparate ethnicities and languages loosely connected by a cloud-based app are significant. \u201cIf the drivers can come together in a block causing problems, they might get something,\u201d said Evan Rawley, a professor of strategy at the Columbia Business School who studies the taxi industry. \u201cBut this is not West Virginia coal miners who all grew up together in the same small town.\u201dThere is a potential wild card: Class-action lawsuits have been filed against Uber, including in the federal courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco, which seek to make the drivers full employees. If the suits are successful, they could cripple Uber\u2019s business model, though some legal experts have said they are skeptical that the drivers could prevail when they use their own vehicles, and decide themselves when and whether to pick up passengers.\u201cThe solution is not to stay with Uber,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThe solution is to have our own platform \u2014 to build a real partnership and really be partners.\u201dFor now, however, they are still planning strikes, even if the one on Super Bowl Sunday was of questionable effectiveness. The drivers celebrated the action on their Facebook page, posting a screen shot of Uber\u2019s app that night \u2014 accompanied by the hashtag #SHUTDOWNSUPERBOWL \u2014 that showed a wait time at Kennedy Airport of 72 minutes.But the very next morning, Uber sent an email to its drivers announcing that the day before, it had broken its record for the most trips on a Sunday.\u201cThanks to you, our driver-partners,\u201d the email read, \u201chundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved safely around the city this weekend.\u201dA cover article this weekend about Uber drivers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the company misstates, in some editions, the percent of earnings that Uber drivers pay to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation. It is 2.5 percent, not 3 percent. And an accompanying timeline in some editions misstated the month and the year that Uber began UberPool, its carpooling service. It began in December 2014, not in July 2015.Advertisement"}

Our shows have been evolving to close this gap for some time. From livestreams to ordering straight from the runway to live social media campaigns, this is the latest step in a creative process that will continue to evolve.\u201dIn other words: The show will become a big marketing and selling tool, not for department stores or glossy magazines, but for direct communication between the brand and the men and women who want to buy it.That\u2019s kind of a big deal.47 PhotosA spokesman called the move one of \u201ccreative pragmatism,\u201d responsive to the fact that as Mr. Bailey is known to say, \u201cit\u2019s always summer somewhere in the world.\u201dAs an acknowledgment of the consumer demand for immediate gratification, the change is bound to send seismic shudders through the rest of the fashion world, which has been under increasing pressure to be more responsive to buyers\u2019 desires, and flexible in its scheduling.Other brands have been testing the idea with small capsule collections: Moschino also offers select pieces to buy straight from the runway, as does Versace. This season, Rebecca Minkoff is showing her spring line on the New York catwalk, as opposed to fall, which goes into stores in July and August, and which she will reveal by appointment only separately.But Burberry\u2019s global presence and reach \u2014 its more than 200 fully owned retail stores and similar number of department store concessions, its 5.9 million Instagram followers and over 17 million Facebook likes, its position as the only high-fashion member of London\u2019s FTSE 100 \u2014 have the power to transform consumer expectations, creating a knock-on imperative for other brands.Indeed, hours after Burberry\u2019s announcement, Tom Ford, who had been planning to hold a series of small presentations during New York Fashion Week, said all appointments were cancelled, and he would now show both his men\u2019s and women\u2019s Fall collections together next September, at the same time as the clothes were available to buy.\u201cShowing the collection as it arrives in stores will allow the excitement that is created by a show or event to drive sales and satisfy our customers\u2019 increasing desire to have their clothes as they are ready to wear them,\u201d Mr. Ford said in a statement.Meanwhile, Vetements, the buzziest new brand in Paris, told American Vogue that they were planning to move their show next year from the February collections to January, and would deliver the clothes on the catwalk the following month.Still, the move may not be so easy for every fashion house, especially in London.Though Burberry has the financial muscle and vertical integration to make this kind of switch (it owns many of its factories, and 70 percent of sales comes from its own retail network), smaller independent designers are dependent on wholesale partners for distribution, and such a relationship involves a six-month lead time between showing, placing orders and production. How they will adapt remains to be seen.Even Burberry does not appear to know exactly how it will solve all the issues created by being the sharp end of the spear of show change. If the company wants to be part of glossy magazine spreads featuring spring clothes, for example, but it doesn\u2019t show the spring clothes until the magazine is on newsstands, what happens then?Executives are banking on a buy-in from multiple stakeholders that will have a domino effect on the industry. The risk is they end up the odd man out in a system that is simply too entrenched to change.The new look show will be unveiled in September. There\u2019s a season to try to figure it out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Republic Is Sold", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byChris Hughes, the owner of The New Republic, said on Friday that he had sold the magazine to Win McCormack, a publisher and editor based in New York and Portland, Ore., who founded the literary quarterly Tin House.Mr. McCormack will appoint Hamilton Fish, the publisher of The Washington Spectator and a former publisher of The Nation, to be publisher and editorial director, The New Republic said.Mr. Hughes, a Facebook founder whose tenure at the magazine was marked by turmoil, including the resignations of multiple employees protesting his decision to replace its top editor, signaled an intention to sell last month. Mr. McCormack\u2019s and Mr. Fish\u2019s backgrounds in journalism and progressive politics, he said, \u201cmake them uniquely qualified to lead such a historic institution. I look forward to watching their progress over the years to come.\u201dThe Washington Spectator is a nonprofit liberal publication that, its website says, reports \u201con the excesses of the public and private sectors that distort our politics and undermine democracy.\u2019\u2019Mr. McCormack, an active Democratic fund-raiser, is the author of a book that details the sexual indiscretions of Republican politicians who espouse family values. Mr. Fish, who also produces documentary films, comes from a long line of Republican lawmakers. In 1988, he sought the Democratic nomination for the same Westchester County congressional seat his forbears had held, but was defeated.The magazine did not make Mr. McCormack, Mr. Fish or Mr. Hughes available for interviews, or disclose the terms of the sale. But Mr. McCormack said in a statement that he intended to stay true to The New Republic\u2019s traditions and preserve \u201cthe journal as an important voice in a new debate over how the basic principles of liberalism can be reworked to meet the equally demanding challenges of our era.\u201dThe sale caps a troubled four years at the helm for Mr. Hughes. When he bought the magazine many hoped that the combination of his Silicon Valley experience and the storied history of the publication \u2014 which has published George Orwell, Virginia Woolf and Philip Roth, and has a reputation for producing talented editors and writers \u2014 would prove formidable.Instead, a new chief executive he installed clashed with the magazine\u2019s editor, Franklin Foer. When word got out in late 2014 that Mr. Hughes had decided to name a new top editor, Mr. Foer resigned and was followed by a dozen staff employees and dozens of contributing editors, forcing The New Republic to cancel an issue.In a letter last month announcing his intention to sell, Mr. Hughes said that he had spent more than $20 million on the magazine, but had \u201cunderestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today\u2019s quickly evolving climate.\u201dShortly after Mr. Hughes released that letter, the magazine\u2019s current top editor, Gabriel Snyder, posted a message on Twitter saying that the magazine\u2019s staff was \u201cfocused on what we do every day: trying to make great journalism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unions Say a Majority of Their Members Support Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton has proven herself as the fighter and champion working people and their families need in the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the statement, which was embraced by several large unions, including the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the American Federation of Teachers, and the Service Employees International Union. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is why, of all unions endorsing a candidate in the Democratic primary, the vast majority of the membership in these unions has endorsed her.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe statement is partly a reaction to the aftermath of the announcement by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of unions, that it would not vote during its executive council meeting this week on whether to endorse a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries, essentially postponing an endorsement until the primaries are no longer competitive.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have concluded that there is broad consensus for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to remain neutral in the presidential primaries for the time being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, said in an email to union officials last week.Supporters of Mr. Sanders argued that the decision not to hold an endorsement vote reflected substantial enthusiasm for him among rank and file union voters, even within unions that had already endorsed Mrs. Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say over all that union members are divided,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders and past president of the Communications Workers of America.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant given where we were last spring that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now at a point that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is not coordinating a campaign in the primaries, that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would essentially be encouraging members to be active for whichever candidate they support.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut leaders of prominent unions backing Mrs. Clinton say this is a misreading of the federation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe A.F.L.-C.I.O. virtually never endorses in primaries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the 1.6-million member American Federation of Teachers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now a story where there should not have been one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 certain people in the Bernie camp wanted to take advantage of it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the unions that endorsed Hillary want to make really clear to people that we are incredibly supportive of her.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed Vice President Al Gore in October 1999, shortly before he competed against former Senator Bill Bradley in the 2000 Democratic primaries. It endorsed Senator John Kerry in February 2004, after Mr. Kerry had piled up victories in more than a dozen contests, including the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and appeared on his way to the nomination though he still faced a challenge from Senator John Edwards. (Mr. Edwards finished unexpectedly close to Mr. Kerry in the Wisconsin primary shortly before the federation\u2019s endorsement that year.)To win an endorsement, a candidate must get the support of unions representing at least two-thirds of the federation\u2019s 9.3 million members. Mrs. Clinton was roughly one million votes shy of this total at the time the federation decided to abandon the process last week, according to two sources briefed on the decision.In addition to the problem of basic math, these sources said, at least one president of a major union supporting Mrs. Clinton urged aborting the process out of fear that pushing forward with a vote could be divisive. Others worried that a vote could divide the labor movement more broadly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do believe it would not be beneficial to push the issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lee Saunders, president of the 1.6-million member American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, or Afscme, which has also endorsed Mrs. Clinton and was part of the joint statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone will have to come together when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Democratic candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn truth, both sides have evidence to back up their claims about the state of the race among union voters. Mrs. Clinton has the endorsement of 23 unions, versus three for Mr. Sanders, and the unions that have endorsed her represent more members than all the unions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. (Some large unions, like the two-million member Service Employees International Union, are not part of the federation.)Exit and entrance polls from the Iowa and Nevada caucuses showed voters from union households favoring Mrs. Clinton over Mrs. Sanders by a roughly 10-point margin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 greater than the margin by which Mrs. Clinton won those contests overall.Still, that 10-point margin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 assuming it is correct, which is not necessarily assured \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may reflect a narrowing of the gap between the two candidates among union members since last fall. In the three polls that Afscme conducted between last May and October, more than 60 percent of its Democratic members consistently backed Mrs. Clinton, versus no more than 20 percent who backed Mr. Sanders.It is impossible to know the margins by which members of specific unions voted for Mrs. Clinton in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early primary contests, but other evidence suggests significant pockets of support for Mr. Sanders. The Afscme council in Washington State endorsed him in January, and a prominent service employees union local in New Hampshire endorsed him in November.Ms. Weingarten suggested that some of the blame for confusion about the level of labor support for Mrs. Clinton resided with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which she said had given the impression that a Clinton endorsement might be imminent in the run-up to this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting, and to a similar meeting last summer.She pointed out that many unions were increasingly forming ad hoc alliances outside the federation to work on key issues, like pensions and the ability of unions to collect fees from nonmembers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe traditional role the A.F.L. is supposed to have is marshaling all this energy, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing it, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis in some ways is just more of that. Frankly I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised the A.F.L. put itself in position, both in July and now, where they were creating an expectation that was never there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

Mr. Trump has swept three straight contests, after all, and Mr. Rubio is positioned as the party establishment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice to take him on.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doubt that the media will do everything they can to frame the race as anybody but the proven conservative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said, growing a bit irritated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you know, to win the nomination, you actually have to win states.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "U.S. Soccer\u2019s Rebranding Gets an Assist From Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingBut when it finally came time to unveil the new crest, the federation, the national governing body for soccer, elected to largely bypass the traditional news media. Its announcement on Monday will instead be delivered directly to fans via a more immersive experience \u2014 one that involves Google Cardboard, a virtual reality promotional video and a United States Soccer Federation scarf.The federation is hoping that this unorthodox approach will help draw more attention to its first major rebranding since 1995. It could also become a case study of sorts on the effectiveness of virtual reality as an advertising and marketing tool, particularly for sports leagues that are experimenting with different avenues to connect with fans.\u201cThis is an area that I think is still in a really unique phase,\u201d said Jay Berhalter, U.S. Soccer\u2019s chief commercial officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not really sure what it will end up being. But when we looked at it to launch the new crest, we thought it would be a really good fit for this type of dynamic.\u201dU.S. Soccer planned to surreptitiously deliver packages containing the gifts Monday morning to the doorsteps of about 8,000 registered club supporters as well as an additional 2,000 development academy players and other soccer fans across the country. The official unveiling will be later in the day.Shel Holtz, a public relations consultant and principal of the firm Holtz Communication & Technology, said that by doing something unusual, U.S. Soccer might be able to get away with bypassing the normal P.R. route. He likened it to Ford\u2019s effective use of Facebook to unveil its new Explorer model in 2011.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of content these days, a lot of noise,\u201d Mr. Holtz said. \u201cBut as long as you can be early with some of the new technology people are talking about, then you have an edge.\u201dThe approach also echoes what rugby did in the days leading to its World Cup in September, when New Zealand\u2019s national team, in collaboration with American International Group, created a virtual reality experience that it gave away to 1,000 fans. Joe Favorito, an instructor in strategic communications at Columbia University who consulted on the project, said that effort significantly helped raise awareness of the event.\u201cYou want people to get genuinely excited about something, and you want to do it in an atmosphere that they can embrace,\u201d Mr. Favorito said. \u201cSometimes the best way to do it is literally to drop it on their doorstep.\u201dHe says sports entities have used guerrilla marketing tactics in the past \u2014 the Los Angeles Galaxy, for instance, mailed packages with branded goods such as sunscreen to fans \u2014 but virtual reality adds another layer.Mike Gressle, U.S. Soccer\u2019s director of marketing, said that the organization considered the demographics of its fan base before choosing virtual reality.\u201cOur fans are pretty early adopters to technology,\u201d Mr. Gressle said. \u201cGiven that this is the next new thing, we think they\u2019ll be pretty interested in it.\u201dThe rebranding effort is centered on the crest. Crests are like logos for soccer federations, and they are treated reverentially by soccer enthusiasts. The old mark \u2014 which included a flying soccer ball at its center, a rippled top, and six blue stripes below a red field \u2014 was ridiculed as dated and cartoonish. The new one is not unveiled until the end of a two-minute virtual reality highlight reel, which was shot by StriVR and contains 360-degree video from the most recent men\u2019s national team game and the women\u2019s World Cup.Mr. Berhalter said the rebranding and unveiling added up to one of the costliest marketing efforts in the federation\u2019s 102-year history \u2014 reaching seven figures and far outpacing a standard news conference unveiling that might cost around $30,000.\u201cWe kept on coming back to the notion that the press conference isn\u2019t really something that drives the fan experience,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore we\u2019ve moved away from that to something that is more immersive and interacting and experiential for the fan.\u201d(Of course, the federation also reached out to The New York Times in hopes of publicizing the new crest through a more traditional avenue.)The soccer federation enlisted Nike, its sponsor since 1995, to help formulate the look of the new crest. The process began in the fall of 2014 and involved several hundred iterations.The new look is more streamlined, featuring a squared upper limit and 13 vertical stripes (seven red and six white) below a dark blue field containing the block letters U.S.A. The design evokes U.S. Soccer\u2019s original crest from 1913, yet, according to Mr. Berhalter, it conveys an identity that is more modern, aggressive and patriotic.In the days leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, U.S. Soccer scrubbed the previous logo from its website, social media and even the doors of its headquarters in Chicago.First to go from the older crest were its three stars, said Garret Drexler, U.S. Soccer\u2019s fan services manager. Stars traditionally signify World Cups won by that nation, and the United States men\u2019s team has won none (the crest for the women\u2019s team, which has won its World Cup three times, will keep its stars).\u201cI think there\u2019s been a pretty good segment of our fans that have long hoped for an updated identity,\u201d Mr. Drexler said. He added: \u201cOur crest means a lot to our fans. To change it is no small thing. We took a lot of time to make sure we got it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019re going to think, who\u2019s this band coming out of nowhere?\u201dA straightforward guitar-driven group somewhere between the Black Keys, Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, Highly Suspect began as a bar cover band playing songs by Sublime, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd. In 2011 the group relocated from Cape Cod, Mass., to Brooklyn \u2014 a scene where Highly Suspect, which also includes the twin brothers Rich and Ryan Meyer on bass and drums, didn\u2019t quite fit in. \u201cThere was nobody bringing that harder sound,\u201d Mr. Stevens said.Pete Giberga, a 300 executive who courted the band, said of the signing, \u201cWe looked at it with a great deal of humility \u2014 we were putting out a rock band in 2015, and that can be a long road.\u201d\u201cMister Asylum,\u201d which was released last summer, has sold about 34,000 copies to date, the label said; \u201cLydia\u201d has more than 110,000 paid downloads and 3 million YouTube views and has been streamed nearly 10 million times on Spotify. The band counts around 39,000 fans on Facebook.Highly Suspect\u2019s competitors for the Grammys, however, dwarf those numbers many times over. For example, Mr. Bay\u2019s \u201cHold Back the River\u201d and Ms. King\u2019s \u201cEx\u2019s & Oh\u2019s,\u201d both nominated for best rock song, have a combined 113 million views on YouTube and more than 250 million Spotify streams.While industry insiders say that labels and publicists often hire consultants to strategize on reaching the most Grammy voters, executives at 300 denied making any special push for Highly Suspect. \u201cWe\u2019re a small, independent company with no resources, so to do self-aggrandizing efforts like that \u2014 \u201d said Mr. Cohen, trailing off. He also invoked an unprintable line from Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D diminishing the importance of the awards.Todd Moscowitz, another 300 executive, said, \u201cUnequivocally, nobody was hired by this company or anyone else as far as I know to lobby\u201d for a Highly Suspect Grammy nomination. He added, \u201cI wish I knew how that works \u2014 I would do it for every one of my artists.\u201dBill Freimuth, a senior vice president at the Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammys, said that his organization had done \u201can awful lot of outreach in the rock community\u201d over the last year, leading to nominees that are younger and more \u201cindependent-minded.\u201d (\u201cMister Asylum\u201d was distributed by Warner Music Group, which is also represented in the rock album category by Death Cab for Cutie\u2019s \u201cKintsugi,\u201d Muse\u2019s \u201cDrones\u201d and Slipknot\u2019s \u201cThe Gray Chapter.\u201d)But Paul Grein, a music journalist and Grammy forecaster for more than three decades, said that while awards politicking in the music industry may occur far less than in Hollywood, business relationships do matter. For Highly Suspect, he said, \u201cthe only explanation is they aggressively whipped every vote that might possibly be coming their way into action.\u201dAnd although the Recording Academy warns voters not to be influenced by personal friendships, sales data or regional preferences, \u201cif your friend is nominated, it\u2019s hard to put that aside,\u201d Mr. Grein said. As for Highly Suspect\u2019s chance of winning, he added: \u201cFor them to be nominated was the achievement. They would be greedy to be disappointed.\u201dThe band\u2019s label seems to agree. \u201cI feel like they\u2019ve already won by getting nominated,\u201d Mr. Giberga said.That doesn\u2019t mean the awards were ever too far from Mr. Stevens\u2019s mind, albeit as a long shot. While recording \u201cMister Asylum,\u201d the lead singer recalled, he would joke to his band mates: \u201cAll right, guys \u2014 this one\u2019s going to the Grammys.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the distributor of \u201cMister Asylum.\u201d It is Warner Music Group, not Universal Music.Alec M.

{"Headline": "Debate Could Serve as Final Bulwark for Donald Trump\u2019s Rivals", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Donald J. Trump will take the stage Thursday night at the CNN-Telemundo debate in Texas with a new title: three-time winner. The stakes for many of the debates have been high, but none so high as this one. It represents one of the final chances for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida to produce a galvanizing, breakout moment. And it is the last chance for Senator Ted Cruz, whose home state of Texas votes on Super Tuesday next week, to try to fend off Mr. Trump there. The evening is not risk free for Mr. Trump, who has benefited enormously from the previously crowded Republican debate stages, where Mr. Cruz went after him only once, and where, with the exception of Jeb Bush, the candidates basically left him alone. If Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio do not engage Mr. Trump directly, it will lead to more questions about why no one, for all the establishment complaints about the real-estate developer, has tried harder to stop him. But Mr. Trump may also face tougher questioning. Mitt Romney, who sought Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement in 2012 but has grown critical of his candidacy, also essentially volunteered a question to the debate moderators on Wednesday. Mr. Romney went on Fox News and, just as Senator Harry Reid of Nevada did to him in 2012, wondered what might be hiding in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns. It is a question Mr. Trump might not like facing on a debate stage. Also worth watching is how Gov. John Kasich of Ohio approaches Mr. Rubio. Mr. Kasich has grown increasingly critical of Mr. Rubio this week, after running a sunny race for most of the primary. But Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides have all but demanded Mr. Kasich drop out of the race, a suggestion the governor has not taken kindly.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Dropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSo what\u2019s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\u2019s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.\u201dOther numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the company\u2019s service \u2014 a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers \u2014 and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropbox\u2019s revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the company\u2019s annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\u201cDropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever \u2014 like LinkedIn or Salesforce,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we couldn\u2019t be thrilled with that kind of performance.\u201dBut if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world \u2014 the trend toward business software that doesn\u2019t stink, known as the \u201cconsumerization of information technology,\u201d and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropbox\u2019s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s. When Dropbox visits a company\u2019s chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show \u2014 a large base of the company\u2019s employees who are already using its service.\u201cWe fish in a pond that\u2019s used to our product,\u201d Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropbox\u2019s potential for profit was more attractive than Box\u2019s, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, disputed this assertion. \u201cOur differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers,\u201d he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\u2019s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.An earlier version of this column misstated the fees Dropbox charges its business customers. The fees are about $150 annually for each of the business\u2019s employees, not for each business.Advertisement"}

When refugees began streaming onto the island, a Dutch couple decided to pair them with tourists for conversations about the journeys that brought them there.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine enjoying a holiday getaway in an area rife with suffering. But it happens all the time, and not just in the developing world where verdant, gated resorts exist not far from impoverished shantytowns. Consider the Greek island of Lesbos, where sunbathers laze by azure waters while not too far away boats arrive daily full of families fleeing violence in Syria and other hot spots.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLesbos is an interesting place because there are tourists and refugees coming to the island and they are both there for a week or two,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Brink said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we came up with the idea to ask refugees and tourists to sit down and talk to each other and make a film out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe knew that people had to wait there for hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. van der Velden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask them when they were coming off the boats.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. van der Velden and Mr. Brink paired up migrants and tourists for interviews in spots throughout the island.

But the situation changed and there was nothing more for me to do. Everything in my life stopped.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen Ms. Pabst asked him to name those dreams and ambitions, he told her that when the war in Syria started (around five years ago), he had just graduated from law school. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to work as an attorney,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war put an end to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMohamad, a Kurdish, 50-year-old former restaurant manager from Aleppo who spent two years in Turkey before arriving on the island, was paired with Jan Winkel, 56, from the Netherlands. Mr. Winkel often looked surprised by Mohamad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe trip was relatively safe, because I was nearly killed three times in Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamad said, adding that his wife and son were still in Turkey and his daughter in Syria.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to hear this story from you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Winkel replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you think everything is torn up and we are here with the entire family.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt the end of each session, Ms. van der Velden took portraits of the pairs, which she let them stage.

There are plenty of rites-of-passage for girls as they begin and complete puberty. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the bat mitzvah, the quincea\u00c3\u00b1era and the Sweet 16. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read about a beautiful Apache ceremony called Na\u00e2\u0080\u0099ii\u00e2\u0080\u0099ees, which usually takes place the summer after a girl has her first period and commemorates the story of Esdzanadehe, the first woman. It originally lasted a few days, during which a girl, covered with a golden mixture of cornmeal and clay, became imbued with the power of the first woman and received the ability to heal and bring blessings to her community.I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a Sweet 16 or a bat mitzvah. But I did have a First Holy Communion, which supposedly marked my ascent to the age of reason, as a 7-year-old. As rituals go, it was a good one.First, there was the buying of the white dress, white fake fur jacket and white shoes. I recall my mother and me marching up and down Ashland Avenue, the main shopping street in our South Side Chicago neighborhood, in search of something that I would actually deign to wear. It couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be too ornate, according to Sister Eleanor, the principal of St. John of God grammar school, but according to me it had to be really, really pretty. (Twelve years ago I actually found the dress as I was cleaning out my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, and it really was pretty: sateen with sheer puffy sleeves and seed pearls all over the bodice.) As we shopped around, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d run into other girls and their mothers doing the same thing. Seeing them and comparing notes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoldblatts ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 good no more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gougin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 everybody over by 63rd\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 heightened the feeling of the ritual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance.The ceremony, on a May morning in 1968, bordered on the pagan: All 60 kids marched slowly, piously, in a procession toward the church, led by the pastor and assistant priests, with altar boys shouldering a large statue of the Virgin Mary on a wooden pallet, her head wreathed in white roses. The streets were packed with our parents, grandparents, godparents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles and neighbors, all snapping photos from behind police barricades. We were told by the nuns not to talk to, or even look at, anyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just keep our eyes focused on the kid directly in front of us, our hands folded in prayer. And yet at almost every step someone was yelling my name \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Uncle Bob, honey! I wanna take your picture!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSharon! Look at your mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs we turned a corner, I could, for the first time, hear the booming sounds of the church organ and the choir. I remember thinking that that was a magical moment: all of us walking toward the thunderous organ playing just for us while the choir of adults sang us in to the tune of a hymn called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Is My Body.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA group of teenage boys stood with their arms folded, watching us; a young mother crouched, put her arm around her little boy, and pointed; an old man doffed his cap. As we walked up the steps of the church, the nuns, like security at a rock concert, waved back the mothers with flowers and dads with cameras. It felt like we were the Beatles.Now I wonder: Why is it that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lauded and celebrated when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only just embarked on the journey? Why do we stop marking, ritually, the accomplishments along the way? The hurdles that we overcome?I think all of us women who are going through menopause should gather together and then two-by-two make a pious procession through streets clogged with our living loved ones and long-dead parents and grandparents (resurrected just for us and calling our names). Whoever we are, whether svelte and wafting Chanel or pouchy with pendulous breasts, I want us to be made much of, cheered, recognized. I want our procession to be led by a bunch of men our age with beer guts pushing their shirt buttons apart, shouldering a statue of whoever our appropriate goddess is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly Coatlicue, an Aztec Earth Goddess, or maybe Hillary Clinton.I want us to be sung to by a choir as we march into a secular temple, possibly some combination of the old Fillmore and the Society for Ethical Culture. Once inside, we gather in a circle around a huge ring of fire and, at an appropriate moment, accompanied by chanting, we reach into our purses and toss into the flames that unused old tampon that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been carrying around for five years. As we do, the fire changes from red to pure white, tongues of it leap into our hearts, and we receive the ability to heal and bring blessings to our community.And then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a party afterward that lasts four days, with enough ice-cold drinks, Ativan and L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Occitane Verbena Refreshing Towelettes (chilling in hundreds of tiny personal refrigerators) for us all.\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfSharon Mesmer teaches creative writing at NYU and the New School and is the author, most recently, of the poetry collection \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreetings From My Girlie Leisure Place.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPrivate Lives: Personal essays from writers around the globe, on the news of the world and the news of individual lives. \nMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

I wished I had asked him something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Valde, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, recalled in a phone interview Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I speak up and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you take care of the Mark Gaffneys of the world?\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cMark never had health care until Obamacare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to replace it with?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz, during a back-and-forth, expressed condolences, while also deriding the law as a job-killer that has made insurance premiums \u00e2\u0080\u009cskyrocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Valde and his wife, Jill, Mr. Gaffney\u2019s sister, attended a Bill Clinton rally on Sunday and chatted with Mr. Clinton in the rope line, with the former president telling them that he had heard about the question posed to Mr. Cruz. The Valdes said they were surprised by the attention, with word of the exchange getting back to Mr. Gaffney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends hundreds of miles away.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends saw it in Arizona, they said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thanks for bringing it up,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Valde said.  Mr. and Mrs. Valde said in the interview that before the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Gaffney had been either uninsured or lightly insured, making it prohibitively expensive for him to see doctors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was having financial problems and the last thing he could do was pay to take care of himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Valde said. \u201cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say: \u2018It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too expensive.

By summer, he told them that he had terminal cancer, and he died on Aug. 16 at age 58.The Valdes said that they did not believe that earlier access to the health insurance necessarily would have saved Mr. Gaffney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, but that his plight convinced them that the access to coverage he ultimately obtained would be important for others. They were grateful, they said, that Mr. Gaffney was eventually able to see a doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about people like him? Mr. Valde said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople could be saved.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of Mark Gaffneys out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Nielsen Plays Catch-Up as Streaming Era Wreaks Havoc on TV Raters", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byDennis Cheatham said he felt as if he were receiving a message from the past last May when a package arrived in the mail from Nielsen asking him to participate in the survey that for decades has detailed the television viewing habits of Americans. \u201cI just kind of shoved it in there and wrote Netflix wherever I could,\u201d said Mr. Cheatham, 40, a professor of graphic design at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. \u201cIs Nielsen not paying attention to technology? Don\u2019t they notice that something has changed?\u201dMr. Cheatham is not the only one asking that question.The stakes are high. Some $70 billion in advertising dollars are traded in the United States each year based on Nielsen\u2019s ratings, and hundreds of television programs live or die based on that viewership data.Chief among the complaints about Nielsen is that viewers across the country like Mr. Cheatham and his family are streaming billions of hours of video on outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, but that their behavior is not being captured in industry ratings based on Nielsen data.\u201cThe TV ratings system as we know it is outdated,\u201d said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie analyst.Nielsen executives promise that they are paying attention and are ready and able to track the myriad ways people consume media. They also underscore that paper diaries are deployed to measure viewing in local television markets, which account for a small part of the business, and that panels with more sophisticated electronic meters measure national viewing.\u201cWe\u2019re not arrogant about the landscape and about the needs of marketers and media companies and agencies to have better, more comprehensive data,\u201d said Steve Hasker, Nielsen\u2019s global president chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re much more focused on meeting those needs and executing against our road map than we are looking over our shoulder.\u201dFor a long time, the only real recourse television and ad executives had was to grumble. They still relied on and paid for Nielsen measurement because it was their main option.Whether any of the new players will dethrone Nielsen is unclear. Some industry analysts like Mr. Nollen and other executives said that because of its legacy, Nielsen remained best positioned to provide a single source of ratings data across TV and digital. Others question whether ratings will even be relevant in a not-too-distant digital future, when ads are bought and sold based on specific data about viewers, such as location, occupation, salary and purchases, rather than broad audience metrics.\u201cThe road is littered with the roadkill of companies that have tried to compete with Nielsen over the years,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, president of research at Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal. \u201cNow, some of these new entities might wind up being able to do things in a way that Nielsen can\u2019t. If they have figured out a better mousetrap, they could give the industry something to seriously think about.\u201dIn the last year, Nielsen has released 69 new products and technology innovations \u2014 most notably introducing a measurement called total audience metric to track TV viewing across video on demand, mobile and streaming.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Yet Nielsen is established on an inherent conflict that can impede the adoption of new measurement methods. Nielsen is paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by the television industry that it measures. And that industry, which uses Nielsen\u2019s ratings to sell ads, is known to oppose changes that do not favor it. \u201cPeople want us to innovate as long as the innovation is to their advantage,\u201d Mr. Hasker said.Some television and advertising executives have said that Nielsen has started to address their concerns. CBS, for instance, announced in September that it was working with Nielsen to measure viewers across streaming and mobile.Another major initiative from Nielsen was the expansion of its national television ratings panel, which deploys electronic devices to track minute-by-minute viewing. To capture more diverse and splintering audiences, the company increased its panel to nearly 41,000 households, or about 100,000 people, from 21,000 households. Again, some executives said that the change came too late. When it is possible to track the websites people visit, what products they buy and which shows they stream, advertisers say they are seeking much more detailed information.Mr. Hasker said that Nielsen was exploring ways to incorporate more digital data, like Facebook registration information and direct feeds from set-top boxes, into its ratings.The battle between the old and the new measurement establishment already is playing out across the local television market, which is measured separately from the national market. For years, Nielsen deployed its paper diaries to measure viewing. Rentrak entered the market and won a number of clients by offering an alternative: using the data from set-top boxes to measure what people are watching on the television. After closing its deal with comScore, the new company is expected to include more complete and accurate digital viewing data by merging Rentrak\u2019s television metrics with comScore\u2019s digital data. But even that new method is not perfect. Some critics point to holes in Rentrak data, stating that set-top box measurement does not represent the total population.\u201cWe have heard from our clients across the industry, and the message has been very clear: Measurement needs to evolve,\u201d Serge Matta, comScore\u2019s chief, said Monday in announcing the closing of the merger.Nielsen plans to phase out the use of unreliable television diaries \u2014 like the one Mr. Cheatham received \u2014 in the local markets where they are used and replace them with more accurate electronic devices. The decision, Mr. Hasker said, was not spurred by the competition but was made because \u201cusing paper diaries in an increasingly digital world is an incredibly difficult thing to explain and justify.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Makes Appeals to Black Voters in South Carolina", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "FLORENCE, S.C. \u2014 Hillary Clinton began a whirlwind day in South Carolina on Thursday by taking questions from some 400 African-Americans in Kingstree, where in 1996 President Bill Clinton attended a dedication for a newly rebuilt church that had been burned by members of the Ku Klux Klan.After a brief introduction touching on student debt, national security and gun control, Mrs. Clinton took questions. Ben McGill, a resident, said that his aunt and uncle, Martha Gilliard, 92, and Hogan McGill, 80, had been shot this week in Baltimore as they walked to a sandwich shop. He asked Mrs. Clinton to weigh in.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know we are a smart enough nation to figure out how you protect responsible gun owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights and get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton replied.She added that she would expand comprehensive background checks and close \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Charleston loophole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a federal provision releasing guns to buyers if a background check takes longer than three days. It is a provision, she said, that Senator Bernie Sanders supported.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the N.R.A. says things like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, you just need more people with guns so the good people with guns can take out the bad people with guns,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a 92- and an 83-year-old brother and sister and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking to the grocery store,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes no sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then transitioned to the shooting last year at a black church in Charleston that killed nine people.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a Bible study with people at your church and a young man comes in and asks to join in and the pastor and parishioners welcome him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as we are called to do in scripture, right? Welcome that stranger, he actually listened to the Bible study. Then an hour later he took out a gun,\u201d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer day in the state covered hundreds of miles, ranging from rural areas to the highly populated Myrtle Beach and Charleston.In Kingstree, Jannie Cooper, 69, a retired educator, and her friend Deloris Cooper, 55, a home health care worker, were in the crowd, each an ardent Clinton supporter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHillary has been here not only for black Americans, but for children and all of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jannie Cooper said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been all of her life fighting for our causes. Bernie Sanders is real good too. His heart is in the right place, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be able to do all the things he wants to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEach of them, however, agreed that while Mrs. Clinton appears to hold a solid lead among African-Americans in South Carolina, Mr. Sanders resonates with younger voters.A few hours later, at a Methodist church filled beyond capacity here, Mrs. Clinton was given a rousing introduction by Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and Senator Cory A. Booker of New Jersey. Mr. Gross criticized Mr. Sanders for voting against the Brady bill, for supporting 2005 legislation that shielded firerarms manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits, and for his support of \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Charleston loophole.Mrs. Clinton, sounding hoarse but appearing energized, repeated much of her earlier themes, drawing \u00e2\u0080\u009camens\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the largely black crowd. To loud applause, she praised President Obama for the Affordable Care Act, promising to expand it, and criticized Senate Republicans for refusing to consider any Supreme Court nominee from President Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat this Senate is doing, is in my view, a grave disservice to the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. After the event, Rhodes Bailey, 35, a Columbia public defender, and his wife, Dare, 33, a lawyer, both of whom are white, said they liked what they heard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her experience and intelligence and the ability to get it done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bailey said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were big Obama supporters. And Hillary, we just have confidence in her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like the Coopers, however, they said that their support for Mrs. Clinton did not mean they disliked Mr. Sanders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe love Bernie and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of been shunned by some of our more liberal friends, but the breadth of Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience on the issues is more important than sort of, the one note message that Bernie gives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bailey said. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Trigger Warnings", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byOpinionACCIDENTAL gun deaths are not all that common, but stories about them are.In a country of more than 320 million people and at least as many guns, a handful of such shootings every day does not amount to much, except of course to those involved. Even when they reach into the thousands, as they do most years, unintentional shootings are statistically invisible when viewed against other causes of death and injury.Yet the stories told of gun accidents echo far beyond each isolated shot. They are tales of misfortune and warning, recounted either as lamentations on the vagaries of fate, or condemnations of carelessness, with hints of schadenfreude when the shooter and the shot are one and the same. We rarely talk about them the way we talk about other accidents, with a wince or a shrug depending on how closely the lives affected resemble our own, but as fables with lessons to impart.The best examples of this are the worst to imagine.Just after Christmas in 2014, a young woman in Idaho visited a Walmart with her 2-year-old son. As they made their way through the aisles, the toddler reached into his mother\u2019s purse and drew out a legally concealed 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun. He then fired at his mother from near point blank range.Though it was just one of the more than 30,000 gun deaths in America that year, something about this shooting cried out for retelling around the world. Dozens of news reports across the country hit the same sad notes, while the hashtag #IdahoWalmart lit up Facebook and Twitter. Reports in Europe highlighted Idaho state legislation that expanded areas where concealed weapons would be allowed. In Australia, a correspondent ruefully observed, \u201cNormally when they handle a gun, very young children kill themselves or other children.\u201dIn their ordinariness, the facts of the shooting added up to something haunting. Here was a memento mori peculiar to our culture; a sudden recognition that guns now move through the American landscape with such ubiquity that even a family stroll through Walmart can end with a body on the floor.The story suggested that the question we collectively face is not whether the guns all around us will fire, but when.#IdahoWalmart was particularly ripe for spreading through social media, but the dark allure of gun accidents is not a creation of the digital age.BEGINNING in the 18th century, the colonial press compiled accounts of accidents with pistols, muskets and powder. The stories often took the form of gemlike narratives that captured the damage done in excruciating detail. The tradition of publishing these tales of death and dismemberment continued largely unchanged through the birth of the republic and beyond.Reading such reports now, they seem torn from the pages of hard-boiled noir. In the florid style of the day, a gunshot not only kills a man but puts a \u201cperiod to his existence.\u201d When one brother kills another during a hunting expedition, it must be noted that they \u201chad always lived in the greatest harmony together,\u201d or else suspicious readers might assume Cain and Abel had settled their score with buckshot.As often as the outcome of such violence was death, this was rarely the primary subject. Like contemporary accounts, reports of early American gun accidents were concerned most of all with the living, and with the precarious hold they have on the world.These historic reports have other things in common with today\u2019s. A majority of gun accidents were family affairs. Fathers shot daughters, mothers shot sons, husbands shot wives and, perhaps most frequently, brothers shot sisters. Accounts of the latter often described sibling mischief gone awry: Younger brothers pointed rifles playfully at older sisters, then came the discharge and the game was done.Given a somewhat limited range of dramatis personae, accident report writers were inevitably drawn to the same themes. Many took a remarkably similar interest in trajectory \u2014 in the paths traveled by projectiles as they intersected with human lives.A writer in 1801 described a single shot that passed through a man\u2019s hand, then his wrist, then his shoulder. A writer in 1838 noted how a charge entered a boy\u2019s head on the left side \u201ca little in front of the ear,\u201d before passing out the back of his head and continuing on. Seventeen years later, another report described a shot stitching through a crowd like a needle drawing scraps of fabric together: On its way toward the woman it wounded, it passed \u201cthrough the skirts of a young man\u2019s coat standing near,\u201d and then \u201ctore the dress of a lady who was standing behind.\u201dThe more grandiose chroniclers turned these accidents into a drama of the celestial spheres, as if guns and their victims were simply objects in orbit, powerless to avoid collision. If \u201cheaven sends misfortune,\u201d a poem quoted in a New York report from 1803 asks, \u201cwhy should we repine?\u201dAs tempting as it might be for gun-control advocates to view the plague of bullets that afflicted our forebears as proof of how little our gun-obsessed culture has changed, it\u2019s not that simple. To begin with, as the exploding firearms in many historical accident reports attest, guns themselves are much safer than they used to be.The relative safety of modern firearms may now be part of the problem, however. A mother who carries a gun as she shops with her children does so with the belief that it will be used when and how she chooses. The improvement of machines designed to kill has not broken the continuity between the past and the present \u2014 it has reinforced it by offering the false security of domesticating objects that will remain always half wild.Guns play many roles in the American imagination. They have been used to evoke liberty, tradition, crime and most recently stand-your-ground vigilantism. Their image is so embedded within us that even those who have never handled a weapon cannot help talking of shooting now and then. But what if the ways guns are usually spoken of \u2014 in politics, in entertainment, in conversation \u2014 do not reflect their most durable meaning?Though often seen as an embodiment of the nation\u2019s freedom-loving swagger, every gun comes loaded with an alternate history: not heroic self-reliance but hapless tragedy.Peter Manseau is the author, most recently, of \u201cMelancholy Accidents: Three Centuries of Stray Bullets and Bad Luck\u201d and \u201cOne Nation Under Gods: A New American History.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just hours before the attack, at a checkpoint near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, he posted on Facebook that \u201cthere is nothing worth living for on this earth as long as the occupation oppresses our souls and kills our brothers and sisters.\u201d He added: \u201cEveryday someone dies, I may be the next.\u201dHe drove up to the checkpoint and emerged firing a weapon, the military said.The attack was unusual because it involved a Palestinian official and a firearm, reported to be a handgun. Most of the attacks on Israelis and Israeli soldiers in the last four months have been with knives, and many have been carried out by young people under 25 years of age. Ynet, a leading Israeli news site, reported that a friend of Mr. Sukari said that he had been anxious about his debts.The Palestinian Authority and Fatah, the party led by President Mahmoud Abbas, have not endorsed this wave of attacks except to honor the dead as martyrs to the cause of Palestine. Hamas, the movement that controls Gaza, praised Sunday\u2019s attack.There was another similar attack in early December by a Palestinian Authority intelligence officer, Mazen Hassan Areiba, 37, who shot and wounded two Israelis near the Hizme checkpoint to Jerusalem before being killed. A married father of four, he was a relative of Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and chief negotiator for the Palestinians.Later Sunday, the military said a Palestinian attempted to ram his vehicle into soldiers north of Jerusalem. It said troops opened fire, wounding the man, who was taken to the hospital for treatment. On Saturday evening, a 17-year-old Israeli, a recent immigrant from the United States, was lightly wounded in a stabbing attack at Damascus Gate in Jerusalem. The police said they had arrested two suspects, both 15 years old.In the last four months, at least 26 Israelis have been killed and more than 155 Palestinians, most of them assailants, the Israeli authorities said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disappointed With Europe, Thousands of Iraqi Migrants Return Home", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Night after night, Mohammed al-Jabiry tossed and turned in his bed at a refugee center in Finland, comparing life in Europe with life in Baghdad. After many sleepless nights, he decided to come home.There were little things, too, that drove him to return, like the high price of cigarettes and the chillier weather. \u201cIn Europe, I was isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cLife in Europe was not what we were expecting.\u201dMany Iraqis have stayed in Europe, of course, especially those who were displaced from lands controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. And others are still risking everything to cross the seas to get there. Last week, the bodies of five Iraqis who drowned in the Aegean Sea were returned to Kirkuk in northern Iraq.The returnees largely reflect another segment of migration: those who left Baghdad for economic reasons, or merely out of curiosity after seeing so many reports of migrants arriving joyously on the shores of Europe.When Mr. Jabiry left last summer, he said, \u201cI was thinking, \u2018I have no job here, and I never finished school.\u2019 I thought of a better future there \u2014 that I would find a better job, that I could continue my studies, earn more money.\u201dHe added: \u201cI was crying the first day I arrived in Finland. Crying of happiness.\u201dAs the days stretched into months \u2014 time he said he mostly spent working out at the gym, or aimlessly hanging out with other Iraqis in the refugee center \u2014 he realized it would be a long time before he could get a job or a home of his own.Last summer, Facebook was filled with posts about making the trip. Now, some Iraqis in Europe are turning to social media to warn their countrymen away. One video posted recently shows an Iraqi man complaining of the food in Europe and saying, \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for my flight to Baghdad, and I will be back soon. I would advise everyone not to take the risk and come to Europe.\u201dThe International Organization for Migration said it helped almost 3,500 Iraqis return home last year \u2014 just a portion of the overall number coming back, as many do so with the assistance of local governments or Iraqi Embassies in European countries.\u201cSince early 2016, requests for more assistance are increasing,\u201d said Thomas Weiss, the organization\u2019s chief of mission in Iraq.The Iraqi government recently sent a delegation to Europe to organize the return of Iraqis, and it may send chartered airplanes to bring them back.\u201cThere are large numbers of Iraqi migrants who want to return from Europe,\u201d said Satar Nawrooz, the spokesman for Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Migration and Displacement. \u201cSome want to return for personal reasons, others because their applications for residency have been refused or because of the expensive living conditions. We are not able to count them all because a lot return on their own expense and not that of the ministry.\u201dMany of those returning to Iraq are also broke, having sold most of their belongings to pay smugglers to get them out of Turkey, on a dangerous sea voyage, to Greece.\u201cOur dream was to leave the country,\u201d said Haitham Abdulatif, 48, who sold his Mercedes for $8,000 to pay for the trip he took with his 10-year-old daughter. \u201cIt was the talk everywhere \u2014 on TV, on social media.\u201dMr. Abdulatif was an officer in Saddam Hussein\u2019s army, but after the invasion by the United States in 2003, and the subsequent policy of de-Baathification, he was left without a pension. Then he was caught up in tragedy, like most Iraqis: Three brothers were killed during the sectarian civil war. But he has an aunt and cousin who live in the United States, and their stories motivated him to think of life elsewhere.\u201cThey would always describe to me how living outside the country was different from living in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are comfortable. They are safe. There are job opportunities.\u201dHe arrived in Belgium with this in mind: \u201cI was expecting them to give me a house, a good job, so I could have a better life. This is what I was dreaming about.\u201dThe reality, he said, was much different. He quickly spent the $8,000 he brought, mostly paying smugglers, and found himself almost broke. He hated the food (milk and toast for breakfast, he said, and cheese sandwiches for lunch). And obtaining residency and finding a decent job would take months, he said. Finally, he went to the authorities and said, \u201cI want to go to Iraq.\u201d\u201cThey were surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I told them I\u2019d rather die in my country than die outside in a strange country.\u201dMany Iraqis, too, did not count on the difficulty of landing in a liberal, European society from a conservative Arab culture.\u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t live in an open society,\u201d said Aqeed Hassan, 26, who plays the clarinet and, back in Baghdad after going to Finland, is trying to get a job in a military band. \u201cMy wife has her head covered, and I didn\u2019t feel like they liked Arabs.\u201dStill, Mr. Jabiry said that at first he was treated warmly, though also as a curiosity.\u201cIn the early days when we arrived, the people were impressed with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were taking pictures of us, inviting us into their homes. They liked our brown skin and our dark hair.\u201d\u201cThey turned their faces away from us,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the Finnish people really didn\u2019t want us anymore.\u201dHe said he was not pushed to leave by the Finnish authorities, but he did notice signs that went up in the refugee center where he lived saying that Finland would pay for plane tickets to go home.Some Iraqis who returned had fond memories of their brush with European culture, and few regrets for trying a new life.\u201cIt was very green and clean,\u201d Mr. Abdulatif said. \u201cIt was beautiful. Even the people\u2019s morals \u2014 they all respected us. Everyone said \u2018bonjour\u2019 to me every morning.\u201cIt was 99.9 percent different from Baghdad. People here all talk in a sectarian way: He\u2019s Sunni, he\u2019s Shiite, he\u2019s Kurdish.\u201dHe added: \u201cI now consider the journey as something that was fun. I don\u2019t regret it.\u201dFalih Hassan, Omar al-Jawoshy and Ahmed Salah contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "A century ago, the Carrera S\u00c3\u00a9ptima, Bogot\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main thoroughfare, was bordered by the stately homes of the well-to-do. Like a European promenade, it led to the city center: grand municipal buildings, a towering cathedral, the expansive Plaza de Bol\u00c3\u00advar. Its electric streetcars were a symbol of progress, high in the Andes.Now, little remains of the S\u00c3\u00a9ptima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandeur. The old city was nearly reduced to rubble after a political assassination in 1948 sparked riots that left buildings ransacked and burned, the streetcars tipped over and torched. Those who could moved north, leaving the city center to fill with soulless office buildings and the indigent.But for eight months last year, Mr. Cobo visited a still-rough part of the area weekly, concentrating on four blocks of the S\u00c3\u00a9ptima that were closed to vehicular traffic not long ago. There, he mined for visible signs of a past often forgotten by Colombians in their eagerness to move forward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistoric centers interest me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Colombia, they are centers of forgetting.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cobo, 52, was born in Cali, Colombia, and studied film at New York University. Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Bogot\u00c3\u00a1 and worked as a cinematographer and commercial director. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA few years ago, I reached a point where I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand to do any more advertising,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we say in Spanish, I kicked my lunch pail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe embarked on a number of personal photography projects, including this one.Remnants of the past abounded on the S\u00c3\u00a9ptima, where the streetcar tracks were embedded \u00e2\u0080\u009clike scars\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the street. In one image, a man smoked on a bench in the spot where the populist leader Jorge Eli\u00c3\u00a9cer Gait\u00c3\u00a1n was killed in 1948 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 arguably the most important spot in Bogot\u00c3\u00a1, for were it not for that event, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe city wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been destroyed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cobo said.Mr. Cobo also spotted living relics of the past: older gentlemen in suits and ties crossing the street. Retired public servants and office workers, they lingered in the city center, walking alone or sitting in cafes discussing events from long ago. These men are the last of a type known as el cachaco, the quintessential Bogotano of the last century.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey come from the early 20th century when the British and European influence was strong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cobo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have a certain formality, a certain courtesy. They probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a place to sleep, or live in rented rooms, but they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out without fixing their tie and putting on their sweater and overcoat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also found plenty of what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009crebusque,\u00e2\u0080\u009d buskers and swindlers of all stripes: fortune-tellers, men selling emeralds, or offering to let him in on a deal. By the Plaza de Bol\u00c3\u00advar, vendors sold bags of corn to working-class Colombian tourists to feed the pigeons. A one-armed man did push-ups for change, his knuckles leaving a groove in the concrete from his 1,000 daily repetitions (Slide 18). A handful of Michael Jackson impersonators took turns dancing for coins, among them a 14-year-old who had fled Urab\u00c3\u00a1, one of the flashpoints in Colombia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decades-long civil conflict.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a very, very, very sad Times Square in a third world country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cobo said.Despite the details in his work that speak to daily life and the passage of time and history, Mr. Cobo said he did not consider himself a photojournalist. He wanted to stir feelings in the viewer. As often as he saw brokenness, Mr. Cobo said he sensed strength in his subjects. And he wanted to convey this.\u00e2\u0080\u009cColombia is a complex country, but very resilient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a spirit of resilience. The S\u00c3\u00a9ptima is a mirror of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
