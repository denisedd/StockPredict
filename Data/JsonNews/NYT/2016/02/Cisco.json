{"Headline": "At Blinn College, Cam Newton Plotted a Return to the Big Time", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThere is, as Newton discovered in 2009, nothing glamorous about playing football for Blinn. The locker room is small, dank and outmoded. The bleachers at Spencer Stadium, which he and his teammates were once tasked with painting in the kiln of an east-central Texas summer, were deemed unsafe, and removed in 2010. The Buccaneers now play at Brenham High School. Basic equipment is issued, but if players want visors, gloves or wrist bands, they must buy them.The modest facilities might have discouraged some recruits, and the town\u2019s remoteness \u2014 the approximate midpoint of the 165-mile stretch between Houston and Austin along Highway 290 \u2014 might have deterred others. But isolation and humility are what Cecil Newton valued when he began plotting his son\u2019s return to big-time college football.Like many community colleges, Blinn is a haven for talented players who arrive as reclamation projects, sometimes after running afoul of the law or lapsing into academic troubles. They roll in and out of town every semester as if on a conveyor belt, regaining good standing in the community and the classroom in pursuit of Division I scholarships. Among the other Blinn players to make it to the N.F.L. were receiver Quincy Morgan, running back Bernard Scott and cornerback Chris Johnson, who won a Super Bowl with Baltimore.Newton transferred here from Florida, where he had been arrested in connection with a stolen laptop and was facing another season backing up Tim Tebow. According to N.C.A.A. rules, Newton had to sit out a year before he could play for another Division I team. He arrived here without a car, a starting job or any immediate family within 850 miles.10 Photos\u201cHe had to come down to earth real fast,\u201d said Chad Froechtenicht, a teammate of Newton\u2019s and one of his close friends. \u201cHe had to say, \u2018Hey, how did I get here, and what do I have to do to get to where I want to go?\u2019 \u201dNewton perceived Blinn, a two-year community college with about 2,400 students, as a 12-month stopover between quarterbacking gigs \u2014 if he could endure it. On weekends, when there were limited food options on campus and much of the student body had fled, Newton and friends who remained would head to Arby\u2019s or Dairy Queen to flirt for food.\u201cGoing back to small town U.S.A., you\u2019re not under the big lights \u2014 that kind of slows you down a little bit,\u201d said Ronny Feldman, who was Blinn\u2019s offensive coordinator then.The campus, studded with live oaks, pecan trees and crepe myrtles, is so contained that traversing it takes four minutes. It sits about a mile from the archetypal Texas town square \u2014 a courthouse in the middle, ringed by bakeries and boutiques and sundry shops \u2014 and is a seven-minute drive from the unofficial ice cream of Texas, Blue Bell Creameries.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I wanted to get out of Blinn,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI think I just wanted that opportunity. When I was in junior college, I was mentally hurt. I needed to regain some confidence by playing the quarterback position, let alone football, because I hadn\u2019t played important downs in so long.\u201dNewton had few other serious options. From the outset, his father homed in on Blinn, where its coach, Brad Franchione, had already won a national title.The first time Cecil Newton called Feldman, Feldman did not recognize the area code and almost did not answer. What follows is an abridged version of their conversation, as recounted by Feldman.Cecil: \u201cCoach, this is Cecil Newton, Cam Newton\u2019s dad. You know Cam?\u201dFeldman: \u201cI apologize, Mr. Newton, but no, I don\u2019t.\u201dCecil: \u201cThat\u2019s O.K. He plays at the University of Florida and he\u2019s looking to transfer. Any way you could get some video?\u201dFeldman: \u201cI probably can.\u201d Pause. \u201cHoly moly.\u201dA few weeks later, in early January 2009, Franchione met with Cecil and Cam Newton at a Houston restaurant and outlined his plan for academic and athletic success.\u201cYou don\u2019t get a second chance to do this right,\u201d Franchione said. \u201cI knew that, and they knew that.\u201dOver dinner, Cecil Newton made Franchione promise three things.\u25a0 No interviews with the news media, which he upheld.\u25a0 Franchione would develop Cam Newton\u2019s leadership skills, which he did during daily discussions in his office.\u25a0 And under no circumstances did Cecil Newton want his son to become an option quarterback. He would be a dropback passer.At that early stage in the football calendar, coaches were permitted to oversee only conditioning and footwork drills, leaving players to organize anything involving a ball. After one workout, Franchione said, Cam Newton stopped in the doorway of the weight room, turned around and told the defense that he was headed to work with the receivers.\u201cDo you all think you can stop us?\u201d he said.Those types of challenges defined Blinn practices. Almost every day, Newton would bark at his teammates: \u201cDid you get better today? Did you get better that play?\u201dThey played tug of war with enormous tires. In each individual and team drill, the winners earned points for their unit; assistants kept score.Within a few days of Newton\u2019s arrival, about 60 players started accompanying him to the stadium for seven-on-seven games. But he still ranked second on the depth chart, behind Shaun Rutherford, who, like many players, knew little about their new teammate, who had thrown only 12 passes at Florida.\u201cWhen I first heard that we had a guy transferring in who was 6-4, 250 pounds,\u201d Rutherford said, \u201cI was like, that\u2019s not a quarterback, that\u2019s a defensive lineman.\u201dBut Newton had earned the starting job by the beginning of the season. Feldman devoted those first few months to Newton\u2019s passing fundamentals, to footwork and mechanics and progressions.During two-a-day fall practices, Newton logged every route, pass, completion, drop and bad throw into a notebook and, in film study, reviewed them with his receivers. If the data suggested that he was struggling with a particular route, he would focus on it the next day. Feldman would consult Newton\u2019s notes when scripting plays for that week\u2019s game.Newton demoralized opposing teams with his mobility and deflated them with his arm. He accounted for 38 touchdowns, including 16 rushing, while completing 60.7 percent of his passes and throwing only five interceptions. In one four-game stretch, Blinn outscored its opposition, 265-115, including an 84-13 rout of Cisco College that left the Buccaneers disappointed. They were hoping to score 90.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I would say Cam brought to our team \u2014 confidence,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cCam brought that swagger.\u201dNewton, in turn, said his time at Blinn gave him \u201cthe confidence that I needed that I still carry to this day.\u201dHe was known to stroll into huddles wearing a smile and saying something like: \u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to kick their butt. You with me or not?\u201d When Blinn\u2019s players dashed onto the field before home games, Newton often took a detour, running toward the far sideline to yap at the opposition.Some teams called Blinn to complain about Newton\u2019s antics, and Franchione is convinced that other coaches snubbed Newton from the all-conference team because they did not like him.The former athletic director David Rehr said Newton impressed the administration during a meeting held, he said, \u201cto see if he was apologetic\u201d about the laptop incident \u201cor if he was just another punk kid.\u201dAfter that, Rehr said, \u201cCam\u2019s name never came across my desk.\u201dThe title, Blinn\u2019s last in football, is commemorated on a scoreboard at a stadium where games have not been played in seven years.As a soft light bathed campus Sunday afternoon, two hopefuls ran sprints on the stadium grass. A few blocks away, at the intramural field that abuts a cemetery, another group practiced kicking field goals at the lone goal post.As the sun dropped, a crowd gathered, about 25 in all. There is little to do in Brenham, Tex., but catch passes and defend them, the players changing, the cycle repeating itself. Then the players retreated to their dorms to watch Pro Bowl highlights and play Madden and go to bed so they could do it all over again.Benjamin Hoffman contributed reporting from San Jose, Calif.Advertisement"}
