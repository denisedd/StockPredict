{"Headline": "F.B.I. Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201dHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201dIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tech Degrees Are Not Putting More Blacks and Hispanics Into Tech Jobs", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byConspicuously AbsentTechnology companies employ strikingly few black and Hispanic workers. They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there aren\u2019t enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs.Yet the data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. So why aren\u2019t they being hired?Those who enter the candidate pipeline fall out somewhere along the way \u2014 and the culture and recruiting methods of tech companies seem to have a lot to do with it.The pipeline problem is not a myth. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs, relative to their share of the population, while Asian students are overrepresented.But technical workers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter, according to the companies\u2019 diversity reports, are on average 56 percent white, 37 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic and 1 percent black.One issue is that black and Hispanic computer science and engineering graduates are less likely than white and Asian ones to go into tech jobs. Forty percent of young Asian graduates do so, compared with 16 percent of black graduates and 12 percent of Hispanics, according to American Community Survey data.Meanwhile, 10 percent of black computer science and engineering graduates have office support jobs, which include administrative support and accounting jobs, compared with 5 percent of white graduates and 3 percent of Asians.\u201cAny student of color looking at the numbers from the tech giants is going to be turned off and wary about taking a job there because it tells you something about what the climate is,\u201d Ms. Beasley said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the token.\u201dRecruiting is another issue. Part of it is looking not just at Stanford and M.I.T. but also at places like historically black colleges. Even at the colleges that tech companies typically recruit from, students who are not white or Asian might not be in the networks to know about opportunities at tech companies.Tristan Walker, a tech start-up founder and chief executive of Walker & Company, said he didn\u2019t know about Silicon Valley until he was 24 and arrived at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\u201cThere definitely isn\u2019t a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. \u201cThese folks aren\u2019t working hard enough, they\u2019re just not.\u201dWhen companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply don\u2019t show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But they\u2019re more likely to come to workshops, like for writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or preparing for interviews.\u201cThat gets a higher yield in terms of students showing up, and they leave with an impression that we value them and their growth, as opposed to it just being a sales pitch,\u201d she said.Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews \u2014 asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.\u201cThere\u2019s still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard,\u201d Ms. Powers said. \u201cThat does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview,\u201d because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.Some researchers offer other strategies: Use standardized interview questions, not subjective ones; evaluate hiring managers based on whether they bring in diverse candidates; build a Rolodex of potential hires by working with networking groups for minorities; hire more than one minority member in each batch of new hires, so they have a support network.Techniques like these could expand the pipeline for tech companies \u2014 and for any other industry, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Helping Homeless Artists Turn Around Their Fortunes", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byIn September 2014, Scott Benner, a former heavy equipment operator, was homeless, unemployed and staying at Father Bill\u2019s Place & MainSpring, a shelter in Quincy, Mass.Fending off a debilitating illness and depression, Mr. Benner spent hours making art, something he had done much of his life. His compelling pen and ink drawings enticed the Boston start-up ArtLifting to add him to its collection of homeless and disabled artists whose work was being featured and sold on its website.For Mr. Benner, 58, who lost his job in 2009 and despaired as his marriage broke up and he spiraled into homelessness, the solo show in Boston served as a startling juxtaposition from where he had been to where he might be going.\u201cWhen I had that show, I had to get special permission from a counselor at the shelter to stay out beyond 6 p.m.,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere I was with people sipping wine, eating cheese and crackers, and talking about art. And an hour after the show was over, I was on the T going back to Quincy, where I had to turn in my wallet and medications, be searched and then go back into the shelter where guys were fighting and puking and passing out. It was surreal to go from one world to the next.\u201d\u201cBefore Hand After Hand,\u201d a work by Scott Benner.A few months after the show, Mr. Benner found subsidized housing on the Maine coast, and last Christmas, ArtLifting sold one of his drawings for $2,500. Like his fellow ArtLifting artists, Mr. Benner said Ms. Powers had played a significant role in turning around his fortunes. \u201cShe exudes energy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I just met her, I turned over my whole life\u2019s artwork to her because I knew I was in good hands.\u201dMs. Powers, a 27-year-old Harvard sociology graduate, founded ArtLifting with her brother Spencer in 2013 after years of searching for a creative way to mitigate the anguish of homelessness. She began working with the homeless as an 18-year-old freshman. \u201cI was flipping pancakes and making eggs at 6:30 in the morning at the shelters, but I didn\u2019t really get to know anyone,\u201d she said.When she was a sophomore, she joined LIFT, a national nonprofit organization, where she was trained to work with the homeless, helping people grapple with housing issues, unemployment, food access and self-esteem.Having been an artist, she combined her passions and urged local shelters to create art groups where their residents could come together, make art and earn one another\u2019s trust. With a public service fellowship from Harvard, she spent a year working on her concept.What Ms. Powers discovered was that many shelters already had art programs and closets filled with discarded artwork. There was no place to display the work and no obvious use for it once it was completed.But in the mix was enough quality material to get her thinking. These artisans needed only an opportunity for their work to be seen, and they might be able to sell it and make money. She organized a few art shows at Boston-area churches, with limited response. But in 2013, Boston Properties, a real estate trust, donated a space inside the city\u2019s Prudential Center shopping mall, and Ms. Powers mounted an art show for shelter artists. Shoppers stopped, admired the art, bought some of the work and asked, \u201cWhen is the next show?\u201d Something clicked for Ms. Powers, and ArtLifting was born.ArtLifting is a for-profit company that began as an online gallery for homeless and disabled artists but has quickly evolved into something more ambitious. The goal was to provide a way for these disenfranchised artists to sell their work, enhance self-esteem and change their lives. Starting with a $4,000 investment from their savings, the Powerses started ArtLifting, got noticed in the Boston media, and the fledgling venture took off.The company now has contracts with more than 70 artists, six-figure revenue, seven full-time employees and artists in eight cities. Spencer Powers departed for business school, leaving his sister in charge. Last summer, Ms. Powers raised more than $1 million from more than 20 venture capitalists and angel investors. Among them was Blake Mycoskie, the founder of TOMS, a social enterprise that began by giving away a pair of shoes to a needy person for every pair the company sold. Mr. Mycoskie started the TOMS Social Entrepreneurship Fund last fall, and ArtLifting was among its first investments.\u201cLiz\u2019s realization that talented homeless and disabled artists should have a market to sell their artwork \u2014 and that a purpose-driven business could fill this need \u2014 felt very much like the \u2018Aha\u2019 moment to start TOMS,\u201d Mr. Mycoskie said. A believer that the best ventures combine profit and purpose, Mr. Mycoskie eschewed the nonprofit route because he did not want to depend on an endless series of grants and fund-raising to sustain the business. It is a philosophy shared by Ms. Powers.Ms. Powers is eager to dispel any misconceptions about the company. ArtLifting is not a charity, and she is not a caseworker seeking artists living under overpasses. ArtLifting is an art broker, and all the artists are recommended by someone from various shelters around the country; the artists must apply to ArtLifting to represent their work. The artwork must fit the company\u2019s mission and be of high enough quality to be approved by a staff curator. The staff includes three art history majors, two of whom worked at Boston area art museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts.\u201cThe easiest way to describe a good fit is that it is salable art,\u201d Ms. Powers said. \u201cIt can be abstract, or realistic, but it must be something you can imagine in someone\u2019s home or office.\u201dArtists receive 55 percent of the profit from the sale of their work, while ArtLifting seeks individual customers and corporate sales. ArtLifting has already sold artwork to the Staples headquarters in Framingham, Mass., and the Microsoft Innovation Center in San Francisco. In addition, the company is seeking licensing deals with corporate clients to get artists\u2019 work on totebags, greeting cards, smartphone cases and other products.According to Kelly McKenna, ArtLifting\u2019s chief operating officer, the company is basing its sales projections on similar business models, such as that of Etsy, the online artisan site, which increased sales tenfold in its second year. ArtLifting is building a sales force to fuel similar growth.\u201cWe have the funding right now, but it isn\u2019t going to be here forever,\u201d said Ms. McKenna, a Harvard Business School graduate who said she turned down more lucrative job offers to join ArtLifting. \u201cThis is a critical year to grow sales, and we\u2019re hoping to close two major licensing deals and do 10 times the sales with e-commerce.\u201dThough there is potential for an artist to strike it big with a lucrative licensing deal, Ms. Powers said the more realistic outcome is providing the artists with the self-confidence and assurance that springs from being appreciated and paid for their talent. The objective is less about money than about providing hope in people\u2019s lives, she said.Kitty Zen, a 25-year old Boston artist, has been homeless since age 16, and her connection to ArtLifting has not solved her housing issue. But her experience with the company has been revelatory. Her first sale was for $1,000, with $550 for her.\u201cWhen I got that first check, it was amazing!\u201d Ms. Zen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to cash it. I wanted to frame it. The biggest absolute feeling of \u2018wow\u2019 was having my art displayed at the Museum of Fine Arts, knowing that the summer before that, I was selling my art outside on a blanket on the Boston Common.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Liz Powers joined the nonprofit organization LIFT. She joined when she was a sophomore in college, not after she graduated. It also misstated what the company ArtLifting has in eight cities. ArtLifting has artists in eight cities, not offices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThe response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets.Asked about Apple\u2019s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.The range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies\u2019 responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said.\u201cThe issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. \u201cThose companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it\u2019s not them in the spotlight.\u201dSome Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook\u2019s position on privacy.\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,\u201d Mr. Koum wrote. \u201cToday our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\u201dBut behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance.All of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201dThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201dPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.Apple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201dConor Dougherty and Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms\u2019 Online Content", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byChina is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval.The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video.The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval.China already has some of the world\u2019s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years.Legal scholars say the new rules seem aimed at restricting any type of content that might be considered a threat to the Communist Party, or social stability, with the regulations hinting at a greater effort to bring anything published by foreign entities under Chinese law.\u201cThis is the latest in a series of legal changes that seek to restrict the influence of foreign or western ideas,\u201d said Jacques deLisle, an authority on Chinese law who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also part of a larger attempt to exercise control over the Internet and new media.\u201dThe new regulations, though, do not detail exactly what types of content and which organizations would be affected. Though the new rules, for example, might seem to apply to foreign news organizations in China, existing rules already restrict global media outlets from posting content on the Internet using servers inside China. Most global news outlets, including The New York Times, are published on servers outside China, and are unlikely to be affected by the new rules.Still, legal experts say the regulations announced this week are broad enough to pose challenges to a wide range of foreign multinationals operating in China, since many of them act as distributors of online content or services.There are also questions about how such regulations would be enforced, and what types of companies would be considered distributors of online content. As a result, they could raise market-access issues for foreign companies in China ahead of trade talks with the United States.Analysts say Chinese laws are often vague and broad, which gives regulators the ability to claim greater jurisdiction. As a result, how laws are implemented is often more important than the letter of the law.One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple\u2019s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.A large number of foreign games for smartphones are released through joint ventures between Chinese companies and multinationals, and it appears the new regulations could affect those partnerships.Multinational companies have long complained that the rules in China are discriminatory. Foreign firms need licenses that can be difficult to get to operate web services in China, and there are restrictions on their ability to invest in many Chinese sectors. Several big companies, including Microsoft, have also been the subject of anti-trust investigations.The regulations stipulate that anything published online should \u201cserve the people\u201d and promote socialism and do no harm to national interests, barring, for instance, the spreading of rumors or propagating evil cults.Paul Gillis, an accounting expert who teaches at Peking University in Beijing, says a lot will also be determined by the way China executes and enforces the rules, since there is tremendous variation in the way laws are enacted and enforced in the country and to whom they apply.\u201cWhat about law firms and accounting firms \u2014 are they going to be subject to these rules?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what about companies that just have an instruction manual online, are they also going to fall under this type of rule?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe in \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byPart of the challenge is balancing individuals\u2019 privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism.Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Again Considers Selling Itself as Investor Pressure Rises", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is game on once more for a potential Yahoo deal \u2014 maybe.In acknowledging that it is exploring \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d which is Wall Street\u2019s favorite way to say \u201cputting itself up for sale,\u201d Yahoo finds itself in a familiar place. In 2008, Microsoft tried and failed to buy the web company.Three years after that effort, as activist investors like Daniel S. Loeb hovered, speculation ran wild that the company might get sold. Then competing groups of investors prepared for the chance to buy a minority stake in Yahoo \u2014 only to see that opportunity disappear.Now it is 2016, and Yahoo is reluctantly weighing a sale of its core Internet operations as hedge fund activists like Starboard Value once more criticize the company\u2019s management.It is clear that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, would prefer her own self-help plan of cutting costs, businesses and employees. Both Ms. Mayer and people close to the company have said that the current focus on a so-called reverse spin, where it would spin off into a separately traded company Yahoo\u2019s core business along with its stake in its Japanese affiliate, makes the most sense.But pressure from Starboard and others have finally forced Yahoo into weighing alternatives in the name of getting the most for long-suffering shareholders. In the company\u2019s words, it is leaving no stone unturned.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The company\u2019s announcement on Tuesday sought to make clear that it would consider \u201cqualified strategic proposals\u201d \u2014 language aimed at preserving whatever negotiating leverage it can with potential suitors. That may be difficult, given how stagnant its stock has been over the past decade.Public market investors still assign no value to Yahoo\u2019s core Internet operations. The company\u2019s stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, alone comes to about $26 billion, or virtually all of Yahoo\u2019s current market value.But clearly what remains \u2014 including Yahoo\u2019s mail, sports, finance and search operations \u2014 has some value, a point that both management and investors agitating for a sale have argued. The company says that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its core units should amount to $1 billion.Verizon Communications, often mentioned as a likely suitor for Yahoo, valued AOL, a similarly stagnant business, at roughly 7.5 times Ebitda in its $4.4 billion takeover of the onetime Internet giant last year. Analysts and investors have speculated that putting AOL and Yahoo together, a combination dreamed of for some time, could yield advertising efficiencies that could compel Verizon to pay up for Yahoo.Both corporate suitors and private equity firms have expressed interest in a potential deal, as varied as Verizon, TPG Capital or Bain Capital, according to people briefed on the matter.But it is early days yet, with several potential buyers cautioning that their plans are in the preliminary stage. The slowdown in the debt markets may put a dent in the ability of private equity firms\u2019 ability to buy Yahoo, though bankers said that the company\u2019s relatively steady revenues would support the financing required in a leveraged buyout.Yahoo may yet forgo a sale, at least if it had its way. It certainly has the experience in doing so. The trick now will be in convincing shareholders that sticking to its plans will pay off in a way that an outright sale will not \u2014 an argument that may be harder to make with irate investors prepared to wage battle once more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Microsoft\u2019s Xamarin Purchase Says About the Cloud Computing Fight", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Microsoft announced on Wednesday that it was buying Xamarin, a company that helps software developers write applications for mobile devices. The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million.It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years.A.W.S., Google and Microsoft\u2019s Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there.Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries.Developers \u201ccan choose any cloud\u201d in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added \u201cyou\u2019ll see a deep integration with Azure,\u201d including features that won\u2019t be available in competing clouds.In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others.It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity.\u201cWe see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, \u201cevery enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers.\u201dThat idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used.\u201cThe customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,\u201d said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. \u201cThey all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Drivers and Others in the Gig Economy Take a Stand", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLast September, Dallas-area drivers for UberBlack, the company\u2019s high-end car service, received an email informing them that they would be expected to start picking up passengers on UberX, its low-cost option.The next day, when the policy was scheduled to go into effect, dozens of drivers caravaned to Uber\u2019s office in downtown Dallas and planted themselves outside until company officials met with them. Many had taken out loans to buy luxury vehicles that cost upward of $35,000, and worried that the modest per-mile rate for UberX passengers would barely cover gas and wear and tear, to say nothing of their car payments.The standoff stretched across nearly three more tense days until Uber allowed them to opt out of the policy. \u201cThey thought we were just going to give up, walk away,\u201d said Kirubel Kebede, a leader of the group. \u201cBut we said, \u2018No, this is our livelihood.\u2019\u201dIn the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies. Some are beginning to band together in search of leverage and to secure what they see as fairer treatment from the platforms that make the work possible.\u201cWe started realizing we\u2019re not contractors, we\u2019re more like employees,\u201d said Berhane Alemayoh, one of the UberBlack drivers in Dallas. \u201cThey tell us what kind of car to drive. They kick you out if a customer accused you of not having a clean car. They started to tighten the rope. Gradually, we can\u2019t breathe any more.\u201dPerhaps the most prominent effort was a measure to give ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize in Seattle, which was approved by the City Council in December.But while many campaigns by alienated workers have shunned this more traditional labor-organizing approach, they have highlighted a basis for advancing the interests of gig economy workers collectively.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of workplace identity and group consciousness despite the insistence from many of these platforms that they are simply open \u2018marketplaces\u2019 or \u2018malls\u2019 for digital labor,\u201d said Mary L. Gray, a researcher at Microsoft Research and professor in the Media School at Indiana University who studies gig economy workers.The efforts extend well beyond drivers for Uber and its prime competitor, Lyft. A group of couriers who find work on the platform Postmates is waging a campaign to create an \u201cI\u2019m done after this delivery\u201d button because they worry that turning down jobs will affect how many future assignments they receive. (A Postmates official said turning down jobs had no effect on future work, but that the company was still sympathetic to the idea.)The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which organizes nannies and housekeepers, recently produced what it calls the Good Work Code, which it has urged gig economy companies to adopt.\u201cThey would be dispatched to a home that didn\u2019t feel safe, but would be hesitant to exit themselves from that situation because it might affect their ratings,\u201d said Palak Shah, the alliance official leading the effort, citing one of several issues that the Good Work Code is intended to address. A handful of firms, like Managed by Q, LeadGenius and CareLinx, have embraced the guidelines.Though the so-called Turkers tend to value the flexibility and independence of freelancing and often reject the idea of a traditional union, many have also developed a kind of working-stiff identity. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them say Jeff Bezos is their boss \u2014 we\u2019re workers here,\u201d said Niloufar Salehi, a Stanford Ph.D. student who spent a year immersed in Turker forums to help the workers organize.By contrast, sellers of goods on digital marketplaces like eBay and Etsy rarely think of themselves as employees. In their minds, they say, they are independent artisans and shopkeepers.\u201cEtsy is the place where the shop exists, where I pay rent,\u201d said Sandie Russo, a longtime seller of hand-knit accessories and knitting patterns who once ran an online forum in which sellers helped one another address common problems. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely that you\u2019re an entrepreneur, not a worker.\u201dLike the Etsy shopkeepers, many Uber drivers began their relationship with the company thinking of themselves as self-employed.Unlike sellers on eBay or Etsy, Uber drivers cannot set the prices they charge. They are also constrained by the all-important rating system \u2014 maintain an average of around 4.6 out of 5 stars from customers in many cities or risk being deactivated \u2014 to behave a certain way, like not marketing other businesses to passengers.The experience of the Dallas UberBlack drivers is telling. When Uber entered Dallas in 2012, many of the drivers were either independent hired-car operators or contractors for limousine companies who bought or leased their own cars.\u201cSome had their own business, they were fine with the business,\u201d Mr. Alemayoh said. \u201cThey just used Uber as a complement.\u201dThe drivers formed a tactical alliance with the company to help it gain the city\u2019s approval, which local cab operators resisted. Mr. Alemayoh even sang Uber\u2019s praises in testimony before the Houston City Council, after the company asked him to speak there as part of its expansion efforts. \u201cI said it\u2019s fair to drivers to have Uber,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI spoke on their behalf, they didn\u2019t pay me.\u201dBut the relationship began to sour in 2014, when the company decreed that drivers with cars made before 2008 would no longer be able to participate in UberBlack.\u201cWe said, \u2018You guys are affecting so many families,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kebede, a leader of a group called the Association of Limousine Owners and Operators of Dallas Fort Worth, formed the previous year. Uber extended the grace period by several months in some cases but did not reverse the policy.By the time Uber handed down its UberX directive in September, the drivers had long since recognized that they were at the company\u2019s beck and call. Because of Uber\u2019s popularity, almost all their other sources of business had dried up. And Uber had earned the imprimatur of the City Council, which made the drivers politically expendable, too.So it was something of a surprise that the drivers\u2019 association, which represents about 500 of the 2,000 to 3,000 black-car drivers it believes are active in the Dallas area, was able to push Uber not only to scale back the UberX change, but also to reinstate several of the drivers it had deactivated for pressuring fellow drivers as the showdown escalated.Some continue to be deactivated for what they feel are arbitrary reasons, which Uber maintains are unrelated to the protest (\u201cDrivers have the right to free expression and we respect that,\u201d said a company representative). But to the extent that the Dallas drivers have been successful, one crucial advantage is that they were able to organize in person rather than depend exclusively on the Internet and social media.That also helps explain the success of the campaign in Seattle, where Uber had previously reversed a rate cut after facing pressure from drivers. (Uber maintains that the reversal was unrelated.) \u201cThe drivers have gone out and talked to each other,\u201d said Dawn Gearhart, a spokeswoman in the area for the Teamsters union, which provides support services to local drivers. \u201cEvery time they would call a meeting, a couple hundred people would show up.\u201dIn the Tampa area, drivers have protested cuts that brought rates down to 65 cents a mile from 95 cents as of early January, and from $1.20 as recently as last spring. Net earnings for drivers there can come perilously close to subminimum wage rates on a 15- to 20-minute trip in town once they factor in pickup and wait times and the cost of gas, depreciation and maintenance.\u201cWe sometimes lower prices in a city to get more people using Uber,\u201d said an Uber representative. \u201cAs we have always said, price cuts need to work for drivers. If they do not, we will roll them back.\u201d In response, the Tampa area drivers started a weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers. During that time, they write messages on their windows about what they consider unlivable wages. The group has grown rapidly to a network of 700 drivers who communicate via an app-based walkie-talkie service called Zello.The Tampa drivers\u2019 goal is to enlist Uber\u2019s most politically valuable asset \u2014 legions of customers who have grown dependent on the service \u2014 to help send a message to Uber. Over time, they hope to extend the logouts to several hours, perhaps even a full day on the weekend.\u201cIt\u2019s a little blip on Uber\u2019s radar,\u201d said Josh Streeter, one of the leaders. \u201cBut then people might believe they have the power. That if they band together, they could pull off a bigger action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How the N.F.L. commissioner and a group of billionaire owners have kept the league on offense.Supported byThough the Shield is itself a symbol of defense, it still requires safeguarding. Goodell, the league\u2019s tightly coiled and sometimes embattled commissioner, is always going on about how his first job is to \u2018\u2018protect the Shield.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s as if he is paid another huge bonus if he mentions the Shield enough. The Shield evokes gallant warriors and immovable forces, but it is also a reminder that the enterprise is under siege. When Goodell sits at his desk, he gazes upon a large rendering of the Shield on a back wall of his office. \u2018\u2018It is a reminder to look out,\u2019\u2019 he says.These are days of both great confidence and unease in professional football. As with any empire, there is a sense that for all its riches and popularity, the league is never far from some catastrophic demise. You hear talk of the N.F.L.\u2019s \u2018\u2018existential\u2019\u2019 challenges over player health and safety; the nation\u2019s growing concern over concussions and degenerative brain disease; the drop in youth-football participation; lawsuits, regulatory roadblocks and disruptions to the broadcast model that the league\u2019s modern business has been built on.And yet, everyone wants a piece of the Shield. Put it on TV, and people will watch; put it on a jersey, they will wear it. The N.F.L.\u2019s total revenue in 2015 ($12.4 billion) is nearly double that of a decade earlier ($6.6 billion). The price of television ads during the Super Bowl has increased by more than 75 percent over the last decade. This year\u2019s conference championship games set yet another viewership record for the league: 53.3 million people watched the A.F.C. game on CBS; 45.7 million watched the N.F.C. game on Fox. Goodell talks constantly about \u2018\u2018growing the pie,\u2019\u2019 finding new revenue streams and ways to make the N.F.L. a \u2018\u2018year-round\u2019\u2019 experience rather than just during fall and winter. He has said he wants the N.F.L. to achieve $25 billion in gross revenue by 2027. No league is as relentless when it comes to growth and making cash for its billionaire cartel. It\u2019s reminiscent of a shark that will die if it doesn\u2019t keep moving and ripping little fish to shreds.For as familiar as the Shield is, the group that owns it is a closed and mysterious club. These are the proprietors of the league\u2019s teams \u2014 31 of which are owned by individuals, families or partnerships, while the other (the Green Bay Packers) is owned by shareholder fans. As a collective, the N.F.L. owners are known within the league as the Membership.The sport might represent the great spectacle of 21st-century America, played by extraordinary, bulked-up specimens before millions of viewers. But it\u2019s these needy billionaires who own it. They are the heads of the football city-states that stir our civic passions and twist our moods from September to February. They are cutthroat businessmen and competitors, but they also envision themselves as noble stewards of the community.\u2018\u2018We offer a respite,\u2019\u2019 Jerry Jones, the rascally owner of the Dallas Cowboys, told me. \u2018\u2018We are a respite that moves you away from your trials and missteps, or my trials and missteps.\u2019\u2019 Jones describes a weekly display in which representatives from my town and your town meet up. \u2018\u2018And we\u2019ll just have a big old time, being relevant to one another.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Relevant\u2019\u2019 is a curiously timid concept in light of the N.F.L.\u2019s dominance. But it, too, is heard with regularity in N.F.L. circles. Of course the league is relevant to contemporary America \u2014 as the Beatles are relevant to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I thought of the news conference Bill Clinton gave in 1995 at a particularly low moment of his presidency. \u2018\u2018I am relevant,\u2019\u2019 the most powerful man in the free world felt the need to say. \u2018\u2018The Constitution gives me relevance.\u2019\u2019For its current state of unmatched relevance, the Membership praises Roger Goodell, even if a good part of the football-watching and football-playing public does not. Since Goodell became the league commissioner in 2006, most of the Membership has seen the value of its franchises double (20 are now among the 50 most valuable sports franchises on the planet, according to Forbes).Goodell understands leverage. \u2018\u2018Whenever you have immense power like that, you\u2019ve got the whip hand,\u2019\u2019 said Senator John McCain, who this season criticized the N.F.L. for charging the Department of Defense for promotional events for the military at league games. Goodell thinks little of success, more of the alternative. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m driven,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t like failure. Everything can change so fast in our society, for me or anyone else.\u2019\u2019Another mantra I heard repeated around the N.F.L. headquarters is \u2018\u2018Only the paranoid survive.\u2019\u2019 The phrase \u2014 popularized by Andrew Grove of Intel \u2014 is a Goodell favorite. During my three visits to the N.F.L.\u2019s Park Avenue offices, I was always struck by the thick propaganda of the place. The N.F.L. Network plays at all times on big screens. Every corporate office celebrates itself, to some degree, but the N.F.L.\u2019s is particularly overwhelming, as if it were the sanctum of a highly successful megachurch marrying ESPN and Scientology. I had the strange feeling, as I waited in the lobby, that I was being watched, if not filmed.On my first visit, Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.\u2019s longtime communications director, took me to the cafeteria, known as the Huddle. We passed photo murals celebrating the various Members in their moments of triumph. He brought me an iced tea, sat me down and told me good stuff about the commissioner, good things about the league, big and heady numbers. He handed me positive fact sheets and articles and then, unprompted, summed things up: \u2018\u2018Roger wins.\u2019\u2019On another visit to the Huddle, I met Tod Leiweke, the league\u2019s chief operating officer, who was hired last summer. Leiweke, a former Seattle Seahawks president, has brushed-back white hair, a sunny and almost New Agey manner and a beakish nose that makes him somewhat resemble an actual sea hawk. He wore a beige sweater with the Shield embroidered across his chest. Leiweke got to know Goodell on a climb up Mount Rainier with other executives. Over lunch, he hurled mountain metaphors at me. \u2018\u2018There are \u00adchallenges to running the most successful league in the world,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like clouds on Rainier. Not everything\u2019s perfect, but you fight through it.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018The league is trying to climb new mountains of its own.\u2019\u2019He described Goodell as \u2018\u2018convicted,\u2019\u2019 meaning, it seemed, having strong convictions. \u2018\u2018Roger is hard-working, dedicated, convicted, tenacious,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He is an amazing, convicted guy.\u2019\u2019 He closed on message. \u2018\u2018And he\u2019s a winner.\u2019\u2019Pats fans have company in their distaste for the commissioner. Goodell has come under blistering public criticism, periodic calls for his resignation and a procession of rebukes in court over a host of incidents and scandals \u2014 each knowable in shorthand (Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson, the various \u2018\u2018-gates\u2019\u2019). He is booed every year at the N.F.L. draft. There are sports bars with dartboards featuring his likeness. Goodell\u2019s high profile is itself a testament to football\u2019s runaway prosperity and popularity. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like the old saying,\u2019\u2019 the Houston Texans\u2019 owner, Robert C. McNair, told me. \u2018\u2018The higher up the palm tree the monkey climbs, the more of his ass is exposed.\u2019\u2019 McNair laughed. He supports Goodell, although he thinks his astronomical salary makes him a target of easy resentment ($44 million in 2012 and $35 million in 2013 in salary and bonuses, the last years those numbers were available).Every chief-executive job involves political duties, but watching Goodell, who is 56, evokes a most familiar mastery. I live in Washington and usually write about politics; Goodell \u2014 whose father, Charles Goodell, was a senator from New York \u2014 seems very much of that world. On camera, Goodell can come off as tight, smug and sanctimonious \u2014 a politician, and not a particularly compelling one. Since the Ray Rice domestic-violence scandal of 2014, he rarely speaks to the news media in unsafe settings. He repeats himself often and recites talking points. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d like to see him more relaxed and smiling and answering the questions,\u2019\u2019 McNair said. \u2018\u2018You know, he\u2019s got all these legal advisers telling him you can\u2019t say this or you can\u2019t say that.\u2019\u2019But as he worked the stadium from midfield before the N.F.C. championship game, Goodell\u2019s schmoozing genes were elite. He moved among his constituents in a former jock\u2019s ballet of bro-hugs and two-handed handgrips, punctuated with backslaps. He received guests, laughing easily if not for real. Goodell made sure to seek out Panthers executives, the Cardinals\u2019 owner, referees and each head coach.\u2018\u2018Come on, let\u2019s walk,\u2019\u2019 Goodell told me. \u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get away from the crowd, we\u2019ll never get this done.\u2019\u2019 Goodell said he spends many N.F.L. Sundays watching games at home in Bronxville, north of New York City. He boasted about his man cave equipped with three TVs, which he watches simultaneously while checking multiple laptops. He watches as a fan, as the commissioner and as a micromanager, firing off emails, making calls to his staff about everything from a referee\u2019s call to something an announcer said to a promotion he caught that should not have aired. Goodell told me he spends most weekends watching game after game of football \u2014 pro, college and even high school. I asked him if he had seen \u2018\u2018Concussion,\u2019\u2019 the Will Smith film about the devastating toll of head injuries in N.F.L. players and the league\u2019s complicity in either ignoring or covering up the problem. Goodell said he would get around to it. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t tell you the last time I\u2019ve been to a movie,\u2019\u2019 he told me, although in the next breath he said he had seen \u2018\u2018The Intern,\u2019\u2019 starring Robert DeNiro, with his twin teenage daughters during the snowstorm the night before. Goodell then shoveled out his driveway so he and his wife could go to Soul Cycle on Sunday morning before he flew down to Charlotte via N.F.L. corporate jet. He likes people to know that he\u2019s a workout fiend. He gets up at 5:30, does his weights and cardio and gets \u2018\u2018jazzed up\u2019\u2019 to start his day. He has no visible belly but always seems to be flexing his torso under tight blue suits. Goodell also likes it known that he used to play football in high school, and he appears to be especially energetic around N.F.L. players in their workplace.More and more, the commissioner\u2019s job is to serve as a protective buffer for the Membership. He talks about head injuries so that the owner of, say, the Buffalo Bills does not have to. No one called for the resignation of the Ravens\u2019 owner, Steve Bisciotti, after the video of Ray Rice knocking out his girlfriend in an Atlantic City elevator went public. Goodell testified before Congress on concussions in 2009 and listened to Representative Linda T. S\u00e1nchez of California compare the N.F.L. to the tobacco industry for its indifference to the physical harm being done to its players. \u2018\u2018He is smooth, very smooth,\u201d Jerry Jones said of Goodell. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d say he\u2019s very classy. You see that kind of discipline and refinement.\u2019\u2019Goodell was the middle of five boys born in seven years to Jean and Charles Goodell. His father was a moderate Republican congressman who was appointed to succeed Senator Robert F. Kennedy after Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1968. Charles Goodell was a favorite of President Richard M. Nixon until he turned against the Vietnam War and introduced a bill to end it. The White House then turned against Goodell and worked to defeat him in the 1970 election. Roger, only a boy, followed his father everywhere on the campaign trail. From this, the commissioner learned the value of making tough and principled decisions, he says. He keeps a copy of his father\u2019s Vietnam Disengagement Act on the wall of his office.Goodell is married to Jane Skinner, a former Fox News anchor and the daughter of Samuel Skinner, a former transportation secretary and White House chief of staff under George Bush. As troubles have swirled around the league, Goodell has relied heavily on the counsel of Glover Park Group, the Washington lobbying, crisis and public-affairs giant. Joe Lockhart, a Glover Park \u00adfounder and the White House press secretary for the Monica Lewinsky-era Bill Clinton, was recently named the N.F.L.\u2019s executive vice president of communications; Cynthia Hogan, former counsel to Vice President Joe Biden, was hired after the Ray Rice affair to run the league\u2019s strengthened public policy and government affairs arm.One key to being a good politician is an ability to identify and prioritize constituencies. Goodell keeps a call sheet at his desk with the names of all the team owners. Their ranks are mostly male and mostly white, with a few exceptions, including Martha Firestone Ford, the 90-year-old widow of the Detroit Lions\u2019 longtime owner, William Clay Ford, and Shahid Khan, the Pakistani-born businessman who owns the Jacksonville Jaguars.Goodell checks in with the Members at least once a month. He is solicitous and attentive and learns what issues are important to them \u2014 precisely what a good legislative leader would do with his caucus. By contrast, Goodell\u2019s predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, had a more distant and even contemptuous relationship with the Membership. He would deal with seven or eight prominent owners and mostly leave the rest to his staff. One player agent described Tagliabue, a cerebral lawyer, as a parental and elusive figure whom the Membership grew tired of, and vice versa. Tagliabue was the longtime outside counsel to the league, while Goodell spent his entire career in the league office. With Goodell, the Membership hired someone more like a younger brother.Goodell serves at the Membership\u2019s pleasure and carries out their wishes, except when he is fining them, taking their draft picks away and damaging their reputations. \u2018\u2018How many jobs do you have where you actually can end up disciplining your boss?\u2019\u2019 Goodell wondered. But Goodell, who started working at the league after graduating from Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, never wanted to work anywhere else. \u2018\u2018If there is one thing I want to accomplish in my life besides becoming commissioner of the N.F.L.,\u2019\u2019 he wrote to his father in a letter while in high school, \u2018\u2018it is to make you proud of me.\u2019\u2019Jones might be one of the more castigated owners in sports, in large part over his continued insistence after 27 years on being exhaustively involved in the team\u2019s football operations (he holds the title of general manager, a rare designation among owners). The once-dynastic Cowboys have not been to a Super Bowl in two decades. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s numbing, it\u2019s numbing, what\u2019s happened to us,\u2019\u2019 Jones said as his team\u2019s record sat at 3-8.He is, in some ways, the embodiment of today\u2019s N.F.L.: rich, bold, distracted, insecure and more than a little tone-deaf. He can also be irresistibly fun, with a big taste for Scotch, a gleam in his icy aqua eyes and a penchant for stem-winding parables that he will often stumble over but that will still make a strange kind of sense.When I asked him why the N.F.L. could hum along so profitably despite the perennial crises it faces, Jones launched into something he once heard from a friend who owned a chain of Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants. He asked this friend how he could keep the tastes and flavors of the food consistent from franchise to franchise. The answer: intensity. \u2018\u2018If something is supposed to be cold, make it as cold as hot ice,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u2018\u2018If it\u2019s supposed to be hot, have it burn the roof of their mouth. Intensity covers up a lot of frailty in the taste and preparation.\u2019\u2019 Likewise, the intensity and drama of football can obscure the dangers, decadence and moral ambiguities inherent to the beloved blood sport.Owners like Jones tend to think of themselves as the geniuses behind the league. They are the ones who build the stadiums, lead the committees, spend their own money and then see their egos tossed up and down on a scoreboard every week. \u2018\u2018Each team is a sovereign nation unto itself,\u2019\u2019 said Nate Jackson, who played six years in the N.F.L. with the Denver Broncos and later wrote a memoir, \u2018\u2018Slow Getting Up.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018They have their own general and their own infantry. They have young men fighting old men\u2019s battles.\u2019\u2019The owners\u2019 ranks are composed of a mix of new money and legacy owners from old-line N.F.L. families. Rivalries and petty grudges can play out in meetings, but the real face-offs happen by proxy. I talked by phone to Mark Wilf, a co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings, a few days after the Vikings were defeated by the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs when the Vikings\u2019 kicker, Blair Walsh, missed a 27-yard field goal in the final seconds (and later openly sobbed at his locker). Wilf grew up a Giants fan in New Jersey and used to take losses hard, he said. He remembered his father telling him: \u2018\u2018It could be worse. You could be the owner.\u2019\u2019I had watched the final seconds of the Vikings-Seahawks game on a TV in the concourse of Fed-Ex Field in suburban Maryland, where the Washington Redskins were hosting the Packers. I have always been fascinated by Daniel M. Snyder, the Redskins\u2019 owner, whose unpopularity represents an extremely rare point of agreement among Democrats and Republicans in the capital. He has been pilloried on a variety of issues, from running off accomplished coaches and meddling in football decisions (the Redskins have made the playoffs only five times since he bought the team in 1999) to refusing to change the team name, which offends many.I met Snyder for the first time a few days later in Houston, where he had joined his fellow Members in a special session to resolve which team, or teams, would move to Los Angeles. Snyder, who made his fortune in marketing, is known for aggressive revenue initiatives (at one point charging fans to watch training camp). These tactics might be unpopular to customers, but they have made the Redskins one of the league\u2019s most valuable franchises. Snyder was joined by Tony Wyllie, the Redskins\u2019 public-relations representative, whose sole reason for flying all the way to Houston on Snyder\u2019s jet seemed to be to babysit for my 10-minute meeting. Wyllie suggested strongly to me beforehand that Snyder does not like discussing \u2018\u2018the name issue.\u2019\u2019I found Snyder jittery and vulnerable and eager to present himself well. He said he supported Goodell (\u2018\u2018the Shield comes first\u2019\u2019). He struggled keeping eye contact. But what struck me most was the devastation that came over Snyder when he brought up his team\u2019s loss to the Packers a few days earlier \u2014 which he did six separate times. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t even talk about it,\u2019\u2019 Snyder said, shaking his head, and then talking about it. \u2018\u2018I thought we were going to win that game, man.\u2019\u2019 He marveled over how great Aaron Rodgers, the Packers\u2019 quarterback, was. \u2018\u2018God almighty, this is just terrible,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018This really, really hurts.\u2019\u2019 He said he grows jealous of other owners whose teams are still playing. I asked him how long it would take him to recover. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll probably start to feel better after the Super Bowl,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018When all the teams are unbeaten again.\u2019\u2019Certain members of the Membership are more influential than others to Goodell, though he will never admit this. Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder and the owner of the Seahawks, is almost never seen or heard from by the league. Neither is the Lions\u2019 matriarch, Martha Firestone Ford, although she did browbeat Goodell at a meeting over terrible officiating. Goodell speaks most days to the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 chairman, Daniel M. Rooney, the commissioner told me. Rooney, 83, is a former ambassador to Ireland and an N.F.L. elder statesman who knocked on the door of Goodell\u2019s hotel room in 2006 to tell him that he had been elected commissioner.There is a core of men you always hear described as \u2018\u2018key owners.\u2019\u2019 They include heirs to old-line N.F.L. families \u2014 Art Rooney II of Pittsburgh (Daniel\u2019s son), John K. Mara of the New York Giants and Clark Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs. Then there are (relatively) newer, more classically entrepreneurial owners \u2014 Robert McNair in Houston, Jerry Richardson in Carolina, Jerry Jones in Dallas and Robert K. Kraft in New England.It also says something about the generational and demographic makeup of the Membership that these influential \u2018\u2018newer\u2019\u2019 owners are all white men in their 70s. They skew Republican. Mitt Romney was ridiculed in 2012 for asserting his love of football by boasting that some of his good friends owned N.F.L. teams; the Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson, is the national finance chairman for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign; McNair, the Texans\u2019 owner and a big Republican donor, gave $10,000 last year to help repeal a ballot initiative in Houston that protected gays and lesbians from forms of discrimination.McNair, 78, has a bald oval head and bears a slight resemblance to Mr. Clean. He speaks in a blunt drawl. I asked him what he thought of having his team featured last summer on the HBO reality show \u2018\u2018Hard Knocks,\u2019\u2019 about life at an N.F.L. training camp. He said it was a net plus, although he was distraught over how much swearing there was and joked that Coach Bill O\u2019Brien should introduce a cuss jar. I asked McNair if he was as sensitive to other offensive language, specifically the N.F.L. team in the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s being named the Redskins. McNair told me that he grew up in western North Carolina, around many Cherokee Indians. \u2018\u2018Everybody respected their courage,\u2019\u2019 McNair told me of the Indians. \u2018\u2018They might not have respected the way they held their whiskey, but. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2019\u2019 He laughed. \u2018\u2018We respected their courage. They\u2019re very brave people.\u2019\u2019 Put McNair down as not offended by \u2018\u2018Redskins.\u2019\u2019Outside, the citizens of various kingdoms massed. I befriended a group of Oakland Raiders fans who had gathered on the sidewalk in front of the Westin Memorial City Hotel. They had traveled here from as far away as Northern California to display a giant black-and-silver flag and show support for their team\u2019s staying in Oakland despite the efforts of the team owner, Mark Davis, to move the team to Los Angeles. They were joined, in smaller numbers, by fans of the San Diego Chargers and the St. Louis Rams, who were also at risk of seeing their teams bolt.\u2018\u2018The Raiders are bigger than football,\u2019\u2019 a college student named Ray Perez said. Perez, who calls himself Dr. Death, wore a frizzy black wig and striped black-and-white jail pants. He relayed to me an important lesson that his Raider Nation mentor, Raider Jerry, had once imparted. Being a part of this brotherhood involves much more than being a sports fan. It is a form of giving back. Raider Nation is not a club, it\u2019s a movement. \u2018\u2018And it is a people-driven movement,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Death added. \u2018\u2018We show the power of people coming together for something that we love and believe in.\u2019\u2019Their power was limited here. The Membership ground through their day of private votes and deliberations in a meeting room upstairs. They were debating the merits of a proposed stadium project south of Los Angeles in Carson, Calif., that would become the home of the Chargers and possibly the Raiders, as well as a more ambitious extravaganza in Inglewood, on a 60-acre tract near Hollywood Park, that had been imagined by the Rams\u2019 owner, Stan Kroenke.Late in the day, Jerry Jones announced to the commissioner that if discussions went on much longer, he would have no choice but to escape to the hotel bar with the Lions\u2019 Martha Firestone Ford (beer and wine were brought into the meeting room). Paul Allen, who never attends league meetings, showed up for the first time in five years and, according to one owner afterward, \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t shut up.\u2019\u2019By nightfall, the tired tycoons began moving through the lobby en route to waiting limos that would ferry them to private jets and the hell out of Houston. Word emerged that the Membership had voted by secret ballot \u2014 30-to-2 \u2014 in support of the Rams\u2019 multibillion-dollar project in Inglewood. After the vote, Kroenke, a clunky-mannered real estate magnate with a charm quotient to rival the Rams\u2019 meager win totals of recent years, joined Goodell for a news conference. He has a pale and jowly countenance, an unruly comb-over and a \u201970s-vintage mustache. He is known as \u2018\u2018Silent Stan,\u2019\u2019 and the news conference was about as much as he had spoken publicly in years. \u2018\u2018We spend a lot of resources trying to make sure that we stay relevant,\u2019\u2019 he said in a monotone-mumble. Ray Ratto, a Bay Area sportswriter, observed via Twitter that Kroenke looked as if he were \u2018\u2018overdue for his next baby wombat blood injection.\u2019\u2019I parked myself in the lobby and watched the owners escape. \u2018\u2018Hey, y\u2019all,\u2019\u2019 said Tom Benson, the New Orleans Saints\u2019 88-year-old owner, while rolling his wheelchair by. Jones held forth nursing a tumbler of Scotch. The Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson, strolled past him unbothered, wearing a suit and a Jansport backpack over both shoulders. \u2018\u2018Everybody wins in this deal,\u2019\u2019 the Miami Dolphins\u2019 owner, Stephen M. Ross, declared to a bank of reporters as he trailed Johnson out the door. \u2018\u2018What about the fans of St. Louis?\u2019\u2019 someone in the gallery cracked. Ross shrugged. \u2018\u2018Well, somebody has to lose,\u2019\u2019 he said.Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who represents the abandoned fans of St. Louis, worked closely on the Rams\u2019 relocation process. What is rankling about the league, she said afterward, is its insistence that it is driven by factors beyond the bottom line. \u2018\u2018The money involved in the L.A. plan was irresistible for a league that is focused on growing it to a $25 billion enterprise,\u2019\u2019 McCaskill told me. She described Goodell as \u2018\u2018careful.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018He is always trying to measure the most important constituency, which are the 32 owners, against all the other pressures,\u2019\u2019 she said.The loser among the Membership was Mark Davis, the Everyman spawn of the Raiders\u2019 outlaw founder, Al Davis. His father, who died in 2011, was at constant war with the league. He still engenders bad will among certain owners in a way that does no favors for his son. (\u2018\u2018Oakland gets nothing,\u2019\u2019 Robert McNair told me. \u2018\u2018Al used to sue us all the time.\u2019\u2019) Mark Davis sports a blond version of the Jim Carrey bowl cut from \u2018\u2018Dumb and Dumber.\u2019\u2019 (I could also see Captain Kangaroo.) He wears a fanny pack, drives a 1997 Dodge Caravan, used to frequent Hooters for its all-you-can-eat-wings specials and looks every bit the misfit cousin who keeps showing up at the Membership\u2019s Thanksgiving table. It could not have been easy being Al Davis\u2019s son. As a practical matter, Mark Davis\u2019s family baggage also includes a most unfortunate pre-existing condition \u2014 the worst \u2018\u2018facility\u2019\u2019 in the league, Oakland\u2019s O.co Coliseum, which he shares with the Athletics baseball team.I found Mark Davis leaning against a couch and talking to a group of Raiders fans in the bar of the Westin late that night. He had changed into a powder \u00adblue sweatshirt and black-and-white sneakers and wore a relaxed air of resignation. I asked whether he was mad at Goodell. \u2018\u2018Nah, I call Roger the pope,\u2019\u2019 Davis told me. I wondered why. \u2018\u2018I like to bust his chops.\u2019\u2019 He is fully aware of his runt-of-the-litter standing within the Membership. \u2018\u2018Everyone thinks I have no money,\u201d Davis said. \u2018\u2018But I\u2019ve got $500 million and a team.\u2019\u2019Two weeks earlier, Joe Thomas, a star offensive tackle for the Cleveland Browns, compared Goodell to the professional-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon in an ESPN interview. Thomas did this while voicing support for Brady, saying that the punishment for whatever the quarterback might have done with his footballs was akin to getting the death penalty for a minor traffic violation. Thomas also called the commissioner\u2019s tactics \u2018\u2018brilliant.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018He\u2019s made the N.F.L. relevant 365 [days a year] by having these outrageous, ridiculous witch hunts,\u2019\u2019 Thomas said of Goodell. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s made the game more popular than ever, and it\u2019s become so much more of an entertainment business, and it\u2019s making so much money.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s almost like the Kim Kardashian factor \u2014 that any news is good news when you\u2019re in the N.F.L.\u2019\u2019 The Membership knows the power of a well-placed villain in the name of relevance. \u2018\u2018Make no mistake about it: Legitimate negative criticism does not diminish interest,\u2019\u2019 Jones told me. \u2018\u2018I know we have a huge element of fans that dislike the Cowboys,\u2019\u2019 he added with some pride.I asked Goodell what it was like to be hated. Not just unpopular, but really hated, the way sports fans hate these days, with threats and vulgar tweets and increased police vigilance at his vacation home in Maine during the summer of Deflategate. He said it is part of the job. \u2018\u2018You get knocked down, and you get up,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said. \u2018\u2018Nobody cheers for the commissioner,\u2019\u2019 he added, quoting something the former commissioner Pete Rozelle used to tell him.But Rozelle ran a much different N.F.L. and, maybe more to the point, at a very different time. The N.F.L. did not aspire to year-round relevance; the early N.F.L. drafts were a few dozen people in a hotel ballroom, as opposed to the three-day, nationally televised arena pageant they have now become. Limits were not pushed as far. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like this thing I say around the office, \u2018Believe in better,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Goodell told me. \u2018\u2018Everything can get better. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s ratings or attendance or anything. We can make it better if we really work at it.\u2019\u2019A few days before the conference championship games, Antwaan Randle El, a former wide receiver for the Steelers and the Redskins, said in an interview that he wished he had played baseball instead of football. At only 36, Randle El said he has bouts of memory loss. Goodell spun this news as a triumph of elevated awareness and more open discourse. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s part of the conversation,\u2019\u2019 he told me, meaning that players and former players feel free to \u2018\u2018come forward\u2019\u2019 to discuss medical issues. Rather than ever admitting the obvious \u2014 that the N.F.L. was late to recognize the frequency and dangers of concussions \u2014 he is fond of pointing out the number of \u2018\u2018safety-related rule changes\u2019\u2019 the league has made during his tenure: 39, to be precise. And yet the number of concussions throughout the league is actually up this season.Nate Jackson told me that for all Goodell\u2019s evangelism about making the game safer, back in the locker room, it\u2019s the same conversation as always. \u2018\u2018Hit them as hard as you [expletive] can.\u2019\u2019 He called Goodell \u2018\u2018a football politician, which is his perfect job\u2019\u2019 \u2014 someone who has brilliantly nurtured a system that grows the pie, expands to Europe and possibly Latin America and gains eyeballs trained on the ever-present Shield. The Shield is financial and cultural gold, proof that the system is working \u2014 at least for the Membership.\u2018\u2018To me, the Shield was my loss of identity within a system,\u2019\u2019 Jackson said. \u2018\u2018It was the suggestion that it was not about me. I was prepared to die to make a play. But the reason football is so dangerous is that the men making the decisions are not the ones getting hit.\u2019\u2019As the kickoff of the N.F.C. championship game approached, Bank of America Stadium kept getting louder, until it got quiet. \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the flag? I can\u2019t find the flag,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said, scanning the field while preparing to observe \u2018\u2018The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019\u2019 But instead of the song, it was a prayer that would precede the anthem and the rumble, and the commissioner closed his eyes and lowered his head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Privacy Fight Tests Relationship With White House", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was relentless during a private meeting of tech giants and President Obama\u2019s top national security officials last month. Encrypted devices like the iPhone are here to stay, he insisted. Law enforcement needs to find a way to do its job in a new world.James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch pushed back, but Mr. Cook stood firm, several participants said.\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Mr. Cook told those around the table, including Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and the heads of the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cI think there has been a lack of leadership in the White House on this.\u201dDenis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, took exception and said so. Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.Either way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.Although the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.By refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.If Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.It is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.The exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.Four months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201dThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data. But if a disagreement happens, \u201cit\u2019s not bad for this policy conversation to happen transparently in a court proceeding.\u201dAt the same time, there was a growing alliance between this White House and Silicon Valley. Although other presidents have looked to the valley\u2019s innovators and venture capitalists for money, political support and ideas, this administration has wooed tech executives in far greater numbers. The president also has close ties to those in the industry who supported him early on, including Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn.Now, while Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are expected to file papers to the court in solidarity with Apple\u2019s encryption position, Mr. Cook stands relatively alone in his fight. This was evident at the meeting in January in Silicon Valley.As participants recalled it, Mr. Cook was the one who shifted the conversation to encryption \u2014 prompting nods of agreement from executives at Dropbox, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and others.Soon after, Mr. McDonough brought the meeting to an end. \u201cPut a pin in it,\u201d participants recalled that he said, making it clear that the conversation would continue.But one month later, the Justice Department moved against Apple.The White House Memo article on Saturday about a contentious standoff that pits President Obama against Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, over government efforts to force Apple to hack into a dead terrorist\u2019s iPhone misstated the nature of the Justice Department\u2019s move against Apple. Although it took legal action against the company, it did not sue.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, began his speech on Friday at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he got a standing ovation.As Mr. Cook, 55, stood before the auditorium on Apple\u2019s campus, the audience \u2014 made up mostly of investors in the company \u2014 rose from their seats and applauded him.\u201cWhere we stand in times of controversy is a measure of our character,\u201d said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, an Apple shareholder who attended the meeting. \u201cSome leaders only follow opinion polls. Others stand up for their principles, refuse to compromise, and mold opinion. We have such a leader of Apple, Tim Cook.\u201dApple is \u201ca staunch advocate for our customers\u2019 privacy and personal safety,\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWe do these things because they are the right things to do. Being hard doesn\u2019t scare us.\u201dTechnology\u2019s largest companies are now also aligning themselves with Apple. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have said they will file one or more briefs in California federal court next week in support of Apple. More could join.Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was also at the meeting, said she applauded Apple\u2019s leadership in fighting for the security and privacy of customers. She said the foundation would file a brief supporting Apple\u2019s refusal to comply with the court order.During the shareholder meeting, an energized Mr. Cook, dressed in his customary blue oxford shirt and jeans, also noted that Apple had released new versions of its mobile and desktop operating systems, which have the advanced security and encryption features that have frustrated the law enforcement agents who want access to data on Apple\u2019s devices. He said 77 percent of all active devices were using these most advanced and secure operating systems.Other social issues were also raised at the meeting. Mr. Cook said a pay study at the company had found that women earned 99.6 cents for every $1 that men did and that underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents for every $1 that white employees earned in similar roles. Mr. Cook said the company was taking measures to erase the discrepancy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Watch the Super Bowl When You Don\u2019t Have Cable", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixThis year\u2019s Super Bowl, the 50th, will be the second that CBS has streamed free, though it will be the first time its streaming apps play the commercials while they are shown on television, Mr. Gerttula added.That the Super Bowl is so easily streamable should only accelerate the consumer revolt against big cable. The research firm eMarketer estimated that last year about five million American households that once paid for TV no longer did, up about 10.9 percent from the previous year. The firm estimated that by 2018, one in five American households will not subscribe to cable or satellite TV.Fret not, brave cord-cutter. I tested several other options, including digital antennas and the Slingbox, a device that can connect to a friend or family member\u2019s cable box to watch the game on a streaming device. The antennas were simple to set up, and the picture quality was excellent. The Slingbox was a bit rougher to set up and will not be an ideal method for watching the Super Bowl, but is a useful device to keep in your back pocket if you are often abroad and don\u2019t want to miss out on live national sports.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.After some experimentation, I found that sticking the antenna to a wall around the corner from my television pulled the clearest signal from CBS. I got about 40 channels, including ABC, various home shopping channels and a station that plays only Korean pop music videos.Consumers will have to do their homework before buying an antenna by looking up their proximity to nearby transmitters. Antennas Direct says that with an outdoor antenna like the 2V, you\u2019ll probably get poor reception if you\u2019re more than 70 miles from transmitters. For indoors antennas like the Eclipse, 35 miles is outside the comfort zone.If you are reasonably close to TV transmitters, the benefits of an antenna make the technology a sound investment. It\u2019s cheap, for one, and when you get a clear signal, the high-definition channels can look even better than digital cable because the image you get with an antenna is raw video broadcast over the air, unlike the compressed video sent over digital cable.\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting the raw video, it might be double or triple the quality of satellite or cable,\u201d said Richard Schneider, the founder of Antennas Direct, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more detailed picture than what you\u2019d get through paid TV.\u201dAntennas and free online streaming of the Super Bowl aren\u2019t viable options for international fans, but the Slingbox is one workaround. If you have friends or family members with a cable subscription, you can hook a Slingbox up to the back of their cable box.The Slingbox pulls in whatever is playing on the cable box, and you can watch the video live on a web browser or on a device that supports the Slingplayer app, like Apple and Android mobile devices, Roku boxes, Chromecast or Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. The Slingplayer apps also have a remote control, allowing you to change the channel on the cable box.I plugged a Slingbox M2 ($200) into a cable box and had a rough time getting the remote control to work inside the Slingplayer app. Still, as long as the cable box is set to CBS, the Slingbox is an easy method for tuning in to the game from abroad.\u201cSlingbox works anywhere in the world,\u201d said Mark Vena, a Sling Media executive. \u201cYou have a right to use it wherever you are\u201d as long as you or your family members are already paying for cable, he added.Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @bxchen Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Will Further Block Some European Search Results", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byIn its continuing game of hide-and-seek with European privacy regulators, Google is about to make more changes to how people view its search results in Europe.The companyt will soon block access to certain disputed links from all of its domains \u2014 including the main United States one, Google.com \u2014 when people in Europe use its online search engine, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The move is the latest attempt by Google to comply with a May 2014 data privacy ruling by Europe\u2019s highest court, while also trying to minimize damage to the company\u2019s vast global database of digital information. That ruling, known as the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and hailed by many national data privacy officials in Europe, forced Google to comply with the region\u2019s tough privacy rules, even when those laws were at odds with the company\u2019s goal of providing unfettered information to people worldwide.\u201cThere\u2019s a cultural gap between Europe and the United States,\u201d said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of Linklaters, a law firm. \u201cIn Europe, we have a very strong position that views privacy as a fundamental right.\u201dUntil now, Google has complied with the European court\u2019s decision to remove links to online material at the request of European residents, though it has balked at extending those privacy rights to its global domains like Google.com that would encompass its non-European users.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Now, Google will go further, in part to forestall legal disputes and potential fines from European national privacy agencies. The search giant has told Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities that it will start blocking certain links on all of its global domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 when they are viewed from the European Union country where the original claim was made.As part of the change, which will take effect by March, when someone succeeds in asking Google to remove or block access to a link for legitimate privacy reasons, the company will remove the link from its European domains \u2014 like Google.es in Spain, for example \u2014 and block access to the link from all of its global sites that can be used from the country where the request was submitted.In practice, that would mean a successful request from someone in Spain would lead to the removal of the link from all of Google\u2019s European online search domains, while blocking access to it from all of its non-European domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 from that specific country.Search results for individuals outside the European Union, including the United States, will not be affected, and links on Google\u2019s non-European domains will still be accessible from other European countries, according to the people with knowledge of h Google\u2019s plans.The company has continually stressed that the European court ruling should apply only within the 28-member bloc. Google argues that if it agreed to alter all of its global search requests on behalf of the Europeans, other countries like China and Russia may soon demand that Google change its practices to meet their own national laws.Google has fallen afoul of Europe\u2019s privacy rules before, particularly in privacy-sensitive Germany. But several other United States tech companies have also found themselves embroiled in complicated legal disputes over how they collect, monitor and use the data from the likes of people\u2019s social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases, which are fast becoming digital currency for companies\u2019 lucrative advertising operations.Yet it is Google that has often become the target of Europe\u2019s privacy concerns. That is partly because the company\u2019s activities stretch across people\u2019s daily digital activities through Google\u2019s dominant search engine, its ever-present mobile phone software known as Android and the company\u2019s other online services.Despite Google\u2019s renewed efforts to appease European privacy concerns, it remains unclear whether the company\u2019s actions will be enough to head off the continuing legal challenges by Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities.Elsa Trochet-Mac\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the French privacy authority that has already fined Google for previous privacy infractions, said on Thursday that the company informed Europe\u2019s data protection regulators last month about the coming changes to its search results, but that the French agency had not yet decided whether they meant that Google now complied with Europe\u2019s privacy rules.\u201cWe\u2019re now analyzing the new changes,\u201d Ms. Trochet-Mac\u00e9 said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Jobless Rate Is 42 Percent? Donald Trump Has a Point, Sort Of", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump seems quite certain that the real unemployment rate is higher than the 4.9 percent that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported it to be. A lot higher.\u201cDon\u2019t believe these phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night. \u201cThe number\u2019s probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\u201dMr. Trump might be bombastic, but he\u2019s not entirely wrong. And the ways in which he is wrong are actually useful for anyone who wants to understand how to make sense of economic data.The truth is, there is no \u201ctrue\u201d unemployment rate. There are a nearly infinite multitude of ways to think about, and calculate, joblessness. The unemployment rate that is widely reported in the press on the first Friday of every month isn\u2019t some manna from heaven, but rather a convention that has developed over the years that gives a partial \u2014 but still useful \u2014 view of the state of the labor market.The B.L.S. itself reports six different unemployment rates, of which the one the press most commonly cites is called U-3, the third of the six options. But anyone with Microsoft Excel and access to B.L.S. and census data could dream up their own version.So what\u2019s in that 4.9 percent \u201cofficial\u201d unemployment rate? The numerator is Americans who are unemployed, the people who told a survey taker that they do not have a job but want one and have actively sought a job in the last four weeks. There were 7.8 million people in that category in January. The denominator is the total labor force, meaning people who either have a job or are looking for one; there were 158 million of those people.It\u2019s easy to see how you can get to a much larger unemployment rate if you change your definition for either of those numbers. Take the B.L.S.\u2019s broadest definition of unemployment for example, known as U-6.U-6 includes not just those 7.8 million people who have actively sought work in the last four weeks, but also millions more who told a survey taker that they wanted a job and had looked for one in the last year, including those who say they\u2019re discouraged by economic conditions, along with people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. That measure of unemployment was 9.9 percent in January (or 10.5 percent if you want to cast aside the \u201cseasonal adjustment\u201d process that smooths out normal seasonal variation).But we don\u2019t have to restrict ourselves to the calculations that B.L.S. has done for us. With a little creativity we can come up with other definitions of unemployment that yield an even higher number.There are, after all, many millions of Americans who are of prime working age who are not working, not looking for a job, haven\u2019t looked for a job in the last year and yet in a healthier economy may well prefer to work.At the high point, in 1999, 84.6 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were working; now that is down to 81.1 percent. If we returned to the 1999 level, that would mean an additional 4.4 million working Americans. If we count those people \u2014 the missing workers \u2014 as unemployed, and tack them on to the definitions of unemployment included in U-6, we suddenly get to 20.1 million unemployed people and a 12.3 percent unemployment rate.But back to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the true unemployment rate is more like 28 or 35 or 42 percent. Is there any plausible way to come up with a jobless rate at those kinds of levels?As it happens, there is, and it\u2019s right there near the top of the monthly jobless report. Only 59.6 percent of the United States population was employed in January. On the other side of that, a whopping 40.4 percent of the population is not employed.If that is your definition of unemployed, well, yeah, the United States does have 40 percent unemployment. But keep in mind that this counts as unemployed every retiree, every college student, everyone who is unable to work because of a disability and every parent who voluntarily stays at home to raise a child.But surely we can find a way to make the unemployment rate seem higher still, right?I did some back-of-the-envelope math and came up with a way to get a jobless rate of about 53 percent! Instead of just including people 16 and above, the way the B.L.S. does, we could throw in those good-for-nothing children who are neither working, looking for work nor counted as part of the labor force.Like my 2-year-old niece, Lilia, who if you ask me has had it too easy for too long. I just hope the job she finds in the Trump administration involves finger-painting.An earlier version of this article misstated the population used to calculate a 40.4 percent jobless rate via the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Time-Honored Sport Looks to the Future", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On any given Sunday during football season, the N.F.L., a league that promotes itself as a standard-bearer of innovation, produces games that are analog at their core. The leather ball has been stitched the same way for decades, and the chain gangs hold the first-down markers like crossing guards at a busy street corner. The players smash into one another in a way a fan from a century ago would recognize.Yet the league, a $12-billion-a-year business, seems to be perpetually searching for the best and latest technology to help it deliver that analog product to its nearly 200 million fans, who are increasingly tech-savvy.The juxtaposition can be jarring.Enormous linemen push off one another in a shoving match that recalls something that could have taken place among heavyweights millenniums ago. And then those linemen head to the sideline and grab a tablet computer to scroll through high-definition photographs of their play.In a region filled with private equity titans, dreamy entrepreneurs and futurists, the N.F.L. has been eager to show off its technological chops this week.The Super Bowl host committee has also raised millions of dollars in donations from a range of technology giants, including Apple and Google, two companies not normally associated with the N.F.L. or other sports leagues.Google is paying for its shuttle buses to ferry Bay Area fans to and from the game. Apple is also running company buses to the game, and it has donated iPhones and laptops to the Super Bowl host committee. Still, neither company has pulled out the stops to throw its brand around here in the same way as many other companies.Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s executive vice president for media, is paid to rub shoulders with the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and any other company that will deliver the N.F.L. to fans in a way that complements, but does not dilute, its principal product: the games.While the league may be eager to deliver football to its fans on whatever device they want to use, he said, it is reluctant to let that technology bleed too far into the game.\u201cA lot of that comes from the No. 1 objective, is to keep the competition pure,\u201d Rolapp said moments after attending a panel discussion that included a description of HoloLens, a headset being developed by Microsoft that will show games in \u201caugmented reality.\u201d\u201cAll the stuff we talk about from a business perspective, if the game isn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus should be on the human competition. We\u2019re very protective of that.\u201dHoloLens is in its infancy, but Microsoft was eager to demonstrate to reporters how the device works. In a faux living room with a coffee table, a sofa and football-themed pillows, company technicians showed highlights from a Seahawks-49ers game on a flat-panel television.With the HoloLens headset on, you could see additional statistics to the left and right of the screen. The entire field was in view, not just the portion of the field shown on television. And on the coffee table, a hologram of a play appeared that could be started, stopped and rotated to better analyze the players on the field.Microsoft was careful to distinguish between virtual reality, in which viewers are immersed in a digital world, and HoloLens, which they called a mixed reality, with holograms, other images and data dropped into the field of vision. This, they said, is more complementary to the game.To an older generation of fans who grew up with a few games a week on network television and perhaps a highlight show or two in between, HoloLens may seem to be a high-tech distraction from the game.But the N.F.L. is more focused on younger fans. And if those fans are watching football in new ways and on new devices, then the N.F.L. would be foolhardy not to find ways to reach them.Phil de Picciotto, the president of Octagon Worldwide, a sports marketing agency, said: \u201cFootball, as the leading sports platform, is a reflection of society, and society is more technologically dependent, so it\u2019s logical that the N.F.L. will embrace technology.\u201dInnovative technology, de Picciotto added, has been a part of the N.F.L. for decades, such as the radio headsets in the helmets of quarterbacks and the Telestrator, the device that television analysts use to diagram plays on top of video. Most of these additions did not change the game but aimed to enhance it.What technology is unlikely to do, though, is fundamentally alter the game \u2014 the collisions, the Hail Mary passes, the fist pumps and the high-fives. At least for now.Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gates Explains How to Make Climate Progress in a World Eating Meat and Guzzling Gas", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "How the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest person plans to tackle global warming with a new multibillion-dollar fund.Below are\u00c2\u00a0his answers to a few of the hundreds of questions he received on The Times and on Facebook, covering everything from artificial meat to Americans\u2019 gas guzzling driving preferences (with some light editing of his dictated responses):For the full solution to the climate problem, we need such a dramatic reduction in emissions that only getting fuel from biofuels or by converting to electricity and then having the power grid generate no CO2 is the full solution. In the meantime, the less gasoline we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re burning the better off we are.People shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore the fact, though, that the demand is still somewhat driven by the tax credits and portfolio standards. So we still have quite a ways to go, particularly when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get from 20 percent of the energy sources up to the eventual 100 percent we need, where then you run into the big challenge of intermittency [dips and peaks in power as wind and solar sources vary] and the cost of adding storage that would deal with that. This makes the economics dramatically tougher because batteries haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improved that much. Now I and many other people are investing in companies that are going to try and see what we can do with batteries. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not guaranteed that their price will come down a lot. So solar and wind are great, but as they exist today, for countries like India, either in terms of cost or reliability, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get used substantially without innovations in cost and storage or alternative approaches.Being aware of those different costs, we know which things really bring dramatic greenhouse gas reductions, particularly given the goals, reflected in the Paris climate agreement, of getting close to zero emissions. Things that only cut you down even 50 percent, like switching to natural gas, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t achieve the 2050 goal. And so the Coalition will be scrutinizing biofuels to ask if they can be a big part of the solution. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed that people are now looking at the issue comprehensively. There are a lot of smart people looking at those conversion processes.~ ~ ~FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Skip the Upkeep and Rent the Jet, or Island, Instead", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byOwning an island is the quintessential \u201cI\u2019ve arrived\u201d declaration, but many among the well-heeled are arriving through an alternate route: They\u2019re renting.Ownership does not have the cachet it once commanded, and renting is shedding its d\u00e9class\u00e9 image. Even among the very wealthy who could easily afford to buy an island, renting simply makes more sense.And not just renting property. In other luxury categories, including exotic automobiles, designer frocks, private jets, flashy diamond jewelry, spacious villas and sleek yachts, the well-to-do are taking a cue from the broader shift to a sharing economy, epitomized by the ride-hailing service Uber, city bike programs and the peer-to-peer sharing of many goods and services.\u201cAffluent individuals are now recognizing the benefits of renting, as opposed to owning,\u201d she said, \u201cand are more open than ever to renting luxury vacation homes when they travel.\u201dMr. Vladi suggested another motivation: \u201cIf you own a property, you have to pay taxes, insurance, and manage the property. We can see it. There is a change in the market. They rent and have fun for two weeks, and then they go.\u201dBesides a budding enthusiasm for a more uncluttered lifestyle, patrons say these sharing-based services offer more convenience and choices.\u201cWhile some of our clients have owned yachts in the past, the allure of charter is that they have the freedom to choose any charter destination, anywhere in the world, selecting from a choice of different yachts,\u201d said Jeni Tidmarsh, director of Luxury Charter Group, a global company specializing in luxury yacht charters. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-strings relationship.\u201dHere are six luxury categories in which the rich are opting to rent.Many of the world\u2019s better-off choose to rent their vacation homes instead of buying for a range of reasons, including a desire to avoid burdens like maintenance and homeowner association, or HOA, fees.That is why Geoff Tracy, a Washington restaurateur, bought into Exclusive Resorts with his wife, Norah O\u2019Donnell, anchor of \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d It is \u201clike owning exquisite vacation homes all over the world without having the responsibility or the headaches that come with homeownership,\u201d he said. The starter plan costs $45,000 for 20 days over two years.\u201cI have a friend who owned a place in the Cayman Islands for years, but he got worn down with HOA fees, hurricane insurance, maintenance upkeep, etc.,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. \u201cNow he goes to the Caymans for the month of February every year. He pays ridiculous rent for a penthouse at a Ritz-Carlton community. But when the month is over, he simply leaves and has no worries the rest of the year and no carrying costs.\u201dThen too, there are tax considerations. \u201cAnother reason not to own property can have to do with residency and taxes,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. For \u201csomeone who has citizenship in a country where the tax system is based on residency\u201d \u2014 as it is in most European countries \u2014 \u201cit can make sense to rent to avoid becoming a tax resident.\u201d\u201cRenting vacation homes in St. Barth,\u201d she said, \u201cfits with their globe-trotting lifestyle and provides them with the flexibility needed for their superbusy schedules.\u201dRates for renting Musha Cay in the Bahamas, the 700-acre private island of the magician David Copperfield, start at $39,000 a night for a four-night minimum for up to 12 people (it can accommodate 24).A 25-hour jet card from Bloom Business Jets, for instance, allows purchase of individual flights on demand and permits selection of the specific jet type for each flight. Jet card rates range from $128,100 to $249,750, depending on the size of the jet.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to own their own plane because it\u2019s a big undertaking,\u201d said Steven W. Bloom, chief executive of Bloom Business Jets, whose charter business grew around 10 percent in the last year.But for most people, chartering\u2019s benefits are clear, he said. \u201cThe convenience and time savings, you don\u2019t have a big capital outlay, you don\u2019t have to manage the plane and the crew, and you just make one call and someone shows up with an airplane.\u201dThe disadvantages of chartering are that the plane is usually different every time, and its condition may vary.Many wealthy people \u201cdon\u2019t want the hassles of owning a yacht,\u201d said Ms. Tidmarsh of Luxury Charter Group.\u201cThey\u2019ve done the figures and realize they can charter the latest and greatest superyacht for a completely unique vacation, personalized for them, with none of the ongoing expenses of ownership,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s walk-on, walk-off convenience. There are no maintenance logistics or crew to manage, no cleaning, no paperwork and no ongoing invoices and expenses for berthing and upgrades.\u201dAn upside to chartering is that experts estimate it might easily cost $1 million annually to keep a $10 million mega-yacht running. Even for well-to-do yacht owners, fixed costs for fuel and paying a captain and crew, on top of docking fees and maintenance, can be formidable.David Spencer, 38, splits his time between New York and Los Angeles for his business, Talent Resources. Although he owns a 2015 BMW 750, when he is in California he prefers to rent a black Cadillac Escalade for up to three months at a time, at around $2,500 to $3,200 a month. He does that through the Exotic Car Collection of Enterprise, the rental car company.\u201cThey know my preferences,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cWhen I get off the five-hour plane in L.A., I like it to be streamlined. I don\u2019t have to deal with insuring, storing and maintaining the car.\u201dLuxury-car rentals are growing rapidly. Enterprise has expanded its Exotic Car Collection to 31 locations in the United States and Canada, recently adding two locations in Houston and one in Washington.\u201cThis rapid growth is evidence of the strong demand we continue to see for luxury rentals,\u201d said Brice Adamson, the senior vice president at Enterprise who oversees the Exotic Car Collection.Affluent customers who own similar luxury vehicles that are in the shop for repairs are behind some of the demand, Mr. Adamson said. Other renters include those who are shopping for new high-end autos and want to rent for a few days to get a feel for the ride.The company has raised $126 million in venture capital funding from investors that include Bain Capital Ventures, Highland Capital Partners and Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond\u00e9 Nast.After six years of steady expansion online, Rent the Runway has opened retail stores in New York, Chicago, Washington and Las Vegas, which serve as distribution centers for particular regions.Four-day rentals are $30 to $800 for apparel in sizes 0 to 22. Accessory rentals run $5 to $400. Many customers are professional women making six figures, who use the \u201cdelivered to your door\u201d service.The concept is unpretentious: Customers select a dress, rent it for four days and then return it to the company in a prepaid carrying case. Want to wear a Naeem Khan dress that retails for $5,180? It rents for $800 for four days. A Jason Wu leather handbag that retails for $1,965 rents for $300.\u201cIt\u2019s about being a smart shopper,\u201d said the chief executive and co-founder, Jennifer Hyman. \u201cMany clothing items have very low utility. Over 50 percent of a woman\u2019s closet women have worn three times or less.\u201d\u201cAnd there is the emotional depreciation of your clothes,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not as exciting to wear something the third time. And with all the social media, everyone sees what you have worn.\u201dAlso, owning a dress adds work to your life, Ms. Hyman said: \u201cYou have to care for it. You have to store it and dry-clean it.\u201d\u201cThere is a feeling of euphoria,\u201d she said, \u201cto only surrounding yourself with things that you need.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Boies\u2019s Dual Roles at Theranos Set Up Conflict", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorTheranos, a blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes when she was 19, is fighting for its survival. After reports in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about the company\u2019s technology, Theranos has been in a tailspin.The company\u2019s methodology and science are in doubt, a federal regulator found that one lab had violated several clinical standards and the drugstore chain Walgreens has suspended tests at a Theranos lab in California.Theranos is fighting back, claiming that its technology is valid and asserting that the facts will prevail as its technology is scientifically tested.At the center of the company\u2019s defense is Mr. Boies, a founder and the chairman of Boies Schiller & Flexner.Mr. Boies is known as one of the smartest and shrewdest litigators in the country. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential dispute, he litigated the Microsoft antitrust case for the federal government, and he is representing Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, in his suit against the government.In the wake of the questions being asked about Theranos, the company hired Mr. Boies. He had represented Theranos before and his firm\u2019s ties with the company ran deep. The general counsel of Theranos is a former Boies Schiller partner.That Mr. Boies is representing an embattled client is nothing new. But this time, the lawyer has raised the ante by becoming a director of Theranos.Let\u2019s stop here and note that this has the potential to blow up. Mr. Boies is taking on two different roles at Theranos. A lawyer represents a client \u2014 here Theranos \u2014 while a director, even at a privately held company like Theranos, represents the company\u2019s investors.Depending on what unfolds at Theranos, Mr. Boies may be put in a position where he either has to protect the company (as its lawyer) or the shareholders (as a director).I asked one of my colleagues, Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in business ethics, about this potential conflict. She was skeptical of Mr. Boies\u2019s dual role.\u201cI have a hard time believing that an experienced litigator can adequately represent investors \u2014 one of the primary responsibilities of a director \u2014 while being attentive to potential legal strategies, which might cause him to privilege the interests of management,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt just seems a difficult line to walk.\u201dNo doubt Theranos waived the conflict in lots of documented forms. And the American Bar Association does allow this type of dual role. But just because a conflict is allowed doesn\u2019t mean it will not lead to problems.If the technology of Theranos turns out to be not what it claims, investors would almost certainly seek to sue the chief executive, Ms. Holmes, and the company, as well as the board that allowed this to happen.This gets complicated for Mr. Boies, because Theranos is a corporate governance disaster.Ms. Holmes controls the company, and she solidified that control in 2013 by arranging for the company to adopt a high-vote stock structure that gave her most of the votes. This is a problem because the company is essentially Ms. Holmes, although it has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from outside investors. She founded it, had the idea and has led the technology. If the technology is shown to be flawed, she may not be quick to admit that to the benefit of the remaining shareholders.Mr. Boies, of course, is no expert in blood testing technology. But in evaluating the firm\u2019s technology, he will get little to no help from his fellow board members. Before the first Journal article appeared, the board of Theranos had no outside scientific experience. It consisted mainly of statesmen, including two former senators and even Henry Kissinger. Most of these board members have now been demoted to advisers.The Theranos board is now five people, including Ms. Holmes and the company\u2019s chief operating officer. None of the rest have scientific experience. Two other directors are a retired Marine Corps general and the chief executive of Bechtel, the construction company. Then there is Mr. Boies.This is, frankly, a weak board and another potential land mine for Mr. Boies, as the weakness of the board does not lessen the fiduciary duty he has to all Theranos shareholders.The potential for conflict is particularly great. What if Ms. Holmes resists changes that would be in the interest of shareholders? What if the board decides that it is time for her to go \u2014 and she stands her ground?The board could do little more than throw up its collective hands under the current governance structure.Mr. Boies, and the other outside directors, could resign in protest. But why would anyone, particularly Mr. Boies, be a director on a board that lacked the power to make fundamental changes?A request for comment to Boies Schiller was referred to a representative who declined to comment. Theranos did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.There is also a lesson for those venture capitalists who invested in Theranos.The recent bubbly years when unicorns \u2014 start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more \u2014 seemed to emerge almost daily led venture capitalists to agree to governance structures that placed all power with the founder. After all, this is a structure that worked for Facebook.But Theranos is no Facebook. That Theranos had no real board in place and took repeated steps to place all power with Ms. Holmes may not have been a problem when Theranos was a start-up darling. But now, Theranos has fallen and will have to prove itself. Governance matters most in crisis times, and Theranos lacks it, to the chagrin of its investors. Even Mark Zuckerberg put together a real board and hired Sheryl Sandberg as a check.One has to wish Mr. Boies luck. If Theranos turns wildly successful, then there will be no problem. But if its troubles continue, he will have to do something he is less experienced at \u2014 be a director and corporate leader. The question will be whether the litigator in him will prevent that.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

Presses Congress to Settle iPhone Privacy Fight", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOther technology companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo \u2014 also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201dThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201dIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201dApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201dA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201dApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked information about the government\u2019s mass surveillance programs.Katie Benner and Nick Wingfield reported from San Francisco and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.

The session began with government officials admitting their shortcomings in tackling the explosion of activity by terrorist groups online.John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, started the meeting by saying that federal law enforcement had struggled to reach audiences that were responding to recruitment by violent extremists, according to the participant. Nick Rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, lauded some social media platforms for aggressively taking down accounts of suspected terrorists.The hourslong meeting, which took place at the Justice Department, also included speeches by Megan Smith, the national chief technology officer; and Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism.The event was another step toward coordinating government and private sector efforts on national security. After the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., last year, the White House and presidential candidates have pushed for Internet firms to clamp down on the use of social media by extremists to recruit new members, organize and broadcast their demands.Wednesday\u2019s gathering was attended by company executives but few, if any, chief executives. Participants included representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr and Microsoft.Many of the tech companies are willing to work on ways to combat violent extremism on social media. The meeting on Wednesday, called the \u201cMadison Valleywood Project,\u201d in reference to the participation of marketing, tech and entertainment firms, focused on terrorists\u2019 use of social media to organize and recruit members for violent extremism.The subject of encryption and Apple\u2019s resistance to being ordered to break through its encrypted software for law enforcement was not on the agenda.\u201cOver the past year, organizations and companies across a range of industries have asked how they might contribute to efforts to counter radicalization and recruitment activities by ISIL and other violent extremists,\u201d said Marc Raimondi, the Justice Department\u2019s national security spokesman, using a term for the Islamic State.\u201cThe U.S. government recognizes that these private sector actors, which include N.G.O.s, social media companies and content producers, have a crucial role to play in developing creative and effective ways to undermine terrorist recruiting and counter the call to violence,\u201d Mr. Raimondi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byIn Silicon Valley \u2014 if not Washington \u2014 Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud.That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple\u2019s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology.ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \u2014 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed.Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\u2019s cooperation and its resistance is \u201ctechnically able.\u201dIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\u2019s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.That could include iCloud, if Apple can figure out a consumer-friendly way to keep the data under lock and key \u2014 a key Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to use \u2014 without making it inconvenient for people who need to retrieve backups.That is no simple feat. Apple would have to find a way to let users retrieve their own data safely even without the company\u2019s help, while keeping out hackers and other sorts of data thieves.None of this iCloud discussion would apply to iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary text messaging service. It uses technology called end-to-end encryption, which means messages sent using iMessage cannot be intercepted and decrypted. Only the sender and receiver, not Apple, have the keys to read such messages. Apple retains encrypted iMessages on its servers until they are read by the user or expire after several days.For now, the best bet to protect your personal information from snoops may be to keep it off iCloud \u2014 and the many, many apps that may pass or store unencrypted information through data centers. It is safer on your device.Just try not to drop your phone in a swimming pool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philip Knight of Nike to Give $400 Million to Stanford Scholars", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byPhilip H. Knight, the co-founder and chairman of Nike Inc., said on Monday that he had pledged to give Stanford University $400 million to recruit graduate students around the globe to address society\u2019s most intractable problems, including poverty and climate change.The gift to the new Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program, which is modeled on the Rhodes scholarships, matches one of the largest individual donations ever to a university, the $400 million that John A. Paulson, the hedge fund tycoon, gave to Harvard last year to improve its engineering school. The Stanford project is meant to improve the world.\u201cThis is using education to benefit mankind and I think it really could be transformative,\u201d Mr. Knight said in a phone interview. \u201cI jumped on it right away.\u201dIts ambitious mandate is the brainchild of Stanford\u2019s president, John L. Hennessy, a computer scientist and tech entrepreneur, who plans to step down this summer. During his 16-year tenure, Mr. Hennessy nurtured the school\u2019s symbiotic relationship with Silicon Valley and increased Stanford\u2019s endowment to more than $22 billion from about $9 billion in 2000.The program, which will be announced on Wednesday at Stanford, has raised $750 million, making it one of the largest fully funded scholarship endowments in the world.According to the Council for Aid to Education, less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s colleges received 28.7 percent of all gifts in 2015.The former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is now a professor at Stanford, called it \u201can exciting place at the heart of Silicon Valley.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people are innovating all the time and it can attract the best people from all over the world.\u201dMr. Knight, a graduate of Stanford\u2019s business school, gave that institution $105 million in 2006. Over the past 20 years, he has donated hundreds of millions to the University of Oregon, where he received his undergraduate degree.Not every gift pledged by Mr. Knight has gone smoothly. In 2000, he withdrew a $30 million pledge to expand the University of Oregon\u2019s football stadium after the school allied itself with a labor group that was critical of Nike factories overseas. The university president later reversed the decision and Mr. Knight restored the gift.The Knight-Hennessy scholarship is not unique, but Mr. Knight may well be the rare billionaire benefactor who is willing to share top billing. \u201cI think locking my name in with his for decades to come is an honor,\u201d Mr. Knight said.Mr. Hennessy described the fellowships as his legacy. \u201cA few years ago I started to think about the one thing I could do at Stanford that could make a difference for the world in a bigger setting,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWe could bring the best students from around the world to Stanford and produce a string of leaders educated in making positive change.\u201dStarting in 2018, the program will annually offer full tuition and board to 100 students \u2014 a third of them from the United States and two-thirds from abroad \u2014 who will gain admittance to one of Stanford\u2019s seven graduate schools and commit to working on important issues in small, multidisciplinary teams.One problem Mr. Hennessy said he might assign to a team is to analyze the $100 million donation that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, made to Newark public schools in 2010, and that has not been widely seen as a success. \u201cNobody understood the real difficulty in making significant change in the public education system,\u201d Mr. Hennessy said. His scholars would be asked, he added, \u201c \u2018How do you build a structure that will successfully deploy those funds for the benefit of all?\u2019 \u201dMr. Hennessy said he was confident that this money would be well spent. \u201cTo say we can solve all the world\u2019s problems is na\u00efve,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say we can educate people to make a significant difference in trying to solve those problems \u2014 that\u2019s an achievable goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byTech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without.So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction.At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel \u201cReady Player One\u201d is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from \u201cStar Trek.\u201dBut how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers.\u201cScience fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,\u201d said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses.Much of the action in the book takes place inside the Oasis, a global virtual reality network. Characters in the network attend school, socialize and take part in a high-stakes treasure hunt. Through virtual reality, they can inhabit the perspectives of actors in classic movies.\u201cOne of the things I like about \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 is all of the depictions in the book are pretty feasible,\u201d Mr. Luckey said. \u201cNone of it is crazy, far-out tech.\u201dOculus gave out 3,000 copies of the book to attendees of an Oculus developer conference last year. For good measure, Oculus named the meeting rooms at its headquarters after famous fictional versions of virtual reality, including the holodeck, the Oasis and the Matrix, from the movie of the same name and, before that, William Gibson\u2019s \u201cNeuromancer.\u201dMr. Cline said he wrote \u201cReady Player One\u201d partly because he could not figure out why virtual reality had not taken off in the real world.But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace \u2014 and often someone \u2014 they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters.In an interview, Mr. Stephenson \u2014 whose title is chief futurist \u2014 declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several \u201ccontent projects\u201d underway at the company.More broadly, Mr. Stephenson said science fiction books and movies are often useful within tech companies for rallying employees around a shared vision.\u201cMy theory is that science fiction can actually have some value in that it gets everyone on the same page without the kind of expensive and tedious process of PowerPoint,\u201d he said. But the influence of the genre within tech companies is \u201csurprising and mysterious to me as well,\u201d he added.There is a regular theme in science fiction that its fans in tech talk less about, though: the dystopian aspects of virtual reality. Addiction, disconnection from relationships in the real world and alienation from the environment are often side effects in narratives about virtual reality. It\u2019s hard to make that into a selling point for the technology.\u201cEntrepreneurs are optimistic and upbeat by nature, which is why I enjoy hanging around with them,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an admirable ability to completely ignore the more dystopian elements you\u2019re talking about and see the cool stuff and positive potential of where it might go.\u201dOf course, authors and moviemakers get to overlook details of their own \u2014 like the tough technological challenges that real tech companies face.\u201cYou never have to reboot the damned thing\u201d in sci-fi books, said Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist who works at Intel and has written about the interplay between technology and science fiction. \u201cThe mechanics are less interesting to most science fiction writers than the experience.\u201dSometimes science fiction plants seeds in the minds of inventors that take years to sprout. The holographic chess game that Chewbacca played on a tabletop aboard the Millennium Falcon was pretty far-out in the 1970s, when Jeri Ellsworth saw it in the original \u201cStar Wars.\u201d It took decades for technology to catch up.In 2013, Ms. Ellsworth\u2019s start-up, CastAR, gave the first public demonstration of the company\u2019s augmented reality glasses, which overlay digital imagery on the user\u2019s view of the real world.\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been dreaming about my entire life,\u201d Ms. Ellsworth said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Filters That Add a Dash of Dazzle to Smartphone Photos", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byApp SmartWhen I learned about photography years ago, one of my favorite tricks with the camera was to use a filter \u2014 perhaps a color gel or a diffuser \u2014 to add a special effect to the final photograph.Now I can do the same thing on my smartphone, thanks to photo filter apps. Many of the apps are badly made, but we have sorted through some that are worth trying.Colorburn works best when you use the camera system in the app to take your photos, because doing so offers a chance to see the effect live on your camera screen and tweak it or select a different effect. The app also works on photos you\u2019ve already snapped, either with your phone\u2019s built-in camera or a different photography app.Among my favorite Colorburn features are image editing for contrast and cutout filters that let you frame your photo in a square, a heart or another shape. Extra filters and effects are available via in-app purchase for $1 or more. Controlling the individual effects is easy thanks to the app\u2019s clear editing controls.Colorburn\u2019s downside? There is so much choice in filters and effects that mastering its many menus and controls and deciding which of the 1,000-plus image options you want to use can be difficult.Infltr\u2019s quirky filter interface really influences how you use it. Because it reacts to swipes so quickly and you can\u2019t fine-tune each effect, it forces you to swipe to find a great look and to snap your photo quickly. This means you may end up trying filters that you would normally not choose in a photo app like Instagram.Some reviewers lament the lack of fine control over each special effect in Infltr. The app also specializes mainly in colored filters instead of more eye-catching ones like vignetting and color inversion. It costs $3.This app has an interface with bold, clear icons and controls. Its filters are organized into sections like \u201cartmodern,\u201d \u201ccolor\u201d and more, and each filter is previewed with a little on-screen icon. The preview helps you choose how bold the final result is with a simple slider. Unlike some rival apps, Pixlr also allows you to apply the filter over the whole image or only to particular regions that you indicate by drawing on-screen.Pixlr also has comprehensive photo editing features like red-eye removal, text overlay and more. The app is supported by ads, but if you\u2019re annoyed by e pop-ups, they can be removed by paying $2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Plumbs Ocean\u2019s Depths to Test Underwater Data Center", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byMicrosoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industry\u2019s most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill.Today\u2019s data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash.Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity.The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity.\u201cWhen I first heard about this I thought, \u2018Water ... electricity, why would you do that?\u2019 \u201d said Ben Cutler, a Microsoft computer designer who is one of the engineers who worked on the Project Natick system. \u201cBut as you think more about it, it actually makes a lot of sense.\u201dSuch a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage.The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the world\u2019s population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users.\u201cFor years, the main cloud providers have been seeking sites around the world not only for green energy but which also take advantage of the environment,\u201d said Larry Smarr, a physicist and scientific computing specialist who is director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.Driven by technologies as varied as digital entertainment and the rapid arrival of the so-called Internet of Things, the demand for centralized computing has been growing exponentially. Microsoft manages more than 100 data centers around the globe and is adding more at a rapid clip. The company has spent more than $15 billion on a global data center system that now provides more than 200 online services.In 2014, engineers in a branch of Microsoft Research known as New Experiences and Technologies, or NExT, began thinking about a novel approach to sharply speed up the process of adding new power to so-called cloud computing systems.\u201cWhen you pull out your smartphone you think you\u2019re using this miraculous little computer, but actually you\u2019re using more than 100 computers out in this thing called the cloud,\u201d said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research and the NExT organization. \u201cAnd then you multiply that by billions of people, and that\u2019s just a huge amount of computing work.\u201dThe company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule \u2014 eight feet in diameter \u2014 that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected.The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night.The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service.The research group has started designing an underwater system that will be three times as large. It will be built in collaboration with a yet-to-be-chosen developer of an ocean-based alternative-energy system. The Microsoft engineers said they expected a new trial to begin next year, possibly near Florida or in Northern Europe, where there are extensive ocean energy projects underway.The first prototype, affectionately named Leona Philpot \u2014 a character in Microsoft\u2019s Halo video game series \u2014 has been returned, partly covered with barnacles, to the company\u2019s corporate campus here.It is a large white steel tube, covered with heat exchangers, with its ends sealed by metal plates and large bolts. Inside is a single data center computing rack that was bathed in pressurized nitrogen to efficiently remove heat from computing chips while the system was tested on the ocean floor.The idea for the underwater system came from a research paper written in 2014 by several Microsoft data center employees, including one with experience on a Navy submarine.Norman A. Whitaker, the managing director for special projects at Microsoft Research and a former deputy director of the Information Innovation Office at the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, said the underwater server concept was an example of what scientists at Darpa called \u201crefactoring,\u201d or completely rethinking the way something has traditionally been accomplished.Even if putting a big computing tube underwater seems far-fetched, the project could lead to other innovations, he said. For example, the new undersea capsules are designed to be left in place without maintenance for as long as five years. That means the servers inside it have to be hardy enough to last that long without needing repairs.That would be a stretch for most servers, but they will have to improve in order to operate in the underwater capsule \u2014 something the Microsoft engineers say they are working on.They\u2019re also rethinking the physical alignment of data centers. Right now, servers are put in racks so they can be maintained by humans. But when they do not need maintenance, many parts that are just there to aid human interaction can be removed, Mr. Whitaker said.\u201cThe idea with refactoring is that it tickles a whole bunch of things at the same time,\u201d he said.In the first experiment, the Microsoft researchers said they studied the impact their computing containers might have on fragile underwater environments. They used acoustic sensors to determine if the spinning drives and fans inside the steel container could be heard in the surrounding water. What they found is that the clicking of the shrimp that swam next to the system drowned out any noise created by the container.One aspect of the project that has the most obvious potential is the harvest of electricity from the movement of seawater. This could mean that no new energy is added to the ocean and, as a result, there is no overall heating, the researchers asserted. In their early experiment the Microsoft engineers said they had measured an \u201cextremely\u201d small amount of local heating of the capsule.\u201cWe measured no heating of the marine environment beyond a few inches from the vessel,\u201d Dr. Lee said.An article on Monday about Microsoft\u2019s testing of underwater data centers misstated the title of Norman Whitaker, Microsoft\u2019s managing director for special projects, when he was at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He was a former deputy director of the agency\u2019s Information Innovation Office; he was not the former deputy director of Darpa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gates, the \u2018Impatient Optimist,\u2019 Lays Out his Clean-Energy Innovation Agenda", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "I recently had a 45-minute conversation with Gates in the Seattle headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore what drove him to focus so much time and money in pursuit of energy breakthroughs.Andrew Revkin talks to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest person about his plan to tackle global warming with a new multibillion-dollar fund.Do you have a vision for the energy and climate norms that the world could have in 2100, given what you know about the climate system and the energy system?Well, I have a strong goal that the price of energy should be lower because of the work of the foundation and looking at the lives of the poorest. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very big deal that we not push energy prices up too much, so that things like fertilizer, lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning eventually \u2014 the kinds of things we take for granted \u2014 by 2100 should be available to everyone on the planet. So we need affordable energy.To me it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor people are farmers, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re barely getting by. And a bad year means that their kid doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough nutrition. And so unless we can get their productivity and their resilience up quite dramatically, the increased variance in the weather, including lots of precipitation all at once, they just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the ability to deal with it. When you have resilience, which you have in rich countries, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to be able to make adjustments.Well for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to think of research and innovation as the thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going change the framework. And my interest in getting that on the agenda goes back quite a ways. I had talked to the United States and France about saying, hey, shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this be on the agenda? And in fact, in terms of having Paris be novel for driving solutions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do the world a service by getting this onto the agenda. After all, raising R&D is a global public good, to invent something that can solve this problem.So it really belongs on this agenda, particularly because the big emitters are pretty much one and the same as the countries with research capacity. They can respond by tilting their R&D budget in the right direction. And energy is so unique in terms of how little is spent on R&D, because if you invent something, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be deployed in big amounts within a 20-year period.So yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonderful that the countries made that commitment. And at first we thought, you know, if we get five or six countries, including the U.S. and a few big countries, that would be phenomenal. As it was, we ended up with 20 countries, and this is in a time of extremely tight budgets \u2014 every European country, Japan, the U.S.It is very tough. There are very few things that are getting more money. Most of the dialogue is about which things will get less money. So it takes a pretty compelling cause. You know, like when the Ebola epidemic came along. Okay, things related to that got more money.But only things that really get people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention in a big way are allowed to fit that special category. So it was a great announcement. And it was interesting, the idea that the private sector, in terms of high-risk venture investing, would come in and be there so that all we were asking for in this case was the basic research piece. Now, some countries may help with non-research pieces. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic. But this ask was about the piece that really can only be done at the government level. And we said the group of private investors \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a lot of institutional investors as well \u2014 would bring several billion in so that we can nurture these companies up to a pretty large stage, so that more non-venture type financing would then grab onto them and help with the scale-up.Is it anticipated that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to operate like an endowment?What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning now is the first five years. And the spending will somewhat grow over the years, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more companies that are at a later stage. We are going to look at all the companies that are out there, because there are a few that have promising technologies, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a place where getting financing is a little bit difficult. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just going to do start-up companies. We may find a few that are at the stage where getting $50 million or even $100 million would be valuable. And then over the five years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fully invest money, and then, like most venture funds, we would turn around and say to the investors, hey, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy with this, yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do another fund.Are you saying, we wealthy individuals with an investment plan here, we need a hand-off. We need you to work on this, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like a quid pro quo thing?It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as fast. But we do expect to make money out of this thing. If you can drive a new approach, then the energy economy is absolutely gigantic. Now, getting it scaled up fast enough, so that you benefit from your invention or your trade secrets, that is tricky. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that we have that incentive. The financial incentive is to get it out and scaled quickly, and the climate benefit requires that same mentality.Is there a way to make that case to the American people that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been made? You talk to people of all political stripes, I assume. Have you found a way to get traction with the logic of that?Well, research hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been discussed much, but I do think it has a lot of appeal. Everyone wants great companies that are leading the way. We do have amazing universities where the basic technology, the material science, the simulation. You know, the I.Q. around the world large is very strong on this \u2014 to make the case to the U.S. that it should be a leader in doubling its budget. That was pretty important. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think if the U.S. wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t participating, it would be easy to get critical mass. Because even though we underspend, we are about 50 percent of all of the energy R&D spending that gets done.I think everybody can get excited when they hear there are really ideas out there. And when you talk about basic research, you get away from the somewhat partisan divide about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the role of government. Nobody would say it was zero, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get quite a range of views of how much the government ought to try and help out at that later stage.And so I think this one, now that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been highlighted as being so important, it you know, creates jobs in the company that allocates the R&D, it creates business opportunity in the country. And as you say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not relative to the size of the energy market or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at risk here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually very, very small. You know, capitalism in general underinvests in research because the benefits to society are way more than whoever takes the risk and does the invention gets. And energy is just particularly dramatic in that. In fact, I.T. and health, people are spoiled by those, because those have pretty strong research models, both at the government level and at the private level.Circling back to Paris, could you lay out the general sectors you personally are interested in, and inevitably these investments will be in? Can you remind people what some of the basic concepts are that are out there?The range of possibilities for getting an energy breakthrough that is something that will be cheap and clean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few ways to do that. Ah, in the nuclear space there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fusion; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fission.Within wind, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got high [altitude] wind that only a little bit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done in. You have offshore wind, you have whatever improvements you can do to onshore wind, which you know, will likely be a workhorse of the overall system. Then in solar, you have solar electric, which has gone the furthest. You can do a lot more there. You have solar thermal, which has some nice characteristics, because storing heat is easier than storing electrons.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a paradigmatic example because it is not ready for a start-up, but there are some particular problems in terms of material structures and simulation that, if the right research was done, even over the next two or three years, then you could have a set of start-ups that would go into that area.High wind is another one where the challenges are, to some degree, control and materials challenges. This is the golden age of actually rationally designing materials, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for tensile strength or for catalytic capabilities. And if you can look at that area and say, okay scientists, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we need, then you can stimulate a lot of good work. And for us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit like what we do at the foundation where we take a disease problem and then we try and make sure the scientists who might \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have some tool that would help stimulate them to get involved.Biofuels is a category where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either taking natural photosynthesis or modifying natural photosynthesis to get much higher efficiencies, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few, you know: trees, grasses, algae. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking current photosynthesis, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many ways to do cellulosic processing, none of which should have gotten into the large-scale mainstream, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of promise that that might happen.And when we think about climate, we have to think about more than electricity. We have to make materials. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steel, aluminum, cement, plastic, paper \u2014 all of which are big processes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dependent on, some of which directly generate CO2, like cement production, and a lot of which are big industrial users of electricity or energy. We also have the entire land use, agricultural, livestock area, which is a very significant CO2 emitter.A little bit of the trap people get into is they think, okay if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re meeting some 2030 goal, we must be on the way, because we just do more of what we did. Well, a lot of things you do, like, take [away] coal and build natural gas, for your 2050 goal, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a step backwards because that gas plant is at a higher CO2-per-kilowatt-hour than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want to have in 2050. So you thought, oh what a great thing we just did. But in fact it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale to the sort of near-zero [emissions technology] that we need to achieve.So when you think of the industrial economy, getting 20 or 30 percent out of that by pushing up recycling, labeling things, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy. But you have to plan today for meeting the large target. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just get to get partway there and say, oh well someone else will figure out how to make steel or, you know, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to make a lot of steel.Well there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a couple ways that it could come in. Poor countries, even if we figure out how to take livestock and land use in rich countries and get that down to zero, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going be a lot of emissions out of poor countries. And we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force them not to use hydrocarbons. People actually get confused in climate and think this is bad for poor countries so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get them to do expensive intermittent energy systems and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay.No, developing and truly poor countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not China or India \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are a rounding error. So anything you do with their energy systems is a hobby, unrelated to climate change. I mean, maybe you could bring some power there, but they should grab onto the cheapest solution.So doing carbon sequestration out of a natural gas [power plant] flue is a lot easier than out of a coal flue, because there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the sulfuric acid. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little going on with that, but we may need that as part of a solution for that backup peaker 20 percent. Or if you have emissions taking place far away, in the poor countries, the idea that you could do free air capture, like Carbon Engineering is trying to do and a few other people are trying to do \u2014 that would have to be part of the mix.So actually, building prototypes now and saying, okay, how hard is it to do that carbon capture at scale, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that that work is going on. The initial plants will be at very high prices \u2014 on the order of $100 per ton, which is way above even the highest CO2 tax in the world.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like them to be more visible, more integrated perhaps into how kids are learning.You and I grew up in the space race, you know, it was a no-brainer. Science was all around us. But do you see a way to make this story more pervasive?And I would like a boiler room tour in every school in America. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to charter buses. There are no permission slips, and you start to understand an energy system within a school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be great to see innovation on that front. Maybe not as much as the innovation in laboratories for photovoltaics. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a communicator and an educator, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m biased \u2014 but I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of potential in that arena for innovation, as well. You should go on that boiler room tour. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great template.Not really. Not if your electricity coming in is zero CO2. If the electricity system isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about zero CO2, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to get there. I mean, just ignore the U.S. Assume we could cut some dramatic amount. Just look at India. They will be using over 10 times as much energy. And, yes, some of those light bulbs will be more efficient. Some of those refrigerators will be more efficient. But they will be using more kilowatt-hours. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not any doubt. A lot more. The more the better. And so the generation system really has to do the magical work here.And there are generation systems. I mean, nuclear has got lots of lots of problems, but it does not emit CO2. Hydro, if you manage it properly and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with a reservoir and everything, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to emit CO2.But I certainly agree with you that this is a problem that you can go from thinking it will be solved to thinking that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be solved.And even some of the people who think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to be solved can be frustrating to me, because then the idea of oh no we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to invent anything, we just need to get rid of evil utilities that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying 50 cents a kilowatt-hour for rooftop solar, and as soon as we get them to just realize they should go bankrupt, you know, boom, this thing is solved. It is a very hard problem to solve, because energy systems have to be reliable. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a utility, you are supposed to buy low-cost energy on behalf of those consumers. Utilities are not there to spend money on global public goods, which is what CO2 reduction is.Well India is paradigmatic. And you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 1.4 billion people. So they have to electrify. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why children don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die. They need to be able to refrigerate their food and heat and cool. And so if you think you have a solution that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slow down India improving the lives of their people to be almost as good as what we take for granted, if you think today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology solves the India problem with no price premium, no reliability problem, then great. Go to India, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a capitalistic market there. Go ahead and do that. That is when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on our way.Then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saying to them, trade off between these two things. Yes, the United States could afford for energy to cost a lot more than it does today. Europe can afford for energy to cost a lot more. Japan can afford for it to cost a lot more. But the future CO2 emitters are not going to pay some meaningful premium, nor are they going to give up total reliability. Their hospitals want energy; their factories want energy all the time.Well I call myself the impatient optimist, because I want things to go faster. With something like an HIV vaccine, you know, there are a lot of dead ends. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to believe that eventually you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find one and you want to pursue a lot of different things. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very optimistic, you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting smarter all the time, ah, about how to do that. So it really won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight.Well, in software, nobody at Microsoft is sitting there saying, oh yeah, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 2040 thing going look like? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ridiculously long time period, even for a health-care type intervention, to try and think, hey we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing this great work so that we have this tool for 25 years from now.But for good reason \u2014 safety tests and capital costs and just the time it takes to build large-scale things \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time frame that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in. If that is part of the solution, which is hard to say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really glad the work is being done. It has some meaningful chance of being able to help us with the climate problem.~ ~ ~ ~ReflectionsThis is mainly because I so often see\u00c2\u00a0a natural human bias toward the here and now \u2014 the low fruit \u2014 that tends to downplay the need to work now to build the intellectual and technical capacity for bigger changes later.With that in mind, one result of Gates\u2019s research campaign appears to be some constructive competition from other wealthy investors pursuing financial, instead of technological, breakthroughs.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRadical innovation in low-carbon energy technology is critical to long term climate mitigation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolfensohn said. But he said he and others are exploring the creation of an investors\u2019 coalition, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplementary to the Gates initiative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d aimed\u00c2\u00a0at overcoming a different set of barriers to progress.\u201cFinancing renewables is fundamentally different than fossil energy,\u201d he said, noting, for example, that different investment vehicles are needed when there is a high capital cost up front and extremely low costs for energy in the end.\u00c2\u00a0\u201cEnergy efficiency,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is such a key part of the solution, is financed from avoided cost as opposed to revenue, which is its own challenge.\u201dHe described a host of new tools and approaches to financing that could, with an innovative push, \u201covercome those barriers to deployment that lie solely with the financing market, not with the technology.\u201dHere\u2019s an excerpt from the Gates Letter that helps define terms \u2014 a vital first step before debating the merits of different policies:Defining terms good start in hashing out clean-energy paths. @BillGates\u2019s take on \u201cmiracles\u201d https://t.co/E3suy2dIKy https://t.co/W3UORWRUosSolar and Livelihood \u2013 Solar Powered Sewing Machine being used in Manipur, India //t.co/iXzHVX1QfZ\u201cBill Gates Is Wrong That We Need \u00e2\u0080\u0098Energy Miracles\u2019 \u201d by Joe Romm for @ClimateProgress: https://t.co/BNbrBIUrRm.@BillGates Can oil majors be part of the clean-energy innovation agenda, directly or indirectly, or are they hopeless dinosaurs? @RevkinGood interview, but that\u2019s absurd.

{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Tried to Protect His Name From Others Who Shared It", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byGrace NotesLike Donald J. Trump before he became a Republican presidential candidate or a reality-television personality, Jules and Eddie Trump are real estate developers, and rich.He claimed that their use of the Trump name was \u201cdesigned to reap the benefits\u201d of his. He also said it constituted unfair competition.The brothers, in fact, had the name first, although they did not make that argument in the case. Jules Trump is 72. Eddie Trump is 69, the same age as Donald. But Eddie, born in April 1946, is two months older.If they were arguing the case now, the lawyers could mention more recent tussles over names. In 2010, a former Los Angeles drug kingpin known as Freeway Ricky Ross sued the Miami rapper who performed as Rick Ross. Last year, an appellate judge in California ruled in favor of the rap star, who was born William Leonard Roberts and was a correction officer before he became a performer. The judge, Roger Boren, said Mr. Roberts\u2019s use of a stage name was protected by the First Amendment.In the Trump case, Donald said in court papers that he had received inquiries from financial institutions about deals that the other Trumps were considering. He said that the calls pointed to confusion over which Trumps were which.After an inquiry from a magazine publisher \u2014 David Q. Mahler, the vice president of a company that owned trade magazines \u2014 Donald Trump went to court.\u201cWelcome to the chain drugstore industry,\u201d Mr. Mahler wrote in a letter, urging Donald Trump to follow \u201cother leaders in the field\u201d and \u201cbecome an active subscriber\u201d to one of his magazines, Drugstore News.He was soliciting the wrong Trump. A unit of Jules and Eddie\u2019s company had just acquired a drugstore chain called Pay \u2019n Save, and Mr. Mahler knew all about the company. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t work with a better group of executives than those that are part of Pay \u2019n Save management,\u201d he wrote.Donald Trump eventually lost the case in State Supreme Court, but he had a two-pronged legal strategy. He had petitioned the federal Patent and Trademark Office to revoke the registration of the Trump Group\u2019s trademark, which it did. The brothers could continue to use the name Trump Group, which they have, but they lost the legal benefits of having a trademark in 1988.So, as Donald Trump said in a telephone interview on Friday, \u201cI got the name.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re also really nice guys,\u201d he said of the other Trumps. \u201cI\u2019m friends with them. They\u2019re quality guys. They do quality developments. I see them around, sometimes at the U.S. Open tennis. Really nice guys.\u201dDid he know that when he sued them? Did he know them then? \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI never sue people that I know if I like them. I didn\u2019t know them, and then I got to know them after that.\u201dFor his part, Jules Trump\u2019s response to a reporter\u2019s call about the lawsuits was, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019ve never been any issues with him since then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, we\u2019ve engaged socially, and it was fine.\u201dDonald Trump got the name. Would he get Jules Trump\u2019s vote?\u201cHe\u2019s a remarkable person, he\u2019s an incredible person,\u201d he said. He paused, and then added: \u201cWhether I\u2019d vote for him? I\u2019m not getting into my political preferences.\u201dBut reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that he gave $25,000 to Conservative Solutions PAC, which is supporting Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida.Advertisement"}

Trump removed himself from the Republican debate last week and threw a huge public relations party for himself, he did what many politicians before him have done: He cynically used United States military veterans to elevate his own political standing. His alt-rally, called a \u201cSpecial Event to Benefit Veterans Organizations,\u201d held in Des Moines, was the type of circus we\u2019ve come to expect from the former reality TV star turned politician.Thankfully, the candidate stopped short of ringleading a few acts under his big top \u2014 no Marines on the overhead trapeze, Navy SEALs balancing balls on their noses or Special Forces walking the tightrope.The circus had nothing to do with those who serve this country; we know that he was sticking it to Fox News and the \u201cmean\u201d moderator Megyn Kelly. But like many before him, Mr. Trump saw an opportunity and seized it.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t invent this particular brand of hypocrisy; he just employed it a bit more flagrantly. Politicians from both parties have used warriors as photo ops and speech fodder ever since Abraham Lincoln posed with his generals for Mathew Brady at Antietam.In Des Moines, Mr. Trump, who took a swipe last year at Senator John McCain of Arizona for being \u201ccaptured\u201d in Vietnam, and long before that complained that \u201chomeless veterans\u201d were ruining his property values, made the night air sparkle with his praise. And soon, like a true ringmaster, he gave the people what they wanted \u2014 three real, live veterans who came onstage to speak to the crowd.As someone who spent 20 years in the active-duty Army, I should be used to strangers bending and twisting my service to suit their needs. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve been out of uniform for nearly a decade, and I still break out in a rash when I see service members used, misused and abused for commercial or political gain.For candidates, veterans are the most useful props imaginable. They are real-life stand-ins for any number of campaign trail virtues: patriotism, national defense, antielitism, take your pick. And they are a great way to inoculate oneself from criticism for not having served \u2014 which is the case for every major candidate in the 2016 race, not just Mr. Trump. (The former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, a long shot, is the exception.) Still, for Mr. Trump, who avoided military service in Vietnam, this was a particularly blatant and distasteful ploy for credibility.But the public gets something out of the bargain, too. For many, to be in a room with a veteran is to touch the battlefield. In his novel, \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk,\u201d Ben Fountain describes the quasi-religious ecstasy that can come about when civilians meet so-called war heroes: \u201cThey tremble. They breathe in fitful, stinky huffs. Their eyes skitz and quiver with the force of the moment, because here, finally, up close and personal, is the war made flesh.\u201d Mr. Trump hoped his supporters would skitz and quiver their way right into his campaign coffers.Other veterans saw last week\u2019s rally as just more of the same. Nathan Webster, a Desert Storm veteran and contributor to the anthology \u201cIncoming: Veteran Writers on Coming Home,\u201d told me that \u201cveterans are the go-to for any politician who wants an easy, effort-free splash for an event or promotion.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Iowa event appeared to be heavily seeded with fist-pumping veterans chanting \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d \u201cVeterans are like anybody else in this current culture,\u201d Mr. Webster said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to play along with whatever cynical fame-grab somebody offers them.\u201dMost veterans I know don\u2019t want to be lionized for any purpose. We were simply dedicated to doing our jobs to the best of our abilities, carrying out the orders of our superiors and coming home safe every night, not unlike responsible employees at Microsoft, City Hall or Mo\u2019s Coffee Shop. But politicians don\u2019t rally in honor of programmers, office clerks or short-order cooks because they just aren\u2019t as sexy and camera-ready as soldiers \u2014 particularly the ones who\u2019ve been battered and broken by combat. Military service is charged with a special aura of bravery and honor that politicians can\u2019t resist glomming on to.What a shame, then, that those who make it home alive sometimes find themselves fighting a new battle: to be seen as more than a prop on the American political stage.David Abrams, the author of the novel \u201cFobbit,\u201d served 20 years in the Army and lives in Butte, Mont.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Increasingly Muffled Press", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Chinese media have never had much freedom to pursue muckraking stories, or even to dutifully report the facts. Now, President Xi Jinping is going to extraordinary lengths to rein the press in even further.Mr. Xi recently visited the three main newsrooms in the country to convey in unmistakable terms that journalists are expected to behave like apparatchiks. That message, which predictably received fawning coverage, came a few days after the government announced it would further restrict foreign media, too.Under rules Beijing says it will start enforcing next month, foreign companies will be barred from publishing online content \u2014 including text, videos, maps and games \u2014 in China without prior approval from the government. The regulations, which could affect major American companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, are intended to \u201cpromote core socialist values.\u201dThose stifling steps will add to the information barriers Chinese people already face. Major sites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, which hundreds of millions of people around the globe use, are already blocked in China. The Chinese government began blocking access to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times in 2012, in retaliation for an article that exposed the hidden wealth of relatives of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister.Mr. Xi may feel pressure to restrict the worldview of his citizens at a time when the Chinese economy is under strain. An article on Monday in the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, China Daily, said news organizations were \u201cessential to political stability.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary for the media to restore people\u2019s trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged,\u201d the article said.It is during trying times, of course, that societies benefit most from a press that is free to scrutinize questionable policies and expose ineffective leaders.Mr. Xi\u2019s new guidance is likely to make the official press even more docile than it traditionally has been. But the approach will be self-defeating for the government in the long run. In an increasingly interconnected world, it is harder to control the flow of information across borders and within countries. New mechanisms of Internet censorship are typically met with creative tools to bypass them. And each new effort to keep Chinese people ignorant about their government and the outside world will make them only more determined to learn.Advertisement"}

Travis W. Thomas, an intellectual-property lawyer at Baker Botts, said it was conceivable that a court could eventually block the distribution of the movies, but added that it was a \u201clong shot\u201d for Rearden.It is now commonplace for movie and game makers to animate characters through motion capture, which typically involves placing markers all over the bodies of actors so cameras and software can record their movements. Nearly a decade ago, Mr. Perlman introduced Mova, which was designed to more faithfully capture the subtleties of facial expressions.The strange story of how Mova\u2019s ownership came to be contested resembles the twists and turns of a movie plot.Mr. Perlman founded and controlled the online game start-up OnLive, which he merged with Mova. But as the start-up struggled, he left in 2012. According to the countersuit against Shenzhenshi that Rearden filed this month, OnLive decided to sell Mova\u2019s assets later that year, and Mr. Perlman decided to acquire them from OnLive\u2019s controlling investor.He tasked a Rearden employee who worked on Mova motion capture projects, Greg LaSalle, with managing the process. But Mr. LaSalle negotiated to sell Mova\u2019s assets improperly to Digital Domain, Mr. Perlman said in the suit, which was filed in United States District Court in San Francisco.Shenzhenshi said in its lawsuit last year that it, in fact, acquired Mova in May 2013 and that it bought the technology legitimately from Mr. LaSalle for an undisclosed amount. The Chinese company said Mr. Perlman had previously been unable to make a successful business out of Mova and that he encouraged Mr. LaSalle to try to salvage it on his own.Mr. Perlman\u2019s later desire to regain control of Mova stemmed from \u201ca severe bout of \u2018seller\u2019s remorse\u2019 \u201d after widespread publicity about the Academy Award related to the technology, Shenzhenshi said in its suit. Shenzhenshi is \u201cclosely related\u201d to Digital Domain and its Hong Kong-based parent company, Digital Domain Holdings, Rearden said in its countersuit.Lawyers for Shenzhenshi did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Alex V. Chachkes, an intellectual-property lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, said he saw little chance that Rearden could prevent big movies that were created using Mova from being distributed, in part because courts tend to shy away from blocking the release of movies out of concerns about the First Amendment. It is more likely that Rearden could disrupt movie projects that Digital Domain is working on if a court ultimately sides with it, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s roughly zero chance they could do anything to slow down the \u2018Deadpool\u2019 juggernaut,\u201d Mr. Chachkes said.Advertisement"}

He said he was Jeremiah Asimov-Beckingham, a veteran of Afghanistan, wounded in combat, now working as an executive for an airline. He had come to the station to pick up his car.His new BMW had been impounded, he believed, as evidence in a random crime. But it was a ploy. The police were hoping to lure a man suspected of forging checks in Cambridge, Mass., to steal $70,000 and the BMW, which they had tracked to a Manhattan garage. They put Mr. Asimov-Beckingham in handcuffs and charged him with larceny.Still, his identity was a puzzle. He had spent 25 years stealing Social Security numbers and fabricating new aliases, leaving behind a thicket of confusing and falsified records. Six weeks earlier, he had been released from a federal prison in New Hampshire, where he had served six years for identity theft as Jeremy Clark-Erskine. But he had more than 27 aliases in five states. His birth certificate had been altered several times. Even his citizenship was in doubt. He had been deported more than once as an illegal immigrant. Now he is at Rikers Island, awaiting trial.\u201cThere is so much misinformation about me, no one can say with absolute certainty who I am,\u201d he said in an interview there late last month.Whatever his parentage, investigators say Mr. Wilson is a professional impostor and a skilled forger. Though fraud has become an increasingly invisible offense in a digital world, Mr. Wilson has stuck with a decidedly old-fashioned approach, stealing checks and creating new personas, occasionally with accents and falsified papers, the police said.He has portrayed himself as a Scottish-born D.J., a Cambridge-trained thespian, a Special Forces officer and a professor at M.I.T. He has posed as executives from Microsoft, British Airways and Apple, always with a military background. He pretended to be a soldier seeking asylum in Canada to escape anti-Semitic attacks in the United States. He once maintained an Irish accent so well and for so long that his cellmate in an Indiana jail was convinced that he was an Irish mobster.\u201cYou have to give him some grudging respect,\u201d said Brian A. Clark, his cousin and also a victim, having had his identity stolen by Mr. Wilson in the early 1990s. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper villain. He\u2019s just got flair.\u201dHe fits the profile of scammers who derive as much pleasure from hoodwinking others as they do from reaping a profit, said Louis B. Schlesinger, a professor of forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The elaborate fictions these swindlers spin tend to inflate their own egos. \u201cIt\u2019s always grandiose,\u201d Professor Schlesinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s always extraordinary.\u201dCriminals like Mr. Wilson also tend to lack empathy for their victims, experts said. \u201cThat\u2019s their watch; it just happens to be on the other person\u2019s wrist,\u201d Mr. Schlesinger said. \u201cThey see the world very differently than you do.\u201dHis most embittered victims say he has a gift for lulling people into trusting him, even when their instincts tell them something is not right. His lies are detailed, and he backs them up with forged documents, checks, letters, passports, court orders.Miryam Weisberg recalled how Mr. Wilson had convinced her that he was a former soldier from Boston who had done tours of duty in Afghanistan. He told vivid stories of barracks high jinks, camp life and combat, she said. \u201cHe gave more detail than anybody that I\u2019d ever known in the military,\u201d Ms. Weisberg said. She dated Mr. Wilson briefly in early 2006, just after he escaped from an Indiana prison. The romance ended when he stole her car and credit cards and fled to Canada.A few months later, he was jailed in Edmonton, Alberta, after being caught stealing passports at a youth hostel. He contacted Larry Derkach, the director of Jewish Family Services in Edmonton, and claimed to be a Jewish soldier who had suffered violent anti-Semitic attacks in the United States Army.\u201cThe story, in some ways, was kind of far-fetched, but he has the gift of gab,\u201d said Mr. Derkach, who added, \u201cThere were loads and loads of details that painted the story of a credible person in an unusual situation.\u201dMr. Derkach was so taken in that he let the G.I. stay at his home, something he has rarely done. In about three weeks, Mr. Wilson managed to have new credit cards issued to him on Mr. Derkach\u2019s account. Then he skipped town and ran up more than $17,000 worth of charges.Almost a decade later, Mr. Derkach said he was still amazed by Mr. Wilson\u2019s raw intelligence. As they worked on his case for refugee status, he recalled, Mr. Wilson quickly memorized a complex legal document and could quote sizable chunks of it verbatim. \u201cI think he has genius capability,\u201d Mr. Derkach said.His life of duplicity started early. His family in Indiana said he pulled his first con job while still at a Jesuit high school in Indianapolis, coming to class in a wheelchair to gain sympathy, then stealing from other students. He was expelled and lost a scholarship.He grew up in a home where money was tight and father figures inconstant, family members said. His father, Lonnie Wilson, and his mother, Patricia Clark, split up when he was a toddler. His mother remarried, to John Erskine, a hotel manager, but it was a rocky union, and they separated more than once.Not long after Mr. Wilson graduated from high school, his grandfather took him in and tried to mentor him because he kept running afoul of the law, having been arrested for stealing a crossbow and a car. He absconded with the older man\u2019s car and credit cards, wrecking the automobile in Colorado. \u201cHe became persona non grata with the family after that,\u201d an uncle, Dr. Charles Clark, said.It turned out that Mr. Wilson had taken more than the car. He also filched his cousin Brian Clark\u2019s Social Security number and assumed his identity, procuring drivers licenses and credit cards, even cashing a $2,000 check.\u201cHe is a con man and he knows what people don\u2019t ask questions about,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cHe is one of the smartest people I ever met.\u201dGiven the number of times Mr. Wilson has been caught, it is hard to call his career a success. In the mid-1990s, he served prison sentences in Ohio and Pennsylvania for forgery and theft. Immigration authorities detained him for several months in 1999 and 2000 after he tried to enter Washington State from British Columbia and two forged passports \u2014 one Irish and one Canadian \u2014 were discovered in his car.Then in 2001, he was sentenced to eight years in prison in Indiana after he was caught running up $7,400 in charges at strip clubs and hotels on credit cards he had obtained under a fictional identity. He had been posing as Duncan C. MacDonald, a Microsoft executive, court papers said.In March 2006, he escaped from a work-release program in Indiana and fled to Canada, only to be recaptured in May 2007 as he tried to slip back into the United States to see his dying mother, family members said.He was briefly released a year later but was rearrested in August 2008 after he checked into a luxury hotel in Indianapolis, court documents show. He had charged the room to an Eli Lilly corporate account; he had persuaded the company\u2019s accounting department over the telephone to give it to him.Returned to jail in Indianapolis, Mr. Wilson spent his days doing push-ups on his knuckles and reading widely, devouring crime novels and newspapers. His cellmate at the time, Uriah Goins, recalled he was particularly interested in obituaries and death notices, which he would carefully tear out and stow away. He told Mr. Goins that he was \u201clooking for relatives.\u201dEven in jail, Mr. Wilson played a character, Mr. Goins said. He talked ceaselessly in an Irish accent, regaling Mr. Goins with stories of serving in the Irish military. \u201cHe\u2019s like an actor,\u201d Mr. Goins said, pausing. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely an actor.\u201dMr. Goins, a D.J. and promoter, said there was something vulnerable about Mr. Wilson. When Mr. Wilson was released, it was Mr. Goins who picked him up and helped him find a place to stay. A friend, Michael Lafferty, had an extra room and Mr. Goins introduced them.Mr. Lafferty said Mr. Wilson portrayed himself as a well-educated man, schooled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who had fallen on hard times and had a young child dying of cancer who wanted to see the Great Wall of China.Three weeks later, Mr. Lafferty reported to the police that Mr. Wilson had run off with his credit card numbers, his Social Security number and an original birth certificate. Mr. Wilson fled to Chicago with a 19-year-old woman named Angela K. Stamm, whom he had met online through OK Cupid.She said she believed Mr. Wilson\u2019s story that he was a recently discharged British soldier named Finn Keenan who was facing deportation. They stayed in Chicago for a month, where he tended bar, she said. Then he told her the government had \u201cfound him.\u201d They drove west to Missoula, Mont., where he started calling himself Angus Jocko Ferguson.They found a place to stay with Reid Reimers, a theater teacher. He bonded with Mr. Reimers and his friends over a shared love of theater. He claimed that he had studied at Cambridge in England, and he was well-versed in Shakespeare. Soon, Mr. Reimers recalled, he was serving as M.C. at events and joining in rehearsal.\u201cHe was \u2014 again, not surprisingly now \u2014 quite a good performer,\u201d Mr. Reimers recalled. \u201cThe most disarming thing about him \u2014 he was kind of a nerd. He had this silly laugh. It wasn\u2019t that he was charming or suave.\u201dHe would disappear for days at a time, returning with duffel bags full of military gear and hinting about missions with a secretive commando force, said Mr. Reimers and Ms. Stamm, who now uses the surname Venado. But he was actually busy forging a new identity, investigators said. He had obtained a driver\u2019s license with his new alias, having switched Mr. Lafferty\u2019s Social Security number to Angus Ferguson with a forged court order in Chicago.Mr. Wilson also visited Fort Harrison, a Montana National Guard training site, in late August and tried to get a military ID card and body armor, telling officers there that he was a captain in the Special Forces on a secret mission, investigators said. One officer who spoke to him became suspicious and called the F.B.I., which put out an alert.Not long after that, he was arrested as he tried to enter Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls with Ms. Venado. An alert guard discovered that the car was stolen. When F.B.I. agents interviewed him at the Cascade County jail in Great Falls, Mr. Wilson stayed in character. \u201cHe goes through the whole spiel about how he\u2019s in the Fifth Special Forces Group,\u201d Special Agent Ernesto L. Negron said.Agent Negron noticed, however, that Mr. Wilson\u2019s patches were in the wrong places, and he could not recall his commander\u2019s name. Before the agent could check his fingerprints against a national database, he persuaded Mr. Reimers to post his bail and give him a ride back to Missoula. He packed his bags and left immediately, just an hour before agents knocked on the door, Ms. Venado said.\u201cHe kind of came clean, and said, \u2018I\u2019m not in the Army Reserves and I need to leave,\u2019\u201d Ms. Venado recalled. \u201cI was totally freaked out and didn\u2019t know what to do. He asked me to come with him, but I said no. I didn\u2019t trust him anymore.\u201dHe rented a second car \u2014 a Mustang convertible this time \u2014 and drove to Los Angeles, where he began posing as a Scottish D.J. and video producer with the unlikely name of Angus Jocko Ferguson-Abramovitch, according to court documents. He also pretended to be a veteran who worked for Apple, persuading a Beverly Hills dentist to do $28,000 worth of work. He was finally arrested in January 2010 because the Mustang was towed. A pound worker alerted the Culver City, Calif., police that it was on a list of stolen cars.In New York, Mr. Wilson is charged with forgery and possession of stolen property. He also faces charges in Cambridge, where the police say he set up a bank account under the name Jeremiah Asimov-Beckingham with a forged driver\u2019s license, Social Security card and military discharge papers, then deposited more than $70,000 worth of checks drawn on the account of a local design company. He had lifted one of the company\u2019s checks from a mailbox and printed checks with the same account number. He used the stolen funds to make the first payment on a leased BMW, then absconded to New York City.On a recent morning, Mr. Wilson walked into a chapel on Rikers Island, wearing a khaki prison uniform. His head was shaved and he wore a short red beard. He was fit and compact, and looked young for 42. His body was adorned with Celtic tattoos. On the back of his head was a dent, a scar he claimed had been caused by a rubber bullet. He greeted visitors with a disarming smile and spoke in an educated voice that dropped in and out of an Irish brogue.\u201cPeople have a tendency not just to believe people, but to want to believe people,\u201d he said when asked how he deceived his victims. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the wrong in the things that I have done, because I take that away from people.\u201dHe spoke candidly about his past crimes but would not comment on the new charges against him. He feels no remorse, he said, for ripping off credit card companies and banks, but he is sorry for fooling people who befriended him. Every friendship in his life was built on lies and half-truths, he said, and they all ended with him running away, often with his friends\u2019 personal information in his pocket.\u201cThat\u2019s the evil behind everything I have done,\u201d he said. \u201cI get involved with people who don\u2019t deserve the betrayal that\u2019s bound to come.\u201dMr. Wilson consented to the interview, he said, because he had spent his whole life trying to obscure his identity and now wanted to reveal who he really was. He said his father was not Lonnie Wilson, the men\u2019s store manager his mother married, but Mr. Keenan, the I.R.A. leader, with whom, he said, his mother had an affair in Northern Ireland in 1972.It is not an entirely new claim. He first tried to argue that Mr. Keenan was his father in 2011, when he filed a lawsuit in prison asking a federal judge to declare that he was not an American citizen. At the time he was seeking to be deported.The next year, he tried to convince his own sister, Mary Katharine Rybak. During prison visits, he showed her a notarized letter, supposedly written by their mother, to back up his claim of being Mr. Keenan\u2019s son. She noticed their mother\u2019s signature was not right. \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t know where the lies stop and the truth starts anymore,\u201d she said.Stephen Ure, an immigration lawyer in San Diego, said Mr. Wilson had hired him to help with his effort to be sent to Britain. In 2012, Mr. Ure said, he received DNA samples via courier that according to accompanying documents, had been taken years earlier from Mr. Keenan, Mr. Wilson and his mother. Mr. Ure had the samples tested at a California laboratory, and the results proved conclusively Mr. Keenan was Mr. Wilson\u2019s father, the lawyer said. \u201cIf his story is not true, he\u2019s done a lot of work to make it seem true,\u201d Mr. Ure said.But like everything in Mr. Wilson\u2019s world, there is doubt, this time about the origin of the samples. The documents claimed that a British company, DNA Worldwide Group Ltd., had collected the samples in 2006 and then handed them over to officials at the Royal Bank of Scotland for safekeeping.

{"Headline": "Vanguard, a Champion of Low Fees, Faces a Peculiar Tax Challenge", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesVanguard may have committed a sin while pursuing a virtue.Its virtue \u2014 providing simple, diversified investments at very low cost \u2014 is well known. Its sin \u2014 if that\u2019s what it deserves to be called \u2014 involves obscure details of tax accounting and corporate structure. It\u2019s not easy stuff.First, consider Vanguard\u2019s virtues. Since John C. Bogle founded it in 1975, Vanguard has relentlessly cut costs for fund shareholders, offering simple index funds and \u201cat cost\u201d operations that have been a boon to millions of people, in the view of many academics and investment analysts. It did this with the help of an unusual corporate structure, which is at the root of the whistle-blower\u2019s tax complaint.Mutual fund shareholders, not a separate profit-making entity, are the ultimate owners of the Vanguard Group, which provides services to the individual funds, an arrangement approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cVanguard was designed to eliminate conflicts of interest,\u201d said Tamar Frankel, a professor of law at Boston University. \u201cThat structure was also one of the ways in which Jack Bogle reduced the cost for investors, and it\u2019s been an absolutely great thing.\u201dThat\u2019s the easy part of this story. The harder part is the claim that while providing at-cost services, Vanguard may have run afoul of some I.R.S. rules. That is what David Danon, a former Vanguard tax lawyer, says in whistle-blower claims against Vanguard filed with the I.R.S. and other authorities. The I.R.S. won\u2019t comment on the claims, and John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, said, \u201cVanguard believes they are without merit.\u201dMr. Danon and Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, a University of Michigan law professor who has served as Mr. Danon\u2019s paid expert, have some intriguing arguments, if you are partial to this sort of thing. The issue is technical, so bear with me: Mr. Danon says that because the Vanguard Group was set up as a \u201cC corporation,\u201d and not a partnership, it has potential tax liabilities, even if it does not actually earn a profit. And because it is owned by its mutual funds, for tax purposes, he says, it is required to account for the profits that it could have earned if it had charged the higher fees that the marketplace would have borne.This may sound like a through-the-looking-glass sort of world, where a company will be punished if it spares investors exorbitant fees, but it could conceivably be the world in which we actually live.\u201cThis is a classic transfer-pricing issue,\u201d Professor Avi-Yonah says. \u201cThe law is very clear.\u201dOn technical grounds, the I.R.S. \u201ccould surely win in court\u201d if it applied transfer-pricing rules in the Vanguard case, Professor Avi-Yonah said.Not everyone is sure of that, though. David M. Schizer, a professor and dean emeritus at Columbia Law School, put the matter succinctly. \u201cThe transfer-pricing rules are intended to capture economic reality and not distort it,\u201d he said, adding that they weren\u2019t intended to apply in a situation like this and result in taxes when no profit existed. \u201cI think it would be absurd to force Vanguard to pay taxes in this case,\u201d he said. And John D. Morley, a Yale law professor who is an expert on mutual fund structure, said, \u201cI consider this litigation a little silly.\u201dTransfer-pricing rules are meant for situations in which a company controls a subsidiary and can use that control to set artificially low prices, thus concealing profits. That\u2019s not true here, Professor Morley said. \u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d he said, \u201call mutual funds are completely dominated by their manager. While Vanguard shareholders ultimately own the Vanguard Group, they don\u2019t really control it,\u201d he said. Vanguard charges low fees \u201csimply because that\u2019s the culture of Vanguard, as Jack Bogle created it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unique situation.\u201dEven Professor Avi-Yonah acknowledged in an interview that applying transfer-pricing rules in the case of Vanguard \u201cseems startling.\u201d In fact, he said he wasn\u2019t sure that the I.R.S. should enforce the rules in this fashion. \u201cLuckily, I don\u2019t have to make this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cGod knows the I.R.S. has enormous discretion in these cases.\u201d The agency \u201ccould accept the taxpayer\u2019s argument that it was an innocent mistake,\u201d he continued, even if \u201cit involves an enormous amount of tax revenue.\u201dMr. Danon asserts that Vanguard could owe billions of dollars in taxes on the putative, uncollected revenue. \u201cI know that this is a very unpopular position, and that many, many people are shareholders of Vanguard funds,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut the law is the law. Like everybody else, Vanguard should pay the taxes it owes. If it doesn\u2019t, somebody else has to make up the difference, and that\u2019s just not fair.\u201dOthers have looked closely at the possible amounts involved. I\u2019ll return to the numbers shortly. But first, some conflict-of-interest disclosures: Professor Avi-Yonah has an obvious conflict. He says he received $10,000 to $50,000 from Mr. Danon for his research and legal opinion. But he also says that the money has not influenced his views and notes that he will collect nothing further if Mr. Danon\u2019s position prevails.Mr. Danon has a conflict: Now unemployed, he could receive a whistle-blower\u2019s bonus of up to 30 percent of any funds collected by the I.R.S. in the claim. But he says he is fighting for a principle: \u201cI felt I had to become a whistle-blower because I believe I\u2019m right, and the law is the law, and I couldn\u2019t convince anyone at Vanguard about it.\u201dI have a conflict, too. Vanguard manages the retirement account at my workplace, as it does in many companies and institutions, and so I am a Vanguard shareholder. That\u2019s also true of several experts I contacted.Federal and state authorities have been considering these arguments. While the I.R.S. claim is pending, a New York judge dismissed Mr. Danon\u2019s suit in November, and Eric Soufer, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said on Wednesday that his office reviewed the case and has decided not to pursue it. Authorities in California declined to comment on a complaint filed by Mr. Danon there. He also has a claim with the S.E.C., which declined to comment.Mr. Danon has won one battle, however. The Texas comptroller of public accounts awarded him $117,000 for his role as a whistle-blower, said Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the agency. Reliable sources said Vanguard settled with the state for roughly $2 million, though the precise reasons for the settlement are not clear. Mr. Woerth of Vanguard wouldn\u2019t confirm the amount of the payment, and said it was merely the \u201cresult of a routine audit.\u201d It is possible that it arose from a relatively small part of Mr. Danon\u2019s complaint \u2014 questions he has raised about the accounting for a $1.5 billion contingency fund that Vanguard maintains.Even if the I.R.S. finds Vanguard liable on all counts, the consequences are unlikely to be significant, says Daniel Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago (who, like me, is a Vanguard shareholder). He says that, with penalties, a Vanguard settlement with federal and state authorities could raise average annual mutual fund shareholder fees by no more than 0.09 percentage point, and probably less. Professor Avi-Yonah said he has reviewed Professor Hemel\u2019s calculations: \u201cI would rely on them.\u201dEven with such an extreme outcome \u2014 which seems highly unlikely \u2014 Vanguard would remain the cheapest overall fund provider by a wide margin.In short, Vanguard is far from perfect. Mr. Danon appears to have some valid points and may win some further bonuses. And at the end of all this, shareholders would benefit if Vanguard ended up as an even more transparent company than it is right now. How much do top Vanguard executives earn, for example? If we shareholders really own Vanguard, it seems that we should know.I asked that question again last week and Mr. Woerth wouldn\u2019t say.But even without knowing the answer to that question or others raised by Mr. Danon, there seems to be no compelling reason for Vanguard shareholders to switch their investments to another company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Society Pays When Women\u2019s Work Is Unpaid", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byGender GapIn countries around the world, the ways in which men and women spend their time are unbalanced. Men spend more time working for money. Women do the bulk of the unpaid work \u2014 cooking, cleaning and child care.This unpaid work is essential for households and societies to function. But it is also valued less than paid work, and when it is women\u2019s responsibility, it prevents them from doing other things.Over all, richer countries like the United States tend to have a smaller time gap for unpaid work than poorer countries like Mexico. Japan, which has one of the largest gaps, has recently started a host of initiatives to try to increase the number of women who work for pay instead of doing full-time child care, because leaders said it was essential to economic growth.Relative to women, men spend the most time doing chores in the Scandinavian countries, and the least time in India, Mexico, Turkey and Japan. In Norway, for instance, women spend just over 3.5 hours a day on unpaid work and men spend three hours. In India, women spend six hours and men spend less than an hour. When not making a comparison with women, South Korean men come out last at 0.7 hours.When the time women spend on unpaid work shrinks to three hours a day from five hours, their labor force participation increases 20 percent, according to the O.E.C.D. When women are not able to go to school, their children are less healthy and more likely to stay in poverty. Women could do more paid work and get more education if men did more unpaid work, or if both did fewer chores.\u201cWe need to call work what it is \u2014 work \u2014 whether you do it at home or whether you do it out in the labor force, and then give men and women options to choose what they want to do,\u201d Ms. Gates said.Technology plays a key role in reducing the time chores take: Think about the time American women spent washing clothes and cooking before the invention of modern appliances.Ms. Gates said the foundation planned to increase its support for ways to reduce the gap in unpaid work, such as providing contraceptives and cellphones for women, which could help women in developing countries. Cellphones allow women to more quickly access information like a clinic\u2019s vaccine supply or the price of a crop at the market.Cultural change is also important, Ms. Gates said.She recalled being unhappy about the long commute to her oldest daughter\u2019s preschool. Mr. Gates, then chief executive of Microsoft, said he would drive their daughter two days a week.\u201cMoms started going home and saying to their husbands, \u2018If Bill Gates can drive his daughter, you better darn well drive our daughter or son,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Gates said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get behavior change, you have to role-model it publicly.\u201dAn Upshot article on Feb. 23 about the effect of women\u2019s unpaid work on economies around the world misstated the percentage increase in women\u2019s labor participation when the time they spend on unpaid work shrinks to three hours a day from five hours.

{"Headline": "Palau vs. the Poachers", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "FeatureThe island nation has mounted an aggressive response to illegal fishing in their waters. How they protect themselves may help the rest of the world save all of the oceans.Supported byCaught fishing in a marine sanctuary, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 was fleeing to Indonesian waters, beyond Palau\u2019s jurisdiction. Once across the boundary, the crew could easily unload its catch at a local wharf and disappear among the thousands of small Filipino or Indonesian islands of the western Pacific. Determined not to let that happen, the Remeliik\u2019s skipper, running on Bergman\u2019s coordinates, was pushing 15 knots \u2014 a pace that worried its engineer. But the police were desperate to keep up. In the previous six months, they had spotted but failed to capture nearly a dozen other pirate fishing ships. If the Remeliik\u2019s officers miscalculated their heading by even a small fraction of a degree, they would miss their target.Bergman had been tracking the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 for weeks, and emailed an alert about possible illegal fishing two days earlier. Before moving to West Virginia to work for SkyTruth, he spent three years working as a marine ob\u00adserver on Alaskan fishing boats, logging the details of the daily catch, as required by federal and state fishery authorities. At SkyTruth, Bergman did his surveillance work from a far greater remove, monitoring ships by satellite. For months, he had been studying a satellite feed from above Palau. He knew its squiggles and slashes by memory. A passenger boat out of Pitcairn Island appeared every few weeks; a United States Navy ship from Diego Garcia conducted regular maneuvers; a Chinese research vessel was doing a survey of some sort in a grid pattern; a Taiwanese ship that never seemed to fish made repeated trips out to meet other long-line fishing vessels. The Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 stood out, however. Switching among registries of fishing permits, regional tuna licenses and blacklisted vessels, he could tell it had no license to fish in Palau\u2019s waters, even though its zigzag trajectory indicated it was doing just that.In response to Bergman\u2019s alert, an international team gathered into the cramped, second-floor police command center on Koror, Palau\u2019s most populous island. There were three local police officers, an adviser from the Pew Charitable Trusts and two Australian Navy officers, on loan to Palau to advise on everything from running the Remeliik (which the Australians had also donated) to using satellite-data analysis software. Working through the night and the following day, the team radioed the information they received from West Virginia to Allison Baiei, a Palauan marine police officer, aboard the Remeliik.Police efforts like these, coordinated and international in scope, are a rarity when it comes to enforcing the law at sea, but the alternative is usually no enforcement at all. More than two-thirds of the planet is covered by water, and much of that liquid expanse is ungoverned and potentially ungovernable. Criminal enterprise has flourished in the breach. The global black market for seafood is worth more than $20 billion, and approximately one in every five fish consumed globally is caught illegally.After a 51-hour push, much of it through heavy seas, the Remeliik\u2019s unrelenting pace finally paid off: It caught up with the Taiwanese ship just a few miles before the boundary with Indonesian waters. The officers escorted the ship back to port in Palau, and when they inspected the hold, Baiei told me, they found an especially grim haul. Inside, among the stacks of tuna, were hundreds of severed shark fins. The officers piled the contraband onto the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33\u2019s deck and, when they ran out of room there, piled the rest into a bloody heap on the dock. They counted, measured and photographed the fins to use for the eventual prosecution, then dumped them into the sea. \u2018\u2018Disgusting,\u2019\u2019 was all Baiei would say about the scene.In the face of this challenge, Palau has mounted an aggressive response. In 2006, it was among the first nations to ban bottom trawling \u2014 a practice not unlike strip mining in which fishing boats drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor to catch the fish in the waters just above, killing virtually everything else in their path. In 2009, it prohibited commercial shark fishing in its waters, creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary. In 2015, it announced plans to require observers aboard all its tuna longliners. (Elsewhere in the region, observers are aboard just one in 50 tuna longliners.) Palau has also teamed up with Greenpeace, which helped patrol its territorial waters, and it started a campaign on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, raising more than $50,000 to support its conservation work. Palau\u2019s most radical move, though, was creating a \u2018\u2018no take\u2019\u2019 reserve in 2015. Within this zone, which encompasses 193,000 square miles, all export fishing (along with any drilling or mining) will be strictly prohibited.From one perspective, Palau\u2019s work suggests a hopeful future. It offers a model for successful ad hoc collaboration among countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations. Palau has also emerged as a testing ground for some of the technology \u2014 including drones, satellite monitoring and military-grade radar \u2014 that might finally empower countries to spot and arrest the pirates, poachers, polluters, traffickers and other scofflaws who prowl the seas with impunity.But Palau\u2019s conservation efforts are really motivated by a more immediate sense of self-preservation. In September, I sat down with Palau\u2019s president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., in his cluttered, wood-paneled office in Koror. A sturdy man with an intense stare, Remengesau explained to me that more than half of Palau\u2019s gross domestic product comes from tourism, mostly people visiting to dive on Palau\u2019s reefs, which house more fish, coral and other invertebrates per square mile than virtually anywhere else on Earth. Remengesau boiled the problem down to simple economics, noting that sharks were an especially big draw for undersea sightseers. Alive, an individual shark is worth more than $170,000 annually in tourism dollars, he said, or nearly $2 million over its lifetime. Dead, each can go for a hundred dollars \u2014 and usually, he added, that money winds up in the pockets of a foreign poacher.The poachers calculate differently, of course. More than a dozen countries, including Palau and Taiwan, have banned shark-finning. But demand for the fins, especially in Asia, remains high. Shark-fin soup, which can cost more than $100 a bowl, has for centuries signified wealth and status, and it became especially popular in the late 1980s as a status item for China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle and upper classes. Ship captains often allow their crew members to supplement their income by keeping the fins for themselves to sell at port. Shark carcasses take up valuable hold space in smaller ships, and as they decompose, they produce ammonia that contaminates the other catch. Deckhands usually cut off the fins, which can sell for 100 times the cost of the rest of the meat. They then throw the rest of the shark back into the water. It\u2019s a slow death: The sharks sink to the sea floor, where they starve, drown or are eaten by other fish.In a given year, Palau faces 50 to 100 incursions by pirate vessels. Fish ignore borders \u2014 and, it turns out, so do many of the people pursuing them. While port inspections, wheel-room cameras, locational transponders and onboard observers are essential to better monitoring the oceans, policing is the only thing that will make Palau\u2019s new reserve, and others like it elsewhere in the world, more than just lines drawn on the water.The oceans belong to everyone and no one, and the general perception is that they are too big to need protection. We also tend to think of fish as an ever-regenerating crop, there forever for our taking. But roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s ocean stocks are depleted or overexploited; one study predicts that by 2050, the sea could contain more plastic waste than fish. Though most governments have neither the inclination nor the resources to patrol the oceans, Palau is trying a different approach, and whether it succeeds or fails may have consequences for the entire planet.The plan was to patrol the waters near Kayangel, an atoll in the country\u2019s far north, an area popular for sea-cucumber and coral-fish poachers. A tiny, rugged fleck of land, roughly half a square mile, Kayangel has perhaps 60 year-round residents; there is no airstrip, and power and cell service are erratic. Local fishermen had spotted poachers near the atoll, and our patrol was meant to show a police presence in the area.For any given patrol, the chief of the marine police weighs a list of variables \u2014 credible threat, distance to target, available crew, sufficient fuel, weather \u2014 and decides if it\u2019s worth dispatching the Remeliik. Today, we would head out instead on one of the department\u2019s two much smaller fiberglass boats, which they use in shallow waters closer to shore. When we pulled out of port, the sea was glass-flat, but as the land behind us fell beneath the horizon, we began rolling in 10-foot swells \u2014 it was clear why this smaller boat was ill-suited to chasing poachers into deeper water.Baiei said the turning point for Palau, the moment when the nation realized that it needed help, was March 29, 2012. The other officers shook their heads at the mere mention of the date. The agonizing story began earlier that month, when two Chinese poacher boats were spotted near the atoll for several days in a row. They kept escaping: Each was equipped with three 60-horsepower outboard motors, while the local wildlife rangers had only a Zodiac with one outboard motor.Around 7 a.m. on March 29, the Palauan rangers saw one of the Chinese boats again. This time they got close enough to try to shoot out its engines, Baiei said. They hit an engine, but they also hit a Chinese deckhand, Lu Yong. (Palauan rangers say they were not aiming for him; the bullets ricocheted off the engines.) The rangers called for help to rush Lu, 35, to a nearby island where a nurse lived, but he bled to death before they got there. He had a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter in mainland China. But the day would only get more tragic from there.Boarding the Chinese boat and interrogating the rest of the crew, the Palauan rangers soon learned that there was a larger \u2018\u2018mother ship\u2019\u2019 farther at sea, orchestrating the poaching raids. This was too far for the small Zodiac to travel, so two Palauan policemen, Willie Mays Towai and Earlee Decherong, along with an American pilot, Frank Ohlinger, were dispatched in a rented single-engine Cessna to find the ship and call in its coordinates.As night fell, the pilot got lost, and the plane vanished. Meanwhile, about 35 miles from shore, another team, aboard the Remeliik, finally discovered the 80-foot mother ship, which immediately bolted, ignoring several warning shots fired across its bow. After several hours of running, though, the mother ship drifted to a halt. It was soon engulfed in flames, most likely from an intentional fire set to hide any evidence of poaching. The pirate crew scrambled into a lifeboat just before the ship sank, and they were arrested shortly thereafter.The Cessna pilot and the two policemen were still lost, wandering somewhere above the Pacific. The authorities on land came up with an idea: If they could illuminate the islands brightly enough, the pilot might see them and find his way back home. The public safety director ordered all emergency vehicles to drive to the highest points in Koror and turn on their flashing lights. \u2018\u2018Aim spotlights upward,\u2019\u2019 yachters were instructed. The stadium lights at Palau\u2019s Asahi baseball field were switched on. Residents were asked to turn on all household lights. Some stood in the streets waving flashlights. Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, who happened to be vacationing in Palau, provided the two helicopters on his 414-foot mega-yacht, the Octopus, for search and rescue. Allen\u2019s crew was instructed to fire 49 flares, one per minute, into the air. An official in Angaur, an island on the nation\u2019s southern tip, suggested setting some of the outer-atoll wooded areas on fire \u2014 a plan that was quickly dismissed.Back at the command center on Koror, several police officers were trying in vain to contact the plane. Its radio was malfunctioning. They could hear Ohlinger, but he could not hear them. For nearly five hours, culminating in a mayday call at 8:16 p.m., they listened to his growing panic, his rage at the plane\u2019s broken GPS unit and compass and, ultimately, his request that someone alert his next of kin. \u2018\u2018On a good glide slope, heading north,\u2019\u2019 Ohlinger said, as he explained that he and his two passengers planned to crash-land into the sea. \u2018\u2018We are at 6,000 feet, doing 65 knots, out of fuel,\u2019\u2019 were his last words. The wreckage was never found.The major innovation, the one that in the 1930s helped transform fishing from hunting to something more akin to industrial mining, was the giant-scale purse seiner \u2014 a ship that surrounds an entire school of fish with a curtain of netting, sometimes nearly a mile around, then cinches it like a laundry bag. But more innovations followed. World War II gave incentive to the creation of lighter, faster, more durable ships that could travel farther on less fuel. Submarine combat drove improvements in sonar, which turned the ocean top into a glass table, making visible the unseen fathoms below. Subzero onboard freezers freed fishermen from their race against melting refrigerator ice. Innovations in plastics and monofilaments lengthened fishing lines from feet to miles. Lightweight polymer-based nets enabled supertrawlers to rake the ocean even more brutally.But, as the Palauans and their allies are discovering, technology can also be deployed for conservation. Just as authorities can use tracking devices and satellite data to monitor the activities of people on land, they are increasingly able to do so at sea. Since the 1990s, ships have deployed the Automatic Identification System, or A.I.S., a once-voluntary collision-avoidance system whereby onboard VHF transmitters convey their position, identity and speed continuously to other ships and to satellites. In 2002, the United Nations\u2019 maritime organization mandated A.I.S. for nearly all passenger ships regardless of size, and commercial ships, fishing vessels included, with a gross tonnage of more than 300 (typically, that\u2019s a 130-foot long vessel) in international waters.A.I.S. has its shortcomings. Captains are allowed to turn the transponders off when they perceive a credible danger of being tracked by pirates \u2014 a gaping loophole for poachers. The system can be hacked to give false locations. Many of the ships involved in the worst crimes, like the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, are smaller than 300 tonnes and thus exempt from the system entirely. Partly as a response to the deficiencies of A.I.S., many countries now also require fishing vessels to carry an additional device called a vessel-monitoring system, or V.M.S. Typically, this takes the form of a cone-shaped antenna on the roof of the wheelhouse, wired to a locked transceiver and the ship\u2019s control panel, that transmits their location and other data to local fishery authorities at all times.More sea-traffic data may become available soon as countries consider deploying devices in the water \u2014 sonar and camera buoys, as well as low-cost floating hydrophones \u2014 to catch ships approaching restricted areas. Even storm clouds, which long concealed many crimes at sea, no longer pose as much of an obstacle. Satellites armed with syn\u00adthetic-aperture radar can detect a vessel\u2019s position regardless of weather conditions. All this data becomes especially useful when coupled with sophisticated software whose algorithms can trigger alerts \u2014 if, for instance, a vessel goes \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 by turning off its transponder, if it zigzags in certain formations that indicate that it\u2019s fishing or if it enters a forbidden area. Now, instead of blindly patrolling broad swaths of ocean, the police can target their efforts.Still, the most reliable form of ocean law enforcement continues to be real-time direct surveillance, which is neither easy nor cheap. Generating close-in imagery from the sky depends predominantly on military-grade drones. Ordering up high-resolution photographs from space is still extremely costly, sometimes more than $3,500 per picture, and the company or government that operates the satellite often requires the request for the image to be made days in advance, so operators can aim the lens at the right location on its next trip hurtling around the Earth. Palau experimented with smaller, commercially available drones in 2013, in a project funded by an Australian mining magnate, Andrew Forrest. But the drones proved to be too expensive and hard to fly, and the cameras mounted on the drones gave too tightly circumscribed a view of the waters below.The eventual dream is to create systems that pull all the antipoaching intelligence together in real time, giving the police and their helpers a God\u2019s-eye view of their adversaries. In 2014, SkyTruth joined with Google and the nonprofit group Oceana to build Global Fishing Watch, a website that will allow an army of would-be Bjorn Bergmans to track A.I.S. data on roughly 80,000 vessels worldwide. Last year, Pew teamed up with a British company called Satellite Applications Catapult to create a virtual \u2018\u2018watch room\u2019\u2019 program that, drawing on live satellite tracking data, displays a map of the world traversed by lighted dots, each one a fishing vessel. Even as the vastness of the oceans makes it easy for poachers to escape, technology is also making it harder for them to hide.Many valuable fish species \u2014 including tuna, blue marlin and mahi-mahi \u2014 huddle near floating objects for protection and mating. FADs take advantage of this instinct, attracting fish in spectacularly dense schools that fishermen quickly scoop up. \u2018\u2018Drifting\u2019\u2019 FADs are unanchored: Fishermen track them by following the currents. \u2018\u2018Moored\u2019\u2019 FADs are tethered to the ocean floor, typically with concrete blocks. Increasingly, fishing companies are deploying \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 FADs equipped with sonar and GPS, enabling operators to sit back and wait for an alert when it\u2019s time to retrieve their haul.The global popularity of FADs is, at least in part, an unintended consequence of the movement to save dolphins. Commercial fishing fleets once found tuna by looking for dolphins, which follow tuna schools and swim near the surface above them. In the 1980s and 1990s, the push for \u2018\u2018dolphin free\u2019\u2019 tuna drove many of these fishermen from the Eastern Tropical Pacific, near Baja, to the Central and Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, where the dolphins typically don\u2019t follow tuna. In making this move, many of these ships turned to FADs as their new tactic \u2014 even though the devices are widely criticized for further industrializing the harvest of fast-disappearing species like sharks, sea turtles and tuna.On one patrol with Baiei, we stopped at a FAD so that I could dive in for a closer look. Bathwater-warm, the ocean was translucent turquoise, the current as strong as a river. The FAD was low-tech and anchored, just a plastic buoy attached to a thick, mollusk-coated rope tethered to the ocean floor more than 500 feet below. Large bamboo leaves ran down the first 50 feet of the rope, flapping like fuzzy moth wings. Hundreds of tiny silver fish darted under the shade of the leaves. Not one fish was more than a foot long.We visited three more FADs during the patrol that day, traversing more than 100 miles. All were barren. The fish, Baiei explained, were all being taken before they could even come to the reserve. Tuna, like many large ocean fish, are migratory. Even if their natural path might take them to the safety of Palau\u2019s asylum, they can be picked off beforehand in any number of ways \u2014 including by being netted at one of the more than 50,000 floating FADs in the Western and Central Pacific, most of which are perfectly legal.In recent years, a handful of countries have tried to slow the ocean plunder. They have limited trawling, put caps on FAD numbers and imposed rules to limit \u2018\u2018bycatch,\u2019\u2019 the unwanted species caught in the hunt for prized fish. Perhaps the most promising tactic has been to create more no-take reserves like Palau\u2019s. In 2014, the Obama administration added 400,000 square miles of similarly protected territory to United States waters. In 2015, the British government announced its intent to establish the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve (322,000 square miles) around the Pitcairn Islands. But these reserves work only if they are well policed. Otherwise, they become magnets for poachers who see them as robust and competition-free zones. And, as we saw at our own little FAD, even a well-policed reserve is not enough to protect the fish who freely swim outside their safe zones. Presently such reserves cover around 2 percent of the world\u2019s seas, but many oceanographers say we need to cover at least 10 percent to make a substantial difference.As the sun set, one marine officer said he wanted to check a final FAD near an islet called Orak, this time in hopes of landing a few fish for dinner. After dragging their longline in circles around it for an hour, they gave up, empty-handed. Docking instead at a nearby island, the officers bought some chicken stew from the local market.I wanted a better view, but as I started to climb onto an upper deck, one of the Indonesian crewmen lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. My hand was inches away from touching an electrified steel cable that the fishermen use to stun catch that flop wildly when first pulled on deck. The crewman pointed to a six-inch black burn mark on a shipmate\u2019s arm, warning me of what the cable could do.As the officers questioned the ship\u2019s captain, I wandered to the back of the ship. A ladder down a hatch led to a four-foot high tunnel, where crawling on hands and knees was the only option. Running the length of the vessel, the tunnel was lined with a dozen six-foot-long cubbies, each with wadded-up clothing at one end serving as pillows. The trip from Taiwan to these waters (about 1,400 miles) takes a little over a week. In high seas and heavy weather, staying on deck is out of the question. The farther I crawled, the darker and muggier it got and the heavier the flow of fumes, heat and noise. A rat scurried ahead. A rancid-smelling liquid dripped from above. The captain later told me that this was runoff from the upper-deck cutting tables.At the deepest end of the tunnel, I came to the ship\u2019s huge diesel engine, churning furiously. I sat in that tight space for a couple of minutes to take in the scene. It dawned on me that the passageway I had just descended was not just the men\u2019s sleeping quarters. It was also the engine\u2019s main exhaust pipe.Back on the Remeliik, I passed the time reading a confidential investigation report about the 2012 Cessna incident, which had been leaked to me by a Palauan official. It in\u00ad\u00adcluded transcripts of interviews with the 25 fishermen from the illegal Chinese boats, who had been arrested and held in the Koror jail for 17 days. Most of the men had never been to sea before, nor did they know the name of their ship, the fishing company or even their captain. Most had handed their identity cards over to the fishing company, which had hired them only several months earlier. Many claimed that they fled that day because they thought the Palauans, who were not in uniform, were planning to rob them. \u2018\u2018He claims that he does not know about any fishing permits,\u2019\u2019 a police investigator said of one deckhand. \u2018\u2018They only follow what the captain tells them.\u2019\u2019The crew members pleaded guilty and were fined $1,000 each. Their small fast boat was destroyed, their gear confiscated. They were then flown home, with their slain colleague, Yong Lu, in a coffin, on a charter flight sent by the Chinese government. One line in the investigation report struck me. It said that in several days of poaching, the Chinese crew caught fewer than a dozen fish, primarily lapu lapu, and several large clams, most of which they later threw overboard as they fled the authorities. It seemed a tragically small yield.In the wheel room of the Remeliik that night, the officers did a post mortem about the day\u2019s boarding, and the discussion turned to the crews that work on these poacher ships. \u2018\u2018Aren\u2019t they the enemy?\u2019\u2019 I asked. Several officers shook their heads to say no. Once the authorities take the foreign crews to shore, there is no guarantee that Palau will have the translators to communicate with them, jail space to hold them or even the laws to effectively prosecute them. Many of the poachers they arrest are from family-owned businesses and are unable to pay the $500,000 fine Palau has the option to levy. The government can seize the ship, but the cost to feed, house and repatriate the crew is often more than its resale value.Near the end of our patrol, Baiei asked me if I had ever seen a diver with the bends. I said I hadn\u2019t. He explained that many of the poachers they chase are Vietnamese, young divers who target sea cucumbers, which live on the ocean floor and look like giant, leather-skinned slugs. The Vietnamese crewmen hold rubber hoses in their mouths attached to an onboard air compressor, strap lead weights around their waists, then dive, often deeper than a hundred feet. During an arrest last year, Baiei said, one of these divers shot to the surface too quickly, causing excruciating bubbles to form in his joints and elsewhere. They took him to a hospital to recover. \u2018\u2018He just kept moaning for days,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said.One of the other officers, who had been listening to the conversation quietly, looked up from his inspection logs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the real bycatch,\u2019\u2019 he said. For Palau\u2019s police, the catch \u2014 the far more elusive target \u2014 was the fishing companies who send these desperate men to sea to flout the law. But in a sense, even those bosses are bycatch, too, in a worldwide fishing economy where sanctioned corporations, far more than poachers, are stripping the oceans of life. To save Palau\u2019s fish, and the world\u2019s, the law and its enforcers need to bring an entire industrial system to heel: a mission that requires a level of international cooperation and political will that has yet to materialize.An article on Feb. 21 about the efforts taken by Palau to stop illegal fishing in its waters referred incorrectly to the percentage of illegally caught fish that is consumed. One in every five fish consumed globally \u2014 not in the United States \u2014 is caught illegally.Ian Urbina is an investigative reporter who has been on the staff at The New York Times since 2003.Advertisement"}

The major party and state-run news organizations have been greatly expanding their operations overseas, including in the United States.\u201cI think the sense is, \u2018We own you, we run you, we tell you how things work,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The party is the center, and you serve our agenda.\u2019 This is much more central now, and it\u2019s being defined for all media platforms, from social media to commercial media.\u201dUnder Mr. Xi, there has been a steady rollout of policies aimed at tightening control of every aspect of the media, including social networks, films and books.Articles on Mr. Xi\u2019s policy speech, which was not immediately released in full, said the president also demanded that journalists and news organizations \u201cstrictly adhere to the news viewpoint of Marxism\u201d and \u201craise high the banner\u201d \u2014 phrases that mean advancing the interests of the party.Mr. Xi\u2019s policy has been building piecemeal.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stance Highlights a More Confrontational Tech Industry", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAfter revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.There will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public\u2019s collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what\u2019s to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?Apple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.Apple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple\u2019s public opposition to the government\u2019s request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.You can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government\u2019s reach.That\u2019s not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201dOne relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201creasonable assistance\u201d will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.In other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes\u00ad.com; Twitter:@fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueMost companies say they want to attract a diverse workforce, but few deliver. The only solution may be a radical one: anonymity.Supported byGapJumpers was already working from the insight that, like musicians, coders created something that could easily be evaluated by their peers. But Iyer realized from the study that employers didn\u2019t need to see prospective employees\u2019 faces, or even learn their names. Eventually, they would have to meet, but by keeping the process blind for as long as possible, Iyer figured he could help reduce bias. And, besides, he was already working with the best tool for masking identity in the history of humankind: software.Google likes to hire people who possess something it calls Googleyness, an amorphous measure of how well they will fit in. It\u2019s not easily defined, but it includes things like enjoying fun and \u2014 appropriately \u2014 coping well with ambiguity. This emphasis on \u2018\u2018culture fit\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t unique to Google; it seems to have spread across industries as work hours have lengthened and eaten into our leisure time, and as offices, especially in the valley, have further blurred the distinction between work and leisure. What a candidate might be like in a conference room at 10 a.m. has become almost as important as what he\u2019d be like playing Ping-Pong after a few beers from the office kegerator.\u2018\u2018The pipeline argument can be wiped out with basic statistics,\u2019\u2019 Beasley says. \u2018\u2018The number of people graduating from top schools is just enormous, so you have to think, What could these companies do wrong to not get them?\u2019\u2019One answer is that companies rely too much on flawed human judgment when they recruit. Despite the digitization of job listings, human-resources departments have not changed much from the analog days. And, according to decades of research on the topic, humans just aren\u2019t that good at hiring. A study of top banking, law and consulting firms found that similarities in things like leisure activities and personality were the most important factor in their evaluation of candidates. Hiring now resembles choosing a romantic partner more than an employee, says Lauren Rivera, an associate professor of management and sociology at Northwestern and the author of the study.To try to combat these biases, Iyer and his co-founder Petar Vujosevic devised a way to screen job applicants without showing employers any biographical information. GapJumpers and its client create a list of skills required for the job, then design a relevant test that the applicant completes online. The first piece of information the hiring company sees is applicants\u2019 scores, and, based on those, it selects candidates to interview. Only then does it see their names and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.GapJumpers has conducted more than 1,400 auditions for companies like Bloomberg and Dolby Laboratories. According to the company\u2019s numbers, using conventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening, about a fifth of applicants who were not white, male, able-bodied people from elite schools made it to a first-round interview. Using blind auditions, 60 percent did. \u2018\u2018Employers say, \u2018If you can show me your skills in this role, I am willing to interview you, regardless of where you come from, what you look like or who you are,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Iyer says. A new study from Harvard Business School backs up this line of reasoning. It found that when service-sector employers used a job test, they hired workers who tended to stay at the job longer \u2014 indicating that they were a better match. When employers overruled the test results to hire someone for more subjective reasons, the employees were significantly more likely to quit or be fired.GapJumpers is just one of a handful of Silicon Valley start-ups peddling technological fixes for hiring practices. Gild, for example, has proprietary software that finds candidates based on code they have published online and strips out biographical information before recommending them to employers. Textio, a start-up with clients that include Starbucks and Microsoft, scans job listings and highlights language that data have shown to turn off certain candidates. For example, saying a job requires a \u2018\u2018rock star\u2019\u2019 will draw more men than women; saying it requires a \u2018\u2018passion for learning\u2019\u2019 attracts more women than men. Textio\u2019s research has found that while most people dislike corporate jargon \u2014 \u2018\u2018synergy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018push the envelope\u2019\u2019 and so on \u2014 applicants who are not white dislike it even more and are less likely to respond to job listings that use that sort of language.At Google, interviewers now use standardized questions, mostly abandoning the brainteasers, according to Laszlo Bock, its head of people operations \u2014 the Google term for H.R. They stopped asking for SAT scores, a practice that research has shown underestimates the college performance of women and minority students. They have tried to build diversity into the definition of \u2018\u2018Googleyness,\u2019\u2019 like whether someone has taken an interesting life path or solves problems in a different way. Google says it is hiring more black and Latino employees these days, but this increase has yet to affect its diversity numbers.Silicon Valley is in many ways an odd place to be at the forefront of the solution to the problem of corporate homogeneity. Its work force is strikingly uniform: The diversity numbers from Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies look no better than Google\u2019s. But it\u2019s also one of the few industries in which even the biggest companies are young and nimble enough to quickly change the way they do business, and one that desperately needs more qualified workers.Workplace practices that start in Silicon Valley often spread to other industries \u2014 like open office arrangements, and yoga classes. Despite its reputation today, the tech industry could one day become a model for other industries. If so, the American workplace could soon look less like the people who are doing the hiring and more like the people graduating with the skills to join it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narrow Focus May Aid F.B.I. in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byInstead, the F.B.I. took the industry by surprise and cleverly stopped short of expectations. The bureau asked Apple for something very specific: that it create an alternative operating system for just one phone that would help the government break into the device. The limited nature of the request has helped the government portray this case as a one-time demand, without ramifications beyond the case at hand.While the F.B.I. is pursuing a narrow focus, Apple is arguing its side as broadly as possible.The company has repeatedly said this case is about much more than the iPhone of one of the attackers from a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14. The company has framed the government\u2019s request as a larger discussion of privacy and civil liberties, and a slippery slope that could open the way to similar demands in the future.The differing approaches are set to be the core of each side\u2019s arguments as Apple and the United States government dig in for an extended period of legal wrangling. Both are betting that their narrow-versus-broad lines of reasoning will help them win both in court and in the court of public opinion.For now, while civil liberties groups and many tech companies say they side with Apple, the government may have carved out an advantage by proffering its narrow argument.\u201cBy making its request so targeted, Apple has fewer grounds to argue their side than had the government asked it to permanently change its code,\u201d said Jason Healey, a former White House security policy director and a research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks that Mr. Cook had made.The greatest fear among many privacy and computer security advocates was that the government would try to force Apple to give up the security keys it uses to digitally sign its code, keys that would let government programmers disable Apple\u2019s security.Instead, the F.B.I. understood that Apple can cleanly install new software on broken phones, without replacing them, and asked the company to make a similar tool that would let investigators break into a work phone issued to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.The bureau has taken pains to note that it did not ask Apple to break the password, and that this solution would not work on newer phones.On Sunday, Mr. Comey\u2019s statement to defend why the agency needed to break into the iPhone said that the court order \u201cisn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.\u201dF.B.I. technical specialists have been working with companies to figure out how to extract data from phones for years.A government official said on Monday that investigators quickly realized that in the San Bernardino case, a technical solution was available. \u201cThis was just the logical extension to what we were already doing,\u201d one senior government official said.\u201cI think Apple was hoping that the request that came was more outrageous,\u201d said Dan Guido, the founder of the security firm Trail of Bits. \u201cThe F.B.I. was very adroit. They waited for the perfect situation where they had all these factors aligned so the request looks pretty straightforward.\u201dTo that point, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., criticized Apple after it refused to comply with the court order and said that they currently possessed 175 iPhones that they could not unlock.Charlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.Mr. Vance responded: \u201cAbsolutely right.\u201dEven people who oppose the Justice Department\u2019s request concede the government made a smart first move, one that could establish precedent to justify more invasive tactics.\u201cThey\u2019ll come up with a reason why for every single phone,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former White House security adviser who, while in government, said he opposed this tactic. But as a strategic matter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s tactically brilliant.\u201dSome citizens and politicians have attacked Apple\u2019s decision, like the families of the San Bernardino victims, Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Senators Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins.To gird for the fight, Apple has hired Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Theodore B. Olson, partners at Gibson Dunn, as outside counsel. Both men have a long history of pushing the courts and the public to see the bigger picture on heated issues including gay marriage.But privately, there is talk among these companies that Apple may have overplayed its hand by taking the issue public in an all-out defiant assault against the F.B.I., according to two people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. These people fear the public may eventually sympathize with the F.B.I.\u2019s argument, especially considering the heinous nature of the crimes.Apple proposed in its statement that federal prosecutors de-escalate the situation by withdrawing their demands, and \u201cas some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the government\u2019s strategy in seeking to force Apple to help it open a terrorist\u2019s iPhone misspelled the surname of one of Apple\u2019s outside lawyers.

The deal would give the buyers a name that has faded amid intense competition from Google\u2019s Chrome and other browsers but still has a following in the developing world.Opera, a Norwegian browser developed in the 1990s, gained prominence a decade ago with a browser designed specifically for mobile phones that used compression technology to speed download times. But others have caught up, and Opera \u2014 with a 5.5 percent market share \u2014 is now the sixth most-used browser behind Chrome, Apple\u2019s Safari, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer, Firefox and Alibaba\u2019s UCWeb, according to the Internet metrics firm StatCounter.Still, Opera has pockets of strength in some fast-growing Internet markets. It is the top browser in Africa, according to StatCounter, and it is the third most popular in Russia and India and the fourth in Indonesia.Opera Software, the browser\u2019s parent company, said in August last year that it was undertaking a strategic review. It has reported annual losses over the past two years, and its growth prospects have disappointed investors. Even after takeover rumors drove up its shares in recent days, they are still down about one-quarter from a year ago.The group has offered 71 Norwegian kroner, or $8.31, a share, a premium of about 56 percent, based on the average share price over the past 30 days.Opera said that the agreement would give Opera access to Kunlun and Qihoo\u2019s Internet users in China, as well as funding. Kunlun and Qihoo will also be able to sell their products to Opera users and use its mobile advertising platform.Qihoo runs its own mobile browser, which it could combine with Opera\u2019s, and it also could benefit from the company\u2019s advertising network. Kunlun, which makes and licenses games, could use Opera\u2019s apps as a way to broaden the distribution of those games.Opera\u2019s board has unanimously decided to recommend that shareholders accept the offer.The deal is still conditional on Kunlun\u2019s getting approval at its general meeting in March to participate in the consortium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Technologies Give Government Ample Means to Track Suspects, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than two years the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies have warned that encrypted communications are creating a \u201cgoing dark\u201d crisis that will keep them from tracking terrorists and kidnappers.Now, a study in which current and former intelligence officials participated concludes that the warning is wildly overblown, and that a raft of new technologies \u2014 like television sets with microphones and web-connected cars \u2014 are creating ample opportunities for the government to track suspects, many of them worrying.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Going dark\u2019 does not aptly describe the long-term landscape for government surveillance,\u201d concludes the study, to be published Monday by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.The study argues that the phrase ignores the flood of new technologies \u201cbeing packed with sensors and wireless connectivity\u201d that are expected to become the subject of court orders and subpoenas, and are already the target of the National Security Agency as it places \u201cimplants\u201d into networks around the world to monitor communications abroad.The products, ranging from \u201ctoasters to bedsheets, light bulbs, cameras, toothbrushes, door locks, cars, watches and other wearables,\u201d will give the government increasing opportunities to track suspects and in many cases reconstruct communications and meetings.Over the past year, they have repeatedly told Congress that the move by Apple to automatically encrypt data on its iPhone, and similar steps by Google and Microsoft, are choking off critical abilities to track suspects, even with a court order.President Obama, however, concluded last fall that any effort to legislate a government \u201cback door\u201d into encrypted communications would probably create a pathway for hackers \u2014 including those working for foreign governments like Russia, China and Iran \u2014 to gain access as well, and create a precedent for authoritarian governments demanding similar access.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has led the charge on the other side. He recently told a group of White House officials seeking technology companies\u2019 voluntary help to counter the Islamic State that the government\u2019s efforts to get the keys to encrypted communications would be a boon for hackers and put legitimate business transactions, financial data and personal communications at greater risk.The Harvard study, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, was unusual because it involved technical experts, civil libertarians and officials who are, or have been, on the forefront of counterterrorism. Larry Kramer, the former dean of Stanford Law School, who heads the foundation, noted Friday that until now \u201cthe policy debate has been impeded by gaps in trust \u2014 chasms, really \u2014 between academia, civil society, the private sector and the intelligence community\u201d that have impeded the evolution of a \u201csafe, open and resilient Internet.\u201dAmong the chief authors of the report is Matthew G. Olsen, who was a director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Mr. Obama and a general counsel of the National Security Agency.Two current senior officials of the N.S.A. \u2014 John DeLong, the head of the agency\u2019s Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, the agency\u2019s chief risk officer \u2014 are described in the report as \u201ccore members\u201d of the group, but did not sign the report because they could not act on behalf of the agency or the United States government in endorsing its conclusions, government officials said.\u201cEncryption is a real problem, and the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies are right to raise it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said Sunday. But he noted that in their testimony officials had not described the other technological breaks that are falling their way, nor had they highlighted cases in which they were able to exploit mistakes made by suspects in applying encryption to their messages.He noted that in the current stalemate there was little discussion of the \u201cever-expanding \u2018Internet of things,\u2019 where telemetry from teakettles, televisions and light bulbs might prove surprisingly, and worryingly, amenable to subpoena from governments around the world.\u201dThose technologies are already being exploited: The government frequently seeks location data from devices like cellphones and EZ Passes to track suspects.The study notes that such opportunities are expanding rapidly. A Samsung \u201csmart\u201d television contains a microphone meant to relay back to Samsung voice instructions to the TV \u2014 \u201cI want to see the last three \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movies\u201d \u2014 and a Hello, Barbie brought out by Mattel last year records children\u2019s conversations with the doll, processes them over the Internet and sends back a response.The history of technology shows that what is invented for convenience can soon become a target of surveillance. \u201cLaw enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target,\u201d the report said.These communications, too, may one day be encrypted. But Google\u2019s business model depends on picking out key words from emails to tailor advertisements for specific users of Gmail, the popular email service. Apple users routinely back up the contents of their phones to iCloud \u2014 a service that is not encrypted and now is almost a routine target for investigators or intelligence agencies. So are the tracking and mapping systems for cars that rely on transmitted global positioning data.\u201cI think what this report shows is that the world today is like living in a big field that is more illuminated than ever before,\u201d said Joseph Nye, a Harvard government professor and former head of the National Intelligence Council. \u201cThere will be dark spots \u2014 there always will be. But it\u2019s easy to forget that there is far more data available to governments now than ever before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Promise of Artificial Intelligence Unfolds in Small Steps", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWhen IBM\u2019s Watson computer triumphed over human champions in the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d it was a stunning achievement that suggested limitless horizons for artificial intelligence.Soon after, IBM\u2019s leaders moved to convert Watson from a celebrated science project into a moneymaking business, starting with health care.Yet the next few years after its game show win proved humbling for Watson. Today, IBM executives candidly admit that medicine proved far more difficult than they anticipated. Costs and frustration mounted on Watson\u2019s early projects. They were scaled back, refocused and occasionally shelved.IBM\u2019s early struggles with Watson point to the sobering fact that commercializing new technology, however promising, typically comes in short steps rather than giant leaps.Despite IBM\u2019s own challenges, Watson\u2019s TV victory \u2014 five years ago this month \u2014 has helped fuel interest in A.I. from the public and the rest of the tech industry. Venture capital investors have poured money into A.I. start-ups, and large corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have been buying fledgling A.I. companies. That investment reached $8.5 billion last year, more than three and a half times the level in 2010, according to Quid, a data analysis firm.And software engineers with A.I. skills are treated like star athletes, prompting bidding wars for their services.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a peak of excitement now,\u201d said Jerry Kaplan, a computer scientist, entrepreneur and author, who was a co-founder of a long-forgotten A.I. start-up in the 1980s. \u201cExpectations are way ahead of reality.\u201dThe term A.I. has long been a staple of science fiction \u2014 as machines that think for themselves and help humankind or as ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out. Or so the thinking at the movies goes.The reality, however, is a little less dramatic. The automated voice on your smartphone that tries to answer your questions? That\u2019s a type of A.I. So are features of Google\u2019s search engine. The technology is also being applied to complex business problems like finding trends in cancer research.The field of artificial intelligence goes back to the beginning of the computer age and it has rolled through cycles of optimism and disillusion ever since, encouraged by a few movie robots and one very successful game show contestant.The history of tech tells A.I. backers to hang in there. Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.Predictions made in the \u201990s about how the new World Wide Web would shake the foundations of the media, advertising and retailing industries did prove to be true, for example. But it happened a decade later, years after the dot-com bust.Today\u2019s A.I., even optimists say, is early in that cycle.\u201cI think future generations are going to look back on the A.I. revolution and compare its impact to the steam engine or electricity,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cBut, of course, it is going to take decades for this technology to really come to fruition.\u201dThere are reasons for enthusiasm. Computers continue to get cheaper even as they get more powerful, making it easier than ever to crunch vast amounts of data in an instant. Also, sensors, smartphones and other tech devices are all over the place, feeding more and more information into computers that are learning more and more about us.Just in the last year or two, researchers have made rapid gains using a machine-learning technique called deep learning to improve the performance of software that recognizes images, translates languages and understands speech. That work has been done at start-ups and at big companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, as well as at universities and private research centers like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\u201cThere\u2019s been surprising progress in the problems of perception, seeing, hearing and language,\u201d said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research.At Enlitic, a start-up in San Francisco, Jeremy Howard, the founder and chief executive, believes that A.I. can transform the huge industry of health care, saving lives and money \u2014 an ambition similar to IBM\u2019s. \u201cBut that\u2019s a 25-year project,\u201d he said.Enlitic is concentrating first on radiology. Medical images are nearly all in digital form, Mr. Howard notes, and the tireless scanning for telltale signs of abnormal tissue is a task for which deep-learning image recognition technology is well suited.Enlitic has tested its software against a database of 6,000 lung cancer diagnoses, both positive and negative, made by professional radiologists. In research soon to be published, its algorithm was 50 percent more accurate than human radiologists, Enlitic said.\u201cYou have to take technology that works and apply it to a known problem,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cInnovation alone is a mistake.\u201dNo company has made as big or as broad a bid to commercialize its A.I. technology as IBM has with Watson. It set up Watson as its own business in 2014, and invested billions to accelerate the development and adoption of the technology, including buying several companies. The Watson unit now has 7,000 employees.The Watson technology has been totally revamped. In its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d days, Watson was a room-size computer. Today, it is so-called cloud software, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers. The Watson software itself has been carved up into dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition.IBM is trying to position Watson as the equivalent of an A.I. operating system, a software platform others use to build applications. Nearly 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software. IBM now has more than 500 industry partners, from big companies to start-ups, in industries including health care, financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services.At IBM, Watson\u2019s early struggles in health care are viewed as a learning experience. The IBM teams, the executives say, underestimated the difficulty of grappling with messy data like faxes and handwritten notes and failed to understand how physicians make decisions.\u201cThere were a lot of challenges with the early customers,\u201d said John Kelly, the senior vice president who oversees Watson, adding that the business was \u201ctaking off\u201d now.IBM does not break out financial results for Watson. It describes the business as \u201clarge and growing,\u201d contributing to the company\u2019s $18 billion a year in revenue from business analytics.At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Watson technology is one ingredient in an automated expert adviser for cancer care. The University of Texas health system is also using Watson in software to help diabetes patients and caregivers manage the disease, in a project that is expected to be introduced by the end of this year.\u201cIt was a lot harder than we thought,\u201d said Dr. Lynda Chin, the chief innovation officer for the university health system. \u201cBut our experience has convinced me that we can build an A.I. engine that improves care.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about.The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.\u201cWe need to make the economics work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand that every round of funding must be treated as our last.\u201dDriving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown \u2014 exacerbated in Europe by the region\u2019s migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves. As a result, venture capitalists in Europe and farther afield are becoming more cautious about funding local start-ups that do not have proven business ideas.\u201cWhen Silicon Valley sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,\u201d said Fred Destin, a partner at the London office of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before Europe faces the same issues that we\u2019re seeing on the West Coast.\u201dIn Europe, that is leading to situations like that of Powa Technologies. Last week , Powa, an e-commerce company based in London, entered into administration, a form of bankruptcy. The start-up had raised $175 million since 2013 but had failed to win enough customers for its mobile shopping technology. Deloitte, which is overseeing the sale of the company\u2019s assets, says it is now working to find buyers for the business.\u201cYou can already see more hesitance and lower valuations,\u201d Christian Reber, founder of 6Wunderkinder, a German start-up bought by Microsoft last year, said in an email. \u201cThe market correction will continue, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\u201d\u201cEurope didn\u2019t fly as high as Silicon Valley,\u201d said Par-Jorgen Parson, general partner at the Swedish venture firm Northzone, an early backer of Spotify. \u201cThat means it also won\u2019t fall as far, either.\u201dNow, he plans to double down on his core markets, including the United States and France, in hopes of convincing small-scale fashion houses that Tictail can be their primary means of reaching people who increasingly rely on mobile devices to make their everyday purchases.\u201cWe were incredibly lucky with our timing\u201d when getting funding, said Mr. Waldekranz, who splits his time between New York and Stockholm. \u201cWe may have a competitive advantage as the market tightens up.\u201dStill, as American investor sentiment spreads across the Atlantic, European venture capitalists said they were warning start-ups that new capital would be tougher to come by than in previous years.

{"Headline": "Dropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSo what\u2019s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\u2019s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.\u201dOther numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the company\u2019s service \u2014 a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers \u2014 and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropbox\u2019s revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the company\u2019s annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\u201cDropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever \u2014 like LinkedIn or Salesforce,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we couldn\u2019t be thrilled with that kind of performance.\u201dBut if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world \u2014 the trend toward business software that doesn\u2019t stink, known as the \u201cconsumerization of information technology,\u201d and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropbox\u2019s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s. When Dropbox visits a company\u2019s chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show \u2014 a large base of the company\u2019s employees who are already using its service.\u201cWe fish in a pond that\u2019s used to our product,\u201d Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropbox\u2019s potential for profit was more attractive than Box\u2019s, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, disputed this assertion. \u201cOur differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers,\u201d he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\u2019s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.An earlier version of this column misstated the fees Dropbox charges its business customers. The fees are about $150 annually for each of the business\u2019s employees, not for each business.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Yahoo Employee-Ranking System Favored by Marissa Mayer Is Challenged in Court", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byNow, as Ms. Mayer prepares to announce a streamlining plan on Tuesday that is likely to involve even more job cuts, one former manager who lost his job is challenging the entire system as discriminatory and a violation of federal and California laws governing mass layoffs.Mr. Anderson said the cuts, including what his boss said was the firing of about 600 other low-performing Yahoo employees at the time of his termination, amounted to illegal mass layoffs.Under California law, the layoff of more than 50 employees within 30 days at a single location like Yahoo\u2019s Sunnyvale headquarters requires an employer to give workers 60 days of advance notice. A similar federal law, known as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires advance notice for a layoff of 500 or more employees.Yahoo has never provided such notices. But it did cut 1,100 employees over a period of months in late 2014 and early 2015, ostensibly for performance reasons.In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in San Jose, Calif., Gregory Anderson, an editor at Yahoo who was fired in November 2014, alleges that the company\u2019s senior managers routinely manipulated the rating system to fire hundreds of people without just cause to achieve the company\u2019s financial goals.If the court finds that Yahoo violated either law, it could be forced to pay each affected employee $500 a day plus back pay and benefits for each day of advance notice it failed to provide.The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is also investigating the use of ratings in the firing of another Yahoo employee, according to Jon R. Parsons, Mr. Anderson\u2019s lawyer.Fahizah Alim, a spokeswoman for the California agency, confirmed that such an inquiry was underway, but said she could not provide further information because of confidentiality rules.In a statement, Yahoo defended its rating system. \"Our performance review process also allows for high performers to engage in increasingly larger opportunities at our company, as well as for low performers to be transitioned out,\" the company said. Yahoo also said that Mr. Anderson\u2019s specific claims had no merit and that he had sought a $5 million settlement from the company just before filing the suit.Ms. Mayer has steadfastly refused to use the word \u201clayoff\u201d to describe the thousands of jobs eliminated since she joined the company. She even forbade her managers from uttering what she called \u201cthe L-word,\u201d instructing them to use the term \u201cremix\u201d instead.Ms. Mayer, who has presided over a continued decline in Yahoo\u2019s financial performance, faces pressure from activist investors to sell the company\u2019s Internet businesses or otherwise radically restructure the business. She has promised to unveil a new strategy on Tuesday, when Yahoo reports its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015, although people with knowledge of her thinking say that the changes she will announce will be modest.Mr. Anderson\u2019s suit provides a peek inside Yahoo\u2019s controversial quarterly performance review system, which Ms. Mayer adopted on the recommendation of McKinsey & Company, a management consulting company. Similar systems were once widely used in corporate America, and companies like Amazon.com still employ analogous methods.But others, like General Electric and Microsoft, have dropped such rankings as a tool for routine firings because of their corrosive effect on productivity and employee morale.\u201cThe Q.P.R. process was opaque and the employees did not know who was making the final decisions, what numbers were being assigned by whom along the way, or why those numbers were being changed,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThis manipulation of the Q.P.R. process permitted employment decisions, including terminations, to be made on the basis of personal biases and stereotyping.\u201dMr. Anderson said that in his case, he had received high ratings and a promotion before taking a leave of absence in the summer of 2014 to study at the University of Michigan on a Knight-Wallace Fellowship. Although the fellowship leave was approved by two top Yahoo executives, Kathy Savitt and Jackie Reses, who have since left the company, Mr. Anderson said that his boss\u2019s boss, Megan Liberman, called him on Nov. 10 to inform him that he was in the bottom 5 percent of the company\u2019s work force, all of whom were being fired.In the suit, Mr. Anderson said he was fired for several reasons unrelated to performance. He said he had complained to management about the impact of the Q.P.R. process on the people he supervised and had reported an attempted bribe by one employee who wanted him to reduce another employee\u2019s rating.He also alleged gender discrimination, claiming that the media group, which was overseen by Ms. Savitt and Ms. Liberman, systematically favored women in hiring, promotions and layoffs.Mr. Anderson, who had worked at Yahoo\u2019s headquarters, said he was \u201cstranded\u201d in Michigan with his family because of the firing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
