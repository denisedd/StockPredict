{"Headline": "Apple Showdown Heightens Challenge of Encrypted Data", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchThe Fourth Amendment grants a measure of privacy for \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d while requiring that warrants be issued based only on probable cause. But those protections do not go far in preventing the government from gaining access to a person\u2019s digital information in an investigation because probable cause is a low standard for getting a warrant.A much greater stumbling block for the government in obtaining encrypted data is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which can be used to thwart efforts to get passwords required to unlock encrypted files. In the world of cryptology, a secret code known only to the user usually means that the information could be kept away from the government unless there is a means to compel the person to reveal it.The Fifth Amendment provides that an individual cannot be forced to be \u201ca witness against himself,\u201d which generally means the government cannot force someone to disclose information that can be used to convict that person. But whether it lets a person shield electronic files is a more complicated issue.The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination came up last year in an insider trading case, and it illustrates how the courts have struggled to adapt the Fifth Amendment to gaining access to digital information.In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Huang, two defendants were accused of gathering confidential information from their employer, Capital One, about credit card usage at retailers to help identify which companies to buy shares. The bank provided smartphones to its employees, and each had a personal passcode known only to the user. The S.E.C. suspected that the defendants\u2019 phones, which they returned to Capital One after resigning, contained information that would be helpful to proving the case, so it asked for a court order directing them to reveal their codes so the files could be opened.The defendants asserted the Fifth Amendment, claiming that revealing the codes could lead to potentially incriminating evidence useful in a criminal case because insider trading violations can be prosecuted by the Justice Department.The problem is figuring out how far the privilege against self-incrimination goes in protecting passwords that can open encrypted files.But the court then noted that the act of turning over the records, called the \u201cact of production,\u201d could convey information about their existence, possession and authenticity, and therefore that could be the basis for asserting the privilege against self-incrimination.As if that\u2019s not confusing enough, the Supreme Court in the Fisher case then explained that the government could still force an individual to turn over documents if any information conveyed by the act of production was a \u201cforegone conclusion,\u201d meaning the government learned little new from turning them over.The nub of the issue is this: Does turning over a password to open up encrypted files reveal new information from the person\u2019s mind, or is it just like handing over a folder with documents the government already knows exists and is at your house?This is where the challenge of digital information makes the Fifth Amendment analysis more difficult. A password is a bit like a key, because it simply opens up files contained in the electronic version of a file cabinet. But it is also similar to the combination to a safe, such as the use of numbers in a specific sequence in the code.Figuring out which one it is has divided the courts. In the Huang case, the district judge denied the request to reveal the passwords, finding that \u201cas the S.E.C is not seeking business records but defendants\u2019 personal thought processes, defendants may properly invoke their Fifth Amendment right.\u201dIt turned out that denying access to the smartphones did not affect the case, as one defendant settled and a jury found the other engaged in insider trading.Obtaining access to electronic files, especially emails and messages, can be crucial in white-collar crime cases. Proving a violation usually revolves around establishing a defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent, so there is often no better proof than contemporaneous communications and documents created around the time of the transaction. If encryption keeps that kind of information away from investigators, it will make proving violations that much more difficult.Unlike an individual, companies cannot use the Fifth Amendment to encrypt their files to keep them away from the government because that constitutional protection does not apply to organizations. With the Justice Department\u2019s recent emphasis on identifying individuals involved in corporate misconduct as the primary measure of cooperation, getting to the personal data of employees can be crucial to proving a case, especially if companies encourage them to encrypt files as a security measure.It may be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals from having to turn over passwords to help the government obtain evidence that may well end up convicting them.The digital age is making it much more difficult to figure out how far the Constitution should go in dealing with forms of information that were largely unknown a generation ago, much less when the Fifth Amendment was adopted.Advertisement"}

Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201dHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201dIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tips and Myths About Extending Smartphone Battery Life", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byTech FixAshlei Teme\u00f1a\u2019s family trip to Disneyland last Thanksgiving break turned into a nightmare when her smartphone battery hit empty.Ms. Teme\u00f1a, a San Francisco support technician, had gotten separated from her family and realized she had no way to find anyone. Instead of riding roller coasters, she wandered around searching for the group \u2014 eventually locating them four hours later watching fireworks.\u201cI wanted to throw my phone on the ground by the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Teme\u00f1a said.Many consumers can relate. Despite the leaps forward in mobile phone technology with crisp, clear screens and faster chips, batteries have made only sluggish progress. That has propelled a desire for longer battery life to the top of the list of factors considered by consumers when they purchase smartphones, according to a 2014 survey by the research firm IDC.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investments on all fronts for improving the technology above and beyond that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that hitting any kind of mass market for several years out,\u201d Mr. Quong said. In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.The results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life \u2014 like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone\u2019s apps \u2014 produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.The Wirecutter tested a range of recent Apple and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone\u2019s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold. Here are eight tips and seven myths busted by our findings:A smartphone\u2019s screen consumes more energy than any other component, so the easiest way to cut down battery drain is to reduce your screen brightness. In an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.But it\u2019s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on ambient light. The Wirecutter found that enabling auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life.When browsing the web, your smartphone also burns through power when it downloads mobile ads on websites. Installing an ad blocker will greatly extend battery life.Email can have a major impact on battery life if you have multiple email accounts and receive lots of email. Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there\u2019s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.The Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone\u2019s overall battery use.To save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or \u201cfetch\u201d) emails on a schedule \u2014 say, every 30 minutes \u2014 or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.The next tip may come as unwelcome news. Nowadays, online streaming is the most popular way to listen to music, with services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music \u2014 but this method guzzles lots of battery power. In the Wirecutter\u2019s tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10 percent of an iPhone\u2019s battery reserves; streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5 percent.Fortunately, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music still let you listen to songs the old-school way: by storing the music right on your device.You may have noticed that when you\u2019re in a place without good Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, your phone\u2019s battery seems to drain much more quickly. That\u2019s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.To conserve battery life, disable the phone\u2019s wireless circuitry. Airplane Mode, an option that will turn off all wireless features, is a quick and easy solution in areas with poor reception.Alternatively, you can disable (in your phone\u2019s settings) a single wireless feature. For example, if you have terrible wireless carrier coverage in your office, but Wi-Fi is great, disabling cellular connectivity while there will keep the phone from wasting energy trying to get a cellular connection while still letting you connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi.Consumers can get even better results with a bit of sleuthing. Both the iPhone and Android systems provide a simple way to see which apps are using a lot of battery power. For iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.On the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap the clock button to reveal information about how much of your battery life each app is consuming when you\u2019re actively using the app (\u201cscreen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackgd\u201d). On Android, the most useful information are the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time the app has been busy in the background.Be on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods in the background and are using a lot of battery power. Examples include an email app that spends lots of time checking for new messages even when your phone is asleep, a news reader that updates articles in the background or a fitness app that constantly monitors your location.If you find apps using up lots of energy in the background, disable their background activities. On an iPhone, go to the Settings app, tap General and then Background App Refresh and disable the background activities for any apps. On Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Data Usage, choose an app, then select \u201cRestrict Background Data\u201d for background data usage.If a location-based app is using a lot of power, especially in the background, there\u2019s a good chance the app is using GPS, Wi-Fi and the phone\u2019s sensors frequently. You can decide whether to disable location features for it (either via your phone\u2019s Location Services settings, or by changing settings in the app itself). On an iPhone, you can disable the app\u2019s ability to track your location by going to Privacy menu and Location Services.To disable location tracking on Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Apps, choose an app and select \u201cPermissions,\u201d then tap to disable Location permission.Both Apple and Google recommend disabling push notifications, which are essentially app alerts, to conserve battery life. Notifications require regular communication with notification servers, and each notification causes your phone to wake up for a few seconds, including turning on the screen, to show you a message and give you a chance to act on it.In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing, receiving a few dozen notifications over the course of an hour didn\u2019t noticeably affect battery usage. But if you get a lot of notifications each day, that energy use can add up. If a particular app or service (say, Twitter or your email client) is constantly producing notifications, consider disabling notifications for that app.On an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, tap the app name and disable Allow Notifications. On Android, disable notification in an app\u2019s settings menu, or long-press the notification itself and select the \u201ci\u201d icon. This will send you to that app\u2019s App Notifications settings, where you can block all notifications.There is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let\u2019s start with one of the worst \u201ctips\u201d: Closing (or force-quitting, as it\u2019s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone\u2019s components, so quitting them will save energy.While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground \u2014 meaning you are not actively using it \u2014 most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone\u2019s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.Finally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone\u2019s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.A common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you\u2019re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.Many apps that use your location do so only intermittently. Even using the Maps app for short navigation sessions doesn\u2019t use more than a few percent of your battery\u2019s capacity \u2014 and having the phone\u2019s screen continually on is a big part of why navigation uses a lot of power.In other words, don\u2019t disable all of your phone\u2019s location-based features just to extend your battery life. You won\u2019t see a big jump in use time, but you may end up disabling \u2014 and subsequently missing \u2014 useful features. Instead, check (using the tips above) to see if any of apps consuming the most battery life also track your location. If so, and if you don\u2019t need that location tracking, consider disabling it for those apps.Many people, and even smartphone vendors such as Apple, claim that using Wi-Fi for wireless data consumes less power than using a cellular signal, so you should use Wi-Fi whenever you can. However, the Wirecutter\u2019s testing found this isn\u2019t always the case.In testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone. On a Motorola Android phone, LTE used only 2 to 3 percent more power than Wi-Fi.In other words, as long as you have a good signal, you probably won\u2019t see a huge difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and it\u2019s probably not worth the hassle of switching between the two.Both iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to the iPhone or \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.Yet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won\u2019t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.Using Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone\u2019s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute. But just having the feature enabled isn\u2019t worth worrying about \u2014 and it can be quite convenient.A common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone\u2019s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it\u2019s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car \u2014 the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.Finally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There\u2019s some truth here: Many chargers \u2014 especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk \u2014 are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you\u2019re replacing your phone\u2019s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.For many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required \u201cconditioning\u201d or \u201ccalibrating,\u201d a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today\u2019s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.If you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories \u2014 which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable \u2014 can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone\u2019s battery.For days of smartphone power, the Anker PowerCore 15600 is the Wirecutter\u2019s pick if you need to charge a phone repeatedly or keep a full-size tablet and phone topped up through a busy week. It has enough available power to charge a typical smartphone five times or to fill a large tablet such as an iPad Air almost twice \u2014 for under $40.After her stressful day at Disneyland, Ms. Teme\u00f1a bought an external Amazon battery pack. She said the pack could fully charge her phone six times, but it wasn\u2019t ideal because of its bulk. Ultimately, she wishes her iPhone had a better battery.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a battery wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with all the other advances they\u2019re putting into phones now,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Explaining Apple\u2019s Fight With the F.B.I.", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byIn the hours after Apple\u2019s letter was published, technologists and legal experts have been dissecting what, exactly, the Cupertino, Calif., company can\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 do to help the government.What is the government asking for?The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants to examine the iPhone used by Syed Farook to determine whether he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, had planned the shooting directly with the Islamic State. The iPhone, a 5c version of the smartphone that was released in 2013, is locked by a passcode, which the F.B.I. wants Apple to circumvent.Apple would have to build a new version of its iOS smartphone software that allows the F.B.I. to bypass certain restrictions. Apple claims this software can give someone \u201cthe potential to unlock any iPhone in someone\u2019s physical possession.\u201dSo what does the court order require Apple to do?The court is ordering the company to \u201cbypass or disable\u201d a feature that automatically wipes an iPhone clean of all its data after 10 incorrect password attempts have been entered. This is a standard feature on iPhones.Technically, that would not require Apple to decrypt the passcode that blocks access by outsiders to the iPhone. It would allow the government to try an unlimited number of passwords without fear of the phone erasing all of its stored information.In electronic security parlance, that is what is called a \u201cbrute force\u201d attack, and all it takes is time and patience to submit a large number of passcodes. Brute force attacks are usually carried out with the assistance of a powerful computer, which can automatically input millions of different password combinations until it guesses the correct one.Can Apple comply with the order if it wants to?Apple\u2019s opposition is mostly ideological.\u201cThe same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, wrote in the letter.Apple argues that the software the F.B.I. wants it to create does not exist. But technologists say the company can do it.Why can\u2019t the F.B.I. build this software?The iPhone is designed to run only iOS software created by Apple. For the phone to recognize that the software was made by Apple, the company must sign each piece with an encrypted key to verify it. Even if the F.B.I. tried to build a new version of iOS, it would not have Apple\u2019s crucial signature.The agency argues that this is a one-time request and wants Apple to create software only to get into Mr. Farook\u2019s phone, not unlimited access to iPhones everywhere.Are there other ways for the F.B.I. to get this information?There is a lot of data available that does not require Apple\u2019s assistance in unlocking the phone. The F.B.I. could ask Verizon, the cellular carrier by which Mr. Farook\u2019s phone was serviced, to give the agency more information on the phone.The government could also request information from the application developers who created the apps for Mr. Farook\u2019s iPhone.But those are avenues the F.B.I. has probably already pursued, explaining why it wants Apple to unlock the device. Some data is not accessible without Apple\u2019s intervention.Are there other legal implications for the tech industry?What Apple is most worried about is the precedent that compliance can set for future requests from the government. There are few earlier rulings courts can use for guidance, and Apple does not want to pave the road for similar requests to itself and other tech companies.Other countries, like China, could also make similar demands.\u201cThe key question here is how far can the government go in forcing a third party to aid in surveillance?\u201d said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union.Apple will most likely file an appeal with the court in the coming days.Advertisement"}

But I must take umbrage at Apple\u2019s position regarding the unlocking of a terrorist\u2019s cellphone.This is not a fishing expedition. It is a single request for a single telephone in the aftermath of a heinous act, a request that has the imprimatur of a legally sought and granted court order.As much as Apple would like to believe that privacy is absolute, it is not. Not when the society that provides it is placed at grave and continuing risk. Apple has an obligation to that society to provide whatever protection is in its power to achieve.RICHARD M. FRAUENGLASSHuntington, N.Y.To the Editor:Maybe it\u2019s time to try a Solomonic solution to the standoff between Apple and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a phone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack.Apple maintains that the content on each of its customers\u2019 iPhones is uniquely encrypted and that it possesses no master key to unlock the data. The F.B.I. offers a workaround. It apparently wants Apple to load a new operating system onto the disputed phone, minus the feature that allows owners to have all their information erased if someone makes 10 failed passcode attempts.The F.B.I. would then use a computer to achieve entry by trying combinations of letters and numbers. The task would be herculean: There are hundreds of millions of possible combinations in a 32-character passcode alone.It seems to me that using such a method would isolate the defeat of Apple\u2019s security to this one phone.But to ensure that the tool has no chance of being used indiscriminately by law enforcement or slipping into the hands of criminals, the judge could modify her order. Tell Apple to delete the passcode protection on the phone in its own laboratories.The F.B.I. would be present but would have no access to the programming fix. Then let Apple conduct the \u201cbrute force\u201d maneuver to guess the passcode, transfer the phone data to a hard copy and then destroy the altered software or place it in a vault.Perhaps Apple would object to being forced to serve as an arm of law enforcement. But every day companies are pressed into complicity when they obey subpoenas to hand over phone or credit card records of a criminal suspect.Apple would be able to guarantee privacy to its law-abiding customers, while the government would not be crippled in its obligation to look for further potential accomplices to a horrible mass murder.FRANK SPENCER-MOLLOYSimsbury, Conn.To the Editor:The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not asking for a way to remotely hack into your phone without your knowledge. The backdoor the agency wants Apple to enable still requires physical possession of the phone, as well as of special hacking equipment and deep expertise. It cannot be used for mass data collection like that of the National Security Agency.Apple warns of enabling hackers and totalitarian governments. But what hackers have your physical phone? And what dictators are not already able to coerce you or Apple to unlock your phone?Current law permits cellphone searches. If we don\u2019t like a law, we should repeal it, not make it easier to evade.ILYA SHLYAKHTERCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:As an employee who works for a retailer for Apple and other cellphone products, I receive firsthand experience with Apple customers every day. Apple customers and those familiar with their devices openly recognize the company for the trademark safety measures that are taken with the encryption of its products.A right to privacy is an understandable priority to every individual, whether outside or within the United States. It is a priority to small family businesses and businesses that interact globally.Every day, I have the opportunity to work with a diverse network of Apple customers who proudly proclaim their human right to confidentiality with the purchase of their devices. We have experienced that right often taken away from us with an unjustified aim.I cheer the efforts Apple is making to protect that right, and I don\u2019t even have an iPhone.

{"Headline": "How Tim Cook, in iPhone Battle, Became a Bulwark for Digital Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Letters from around the globe began pouring into the inbox of Timothy D. Cook not long after the publication of the first revelations from Edward J. Snowden about mass government surveillance.Do you know how much privacy means to us? they asked Apple\u2019s chief executive. Do you understand?Mr. Cook did. He was proud that Apple sold physical products \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not traffic in the intimate, digital details of its customers\u2019 lives.\u201cWe feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,\u201d wrote Mr. Cook, 55. \u201cUltimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201dMr. Cook \u201csays what he believes, especially in difficult situations,\u201d said Don Logan, the former chairman of Time Warner Cable who has been friends with Mr. Cook since he became chief executive of Apple, bonding over their shared alma mater, Auburn University. Of Mr. Cook\u2019s opposition to the court order, Mr. Logan said: \u201cTim is currently dealing with a very difficult situation and he knows the decision he has made has lots of ramifications, good or bad. But he wants to do the right thing.\u201dApple declined to make Mr. Cook available for an interview. The company is preparing to file an opposition brief against the court order.Mr. Cook\u2019s ideas about civic duty were partly formed during his childhood in rural Alabama. In a speech at the United Nations in 2013, he recounted how Ku Klux Klansmen had once burned a cross on the lawn of a black family\u2019s home and how he yelled for them to stop. \u201cThis image was permanently imprinted in my brain, and it would change my life forever,\u201d he said.At Apple, which he joined as a senior executive in 1998, Mr. Cook was a quiet figure for much of the period when he worked for Mr. Jobs, a showman who prized secrecy at the company. After Mr. Jobs stepped down because of ailing health, Mr. Cook began making Apple more open, publishing an annual report on suppliers and working conditions for more than a million factory workers.His outspokenness has drawn criticism, with some investors questioning how nonbusiness initiatives \u2014 including some of Apple\u2019s environmental moves \u2014 would contribute to the company\u2019s bottom line. Mr. Cook responded at a shareholder meeting that it is important for Apple to do things \u201cbecause they\u2019re just and right.\u201dPrivacy has long been a priority for Mr. Cook. At a tech conference in 2010, he said Apple \u201chas always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.\u201d He cited the iPhone\u2019s feature that shows where a phone \u2014 and presumably its user \u2014 is and said fears about abuse and stalking had compelled the company to let consumers decide whether or not their apps could use their location data.Mr. Cook\u2019s views on privacy hardened over time as customers globally began entrusting more personal data to Apple\u2019s iPhones. At the same time, Apple was growing tired of requests from government officials worldwide asking the company to unlock smartphones.Each data-extraction request was carefully vetted by Apple\u2019s lawyers. Of those deemed legitimate, Apple in recent years required that law enforcement officials physically travel with the gadget to the company\u2019s headquarters, where a trusted Apple engineer would work on the phones inside Faraday bags, which block wireless signals, during the process of data extraction.Processing these requests was extremely tedious. More worrisome, the data stored on its customers iPhones was growing more personal, including photos, messages and bank, health and travel data.And some government officials were not exactly instilling confidence in Apple\u2019s engineers. In one case, after law enforcement officials rushed a phone to Apple\u2019s headquarters for data extraction, the engineers discovered their target had not enabled the device\u2019s passcode feature.So Mr. Cook and other Apple executives resolved not only to lock up customer data, but to do so in a way that would put the keys squarely in the hands of the customer, not the company. By the time Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system, iOS7, in September 2013, the company was encrypting all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones by default.\u201cPeople have a basic right to privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook has said.By then, Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about how the National Security Agency had cozied up to some tech companies and hacked others to gain user data were reverberating worldwide. The disclosures included revelations of a comprehensive, decade-long Central Intelligence Agency program to compromise Apple\u2019s products; C.I.A. analysts tampered with the products so the government could collect app makers\u2019 data. In other cases, the agency was embedding spy tools in Apple\u2019s hardware, and even modifying an Apple software update that allowed government analysts to record every keystroke.Letters from alarmed Apple customers started flooding into Mr. Cook\u2019s inbox, fortifying his stance on privacy. Apple\u2019s eighth mobile operating system, iOS8, which rolled out in September 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.For officials at the world\u2019s law enforcement agencies, the new software was a clear signal that Apple was growing defiant. A month after iOS8\u2019s release, James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., told an audience at the Brookings Institution that Apple had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d with the expanded encryption, arguing that the operating system effectively sealed off any chance of tracking kidnappers, terrorists and criminals.Government agencies began to press Apple and other tech companies for so-called back doors that could bypass strong security measures. With tensions rising, some form of technical compromise \u2014 whether in the form of a chip, a back door or a key \u2014 was off the table by 2015.At Apple, Mr. Cook and others continued to work with investigators to the extent the company could and complied with court orders. Last October, a federal judge in New York said the government was overstepping its boundaries by using a centuries-old law, the All Writs Act, as the basis for its request that Apple open an iPhone for a drug investigation. Apple\u2019s lawyer sided with the judge in the case. The matter has not been resolved.After December\u2019s San Bernardino attack, Apple worked with the F.B.I. to gather data that had been backed up to the cloud from a work iPhone issued to one of the assailants, according to court filings. When investigators also wanted unspecified information on the phone that had not been backed up, the judge this week granted the order requiring Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone\u2019s passcode and get into the device.Apple had asked the F.B.I. to issue its application for the tool under seal. But the government made it public, prompting Mr. Cook to go into bunker mode to draft a response, according to people privy to the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The result was the letter that Mr. Cook signed on Tuesday, where he argued that it set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d for a company to be forced to build tools for the government that weaken security.\u201cCompromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why encryption has become so important to all of us.\u201dFar from backing down from the fight, Mr. Cook has told colleagues that he still stands by the company\u2019s longstanding plans to encrypt everything stored on Apple\u2019s myriad devices, services and in the cloud, where the bulk of data is still stored unencrypted.\u201cIf you place any value on civil liberties, you don\u2019t do what law enforcement is asking,\u201d Mr. Cook has said.An earlier version of this article misstated the service Apple provided to law enforcement authorities. It extracted data from iPhones; it did not unlock them.Advertisement"}

But the industry has since come to believe, thanks to the Snowden documents, that despite their cooperation, national security agents were also hacking into their networks.Given that history, it should surprise no one that Apple is digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to create software that would help law enforcement gain access to a password-protected iPhone that belonged to one of the gunmen in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.After that?

{"Headline": "In Nod to Law Enforcement in Apple Case, Obama Ends Attempt to Straddle Privacy Divide", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, President Obama has struggled to reconcile a civil libertarian\u2019s belief in personal privacy with a commander in chief\u2019s imperatives for the nation\u2019s security.This week, security won.The decision by Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to force Apple to help it breach an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists has ended, at least for now, the president\u2019s attempts to straddle the feud over encryption between Silicon Valley and law enforcement.Asked about the president\u2019s backing of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s inquiry into San Bernardino, one of the worst terror attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Obama\u2019s press secretary declared on Wednesday that \u201cthe F.B.I. can count on the full support of the White House.\u201dThe decision may have been all but inevitable for Mr. Obama, who every morning receives a classified intelligence briefing about the terrorist threats facing the United States. But he took the position after years of trying to find middle ground on the issue.In a meeting with technology company executives in the Situation Room last spring, Mr. Obama pleaded with them to allow national security and law enforcement officials some access to private data, according to one participant in the room. In an interview last year with Re/Code, a technology website, Mr. Obama lamented being stuck, \u201csmack-dab in the middle of these tensions.\u201d\u201cI think he realizes there\u2019s no clear-cut answer here,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cBut if ever there was going to be a nod to the law enforcement view, this was the one to do it.\u201dFor much of his presidency, Mr. Obama has been unwilling to become a champion for either side, even as technological advances in encryption made a clash between privacy and security inevitable.After Edward J. Snowden exposed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs in 2013, the president repeatedly expressed support for the protection of user data on iPhones and other devices. But he also acknowledged the \u201clegitimate need\u201d to penetrate encryption, especially during terror investigations.Starting in 2010, top law enforcement officials for Mr. Obama, including officials at the F.B.I., began pushing for legislation to force technology companies to ensure that law enforcement agencies could have access to personal data. By 2015, Mr. Obama\u2019s administration had backed away from support for a new law, saying the president preferred to seek cooperation with Silicon Valley instead.Mr. Obama has a close relationship with Silicon Valley \u2014 he has dinners with its tech titans and raises money there \u2014 but like his predecessors, he has been torn by the responsibilities he faces every day: securing the country against terrorists, supporting criminal investigations and prosecuting a war against extremists who are increasingly turning to encrypted technologies to evade detection.\u201cThere are times where folks who see this through a civil liberties or privacy lens reject that there\u2019s any trade-offs involved, and in fact there are,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview with Re/Code. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that there are no trade-offs whatsoever.\u201dSeveral former Obama administration officials said they believed the president personally leaned, at least slightly, toward the view that technology companies must be allowed to secure personal data if they want to earn the trust of their customers.He also understands, they said, the problems that could arise if governments like China and Russia demand the same backdoor access to American technologies that the F.B.I. wants. In the same interview, he said, \u201cI lean probably further in the direction of strong encryption than some do inside of law enforcement.\u201dBut some civil libertarians view Mr. Obama as, at best, a weak supporter of their views and one who has too often been swayed by his national security and law enforcement apparatus.Some of those civil libertarians said Thursday that Mr. Obama\u2019s vocal support for the F.B.I.\u2019s aggressive legal tactics against Apple was evidence that the president is too willing to accede to the demands of his national security advisers. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, who in the past has expressed deep respect for Mr. Obama, has vowed to fight the order.\u201cThis is yet another disappointment in a string of disappointments when it comes to privacy,\u201d said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation.Mr. Bankston said the F.B.I.\u2019s decision to choose the San Bernardino case to press, legally, had been a smart way to put pressure on Mr. Obama and the technology companies. But he urged the president to consider the broader implications for privacy if Apple loses the case.\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s linked to the shootings makes it much more difficult politically,\u201d Mr. Bankston said. \u201cBut the answer is to highlight that it\u2019s not just about this case. It\u2019s about every encrypted device.\u201dMr. Schiff said the specifics of the California case might provide courts with the ability to narrow that impact. The phone in the case was owned by the terrorist\u2019s employer, who has given permission for law enforcement to search it. To do that, officials need Apple\u2019s help. If courts agree with the government, they might attempt to apply their ruling in limited cases.Regardless of the outcome of the case, any final resolution is unlikely to come before Mr. Obama leaves office early next year \u2014 timing that in some ways works for the president.\u201cTaking this case to the courts buys the administration a bit more time on these issues,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThis is a very challenging issue for the administration. There simply is no easy answer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThe response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets.Asked about Apple\u2019s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.The range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies\u2019 responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said.\u201cThe issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. \u201cThose companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it\u2019s not them in the spotlight.\u201dSome Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook\u2019s position on privacy.\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,\u201d Mr. Koum wrote. \u201cToday our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\u201dBut behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance.All of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201dThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201dPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.Apple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201dConor Dougherty and Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe in \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byPart of the challenge is balancing individuals\u2019 privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism.Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Sept. 11, 2001, Ms. Agrawal was a 22-year-old beginning a job in the investment banking division at Deutsche Bank at 130 Liberty Street, across the street from ground zero. On that morning she overslept. \u201cI had written down three things I wanted to do with the rest of my life after 9/11,\u201d Ms. Agrawal told me. She wanted to play professional soccer, work in film and start a business.She moved onto film, where she found herself undone by the yucky processed food laid out by craft services.

(Radha had gotten her period in the middle of the race.) The business did not develop until 2010. That was when Ms. Agrawal was on a trip to Johannesburg to attend the World Cup and met a girl who was forced to take a week off from school every month, when she was menstruating, because she had no access to feminine-hygiene supplies. It occurred to Ms. Agrawal, she said, that such hygiene \u201cwas a root cause of cyclical poverty in the developing world.\u201dAnother round of ads should be coming from her company shortly.

The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million.It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years.A.W.S., Google and Microsoft\u2019s Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there.Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries.Developers \u201ccan choose any cloud\u201d in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added \u201cyou\u2019ll see a deep integration with Azure,\u201d including features that won\u2019t be available in competing clouds.In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others.It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity.\u201cWe see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, \u201cevery enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers.\u201dThat idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used.\u201cThe customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,\u201d said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. \u201cThey all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Privacy Fight Tests Relationship With White House", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was relentless during a private meeting of tech giants and President Obama\u2019s top national security officials last month. Encrypted devices like the iPhone are here to stay, he insisted. Law enforcement needs to find a way to do its job in a new world.James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch pushed back, but Mr. Cook stood firm, several participants said.\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Mr. Cook told those around the table, including Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and the heads of the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cI think there has been a lack of leadership in the White House on this.\u201dDenis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, took exception and said so. Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.Either way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.Although the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.By refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.If Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.It is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.The exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.Four months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201dThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data. But if a disagreement happens, \u201cit\u2019s not bad for this policy conversation to happen transparently in a court proceeding.\u201dAt the same time, there was a growing alliance between this White House and Silicon Valley. Although other presidents have looked to the valley\u2019s innovators and venture capitalists for money, political support and ideas, this administration has wooed tech executives in far greater numbers. The president also has close ties to those in the industry who supported him early on, including Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn.Now, while Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are expected to file papers to the court in solidarity with Apple\u2019s encryption position, Mr. Cook stands relatively alone in his fight. This was evident at the meeting in January in Silicon Valley.As participants recalled it, Mr. Cook was the one who shifted the conversation to encryption \u2014 prompting nods of agreement from executives at Dropbox, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and others.Soon after, Mr. McDonough brought the meeting to an end. \u201cPut a pin in it,\u201d participants recalled that he said, making it clear that the conversation would continue.But one month later, the Justice Department moved against Apple.The White House Memo article on Saturday about a contentious standoff that pits President Obama against Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, over government efforts to force Apple to hack into a dead terrorist\u2019s iPhone misstated the nature of the Justice Department\u2019s move against Apple. Although it took legal action against the company, it did not sue.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Fights Order to Unlock San Bernardino Gunman\u2019s iPhone", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWhen the talks collapsed, a federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department\u2019s request, ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the phone. The order set off a furious public battle on Wednesday between the Obama administration and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies in a dispute with far-reaching legal implications.\u201cThis Apple case really goes right to the heart of the encryption issue,\u201d said Ira Rubinstein, a senior fellow at the New York University Information Law Institute, \u201cand in some ways, this was a fight that was inevitable.\u201dThis is not the first time a technology company has been ordered to effectively decrypt its own product. But industry experts say it is the most significant because of Apple\u2019s global profile, the invasive steps it says are being demanded and the brutality of the San Bernardino attacks.Law enforcement officials who support the F.B.I.\u2019s position said that the impasse with Apple provided an ideal test case to move from an abstract debate over the balance between national security and privacy to a concrete one.Mr. Tariche, who is president of the agents\u2019 association, added, \u201cAs more of these devices come to market, this touches all aspects of the cases that we\u2019re working on.\u201dMr. Cook, the chief executive at Apple, responded Wednesday morning with a blistering, 1,100-word letter to Apple customers, warning of the \u201cchilling\u201d breach of privacy posed by the government\u2019s demands. He maintained that the order would effectively require it to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to get around its own safeguards, and Apple vowed to appeal the ruling by next week.Officials have discovered a potential link between the attackers and Islamic extremism.Apple argues that the software the F.B.I. wants it to create does not exist. But technologists say the company can do it.Mr. Cook\u2019s angry tone reflected the tense discussions, conducted mostly on the telephone, between his company and the government\u2019s lawyers over the San Bernardino case. Apple executives had hoped to resolve the impasse without having to rewrite their own encryption software. They were frustrated that the Justice Department had aired its demand in public, according to an industry executive with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions.The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have the White House\u2019s \u201cfull support,\u201d the spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Wednesday.His vote of confidence was significant because James Comey, the F.B.I. director, has at times been at odds with the White House over his aggressive advocacy of tougher decryption requirements on technology companies. While Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team was sympathetic to Mr. Comey\u2019s position, others at the White House viewed legislation as potentially perilous. Late last year, Mr. Obama refused to back any legislation requiring decryption, leaving a court fight likely.The Justice Department showed no sign of backing down Wednesday.\u201cIt is unfortunate,\u201d the department said in a statement, \u201cthat Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil.\u201dThe dispute could initiate legislation in Congress, with Republicans and Democrats alike criticizing Apple\u2019s stance on Wednesday and calling for tougher decryption requirements. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential contender, also attacked Apple on Fox News, asking, \u201cWho do they think they are?\u201dBut Apple had many defenders of its own among privacy and consumer advocates, who praised Mr. Cook for standing up to what they saw as government overreach.Many of the company\u2019s defenders argued that the types of government surveillance operations exposed in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, have prompted technology companies to build tougher encryption safeguards in their products because of the privacy demands of their customers.\u201cApple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers,\u201d said Alex Abdo, staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberty Union\u2019s privacy and technology section.Privacy advocates and others said they worried that if the F.B.I. succeeded in getting access to the software overriding Apple\u2019s encryption, it would create easy access for the government in many future investigations.\u201cThis is not the last step in the journey,\u201d said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who works on privacy and tech security issues at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. \u201cThe next thing you know, they\u2019ll be in the back door of these systems.\u201dThe Apple order is a flash point in a dispute that has been building for more than a decade.The F.B.I. began sounding alarms years ago about technology that allowed people to exchange private messages protected by encryption so strong that government agents could not break it. In fall 2010, at the behest of Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, the Obama administration began work on a law that required technology companies to provide unencrypted data to the government.Lawyers at the F.B.I., Justice Department and Commerce Department drafted bills around the idea that technology companies in the Internet age should be bound by the same rules as phone companies, which were forced during the Clinton administration to build digital networks that government agents could tap.The draft legislation would have covered app developers like WhatsApp and large companies like Google and Apple, according to current and former officials involved in the process.There is no debate that, when armed with a court order, the government can get text messages and other data stored in plain text. Far less certain was whether the government could use a court order to force a company to write software or redesign its system to decode encrypted data. A federal law would make that authority clear, they said.But the disclosures of government surveillance by Mr. Snowden changed the privacy debate, and the Obama administration decided not to move on the proposed legislation. It has not been revived.The legal issues raised by the judge\u2019s order are complicated. They involve statutory interpretation, rather than constitutional rights, and they could end up before the Supreme Court.The law lets judges \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201dThe government says the law gives broad latitude to judges to require \u201cthird parties\u201d to execute court orders. It has cited a 1977 ruling requiring phone companies to help set up a pen register, a device that records all numbers called from a particular phone line.Apple argues that the scope of the act has strict limits. In 2005, a federal magistrate judge rejected the argument that the law could be used to compel a telecommunications provider to allow real-time tracking of a cellphone without a search warrant.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.

He said 77 percent of all active devices were using these most advanced and secure operating systems.Other social issues were also raised at the meeting. Mr. Cook said a pay study at the company had found that women earned 99.6 cents for every $1 that men did and that underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents for every $1 that white employees earned in similar roles.

{"Headline": "Apple and Dr. Dre Are Said to Be Planning an Original TV Show", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is working on an original television show with Dr. Dre, the co-founder of Beats Music and an Apple executive, according to a person with knowledge of the project.The show, currently titled \u201cVital Signs,\u201d will be an Apple Music project offered through Apple TV, the company\u2019s streaming video device, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the plans because they are private.Apple has been trying to make inroads into the living room, where viewers still watch tremendous amounts of content and advertisers still jockey for screen time. But the company trails competitors. The streaming device category is dominated by smart TVs, the Roku box and Google\u2019s Chromecast, data from the research firm eMarketer shows.\u201cThere has been such a proliferation of video streaming services and hardware in the past year that the only way Apple can get a leg up in the market is to differentiate with original content,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.But Apple has struggled with content, while companies like Netflix and Amazon already have award-winning original shows.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, has been trying to put together a bundle of television shows for Apple TV that would be smaller than what cable companies offer, said a person with knowledge of the plan who declined to be identified because the discussions are private. But television and cable companies have balked at a deal. Apple has also held talks with film and television executives about financing original programs to be offered exclusively through Apple TV.Creating a show with Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, would help Apple overcome some of its content difficulties. Dr. Dre joined Apple after it acquired his Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. In addition to working with Apple Music, he produced the 2015 film \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which is based on his musical career. The television show is Dr. Dre\u2019s project and Apple is backing it, one person said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the project, but noted that the last quarter of 2015 was the best for Apple TV sales.Apple Music recently signed its own content agreements, including a deal to stream a concert film from Taylor Swift\u2019s world tour.\u201cLike so many Apple products, Apple TV wants to be a self-sufficient ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Verna said. \u201cIf a company has to look within to find entertainment industry talent, thanks to Apple Music and the company\u2019s tremendous entertainment industry contacts, Apple is as well positioned as any company to do so.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Ben Sisario from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Faces U.S. Demand to Unlock 9 More iPhones", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department is demanding Apple\u2019s help in unlocking at least nine iPhones nationwide in addition to the phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.The disclosure appears to buttress the company\u2019s concerns that the dispute could pose a threat to encryption safeguards that goes well beyond the single California case.Apple is fighting the government\u2019s demands in at least seven of the other nine cases, Marc J. Zwillinger, a lawyer for the company, said in a letter unsealed in federal court on Tuesday.\u201cApple has not agreed to perform any services on the devices,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger wrote. Starting in December, the letter says, Apple has in a number of cases objected to the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to force its cooperation through a 1789 statute known as the All Writs Act, which says courts can require actions to comply with their orders.In the San Bernardino case, prosecutors have cast their demands for Apple to help them unlock the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook \u2014 one of the attackers in the December rampage, in which 14 people were killed \u2014 as a limited effort in response to an unusual situation.Still, \u201cno one should be surprised that we\u2019re investigating other cases and looking for assistance in those other cases,\u201d a law enforcement official said on Tuesday.Since challenging a judge\u2019s demand in the San Bernardino case, which called for Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone\u2019s passcode, the company has repeatedly asserted that such a move could not be done in isolation.Apple has long maintained that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it was technically able to do so. In a report covering the first six months of 2015, Apple said it had received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies worldwide for information on roughly 60,000 devices, and it provided some data in roughly 7,100 instances.But while the data backed up on Apple\u2019s iCloud service is readily accessible by the company, it has made the security on the iPhone itself increasingly hard to crack.Because a number of the newly disclosed cases remain sealed, Apple\u2019s letter did not describe the types of crimes at issue. But they appear to involve run-of-the-mill prosecutions for offenses like drug trafficking and pornography, rather than a high-profile terrorism investigation, officials said.The newly disclosed cases are in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston.The existence of the other demands came to light in a drug-trafficking case in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where prosecutors are seeking access to the data held in an iPhone linked to a methamphetamine distribution ring.The two sides are awaiting a ruling from Magistrate Judge James Orenstein on whether Apple should be forced to cooperate. Before issuing a ruling, Judge Orenstein wanted Apple to detail other pending requests from prosecutors.The Brooklyn drug-trafficking case has been dwarfed by the fight in California. But national security lawyers say the Brooklyn case remains important, because Judge Orenstein\u2019s decision is expected to be the first to offer a broad examination of the government\u2019s authority under the All Writs Act to force Apple to unlock passcode-protected iPhones.The judge has indicated skepticism over the government\u2019s demands. Initially, Apple agreed to a formal order to help the Justice Department gain access to Mr. Feng\u2019s phone, but Judge Orenstein balked, questioning whether the All Writs Act could be used that way. He invited Apple\u2019s lawyers to raise objections.While his ultimate decision will not be legally binding in California, it could influence the legal arguments there. And an appeal by either side has the potential to work its way through the federal court system to become significant case law.Law enforcement officials around the country are anxiously watching the cases in both Brooklyn and California to see how their own investigations might be affected.At a news conference last week after the debate erupted in California, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said they had collected about 175 iPhones, in investigations, that they have been unable to unlock.Mr. Vance rejected the notion that Apple should be forced to cooperate only in certain prominent crimes.\u201cWhat we discover is that investigation into one crime often leads into criminal activity in another, sometimes much more serious than what we were originally looking at,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Joseph Goldstein from New York. Al Baker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Today\u2019s smartphones hold a lot of personal data \u2014 your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow\u2019s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want \u2014 not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there\u2019s no longer any room for keeping secrets?\u201cThis case can\u2019t be a one-time deal,\u201d said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. \u201cThis is about the future.\u201d\u201cIf we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we\u2019re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, \u2018deviant\u2019 ideas \u2014 and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.\u201dMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.\u2019s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.\u201cBy and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that\u2019s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s \u2014 before email, before search engines, before social networks,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\u201cThe court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said. \u201cSo as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.\u201d\u201cWhat we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we\u2019re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,\u201d he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don\u2019t buy the Amazon Echo. Don\u2019t put cameras in your house. Don\u2019t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not.There\u2019s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.\u201cFrom a historical perspective, we\u2019re entering into a very new era,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. \u201cIn the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.\u201dBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.\u201cNow we have a surveillance-enabled world,\u201d Ms. Granick said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap, and it\u2019s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet, Google\u2019s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close In on Apple", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDespite spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that don\u2019t make much money, Alphabet\u2019s advertising business propelled the company to a strong last three months of 2015, outpacing expectations and sending the stock up in after-hours trading.Now, when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple, which has been the most valuable company in the world for nearly four years. Apple is still generating enviable profits but is dealing with concerns that its franchise iPhone business is slowing down.If investors are sending any sort of signal to big tech companies, which have taken their lumps from shareholders this year, it is simply this: You are free to spend on side projects so long as your main business is not showing signs of weakness.\u201cThe main thing is the core business,\u201d said Josh Spencer, who manages T. Rowe Price\u2019s Global Technology Fund.Alphabet\u2019s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014.The revenue rise was attributed to strong growth in mobile search and YouTube, which is significant because investors had long been looking for signs that the core search business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones, and that YouTube was becoming a driver of new growth.\u201cAbove all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google\u2019s range of businesses,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of the Google business, during the call.Net income was $4.9 billion versus $4.7 billion for the same period a year ago, beating Wall Street expectations. The company said its \u201cother bets\u201d category \u2014 the moonshots \u2014 had revenue of $448 million.Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google\u2019s core business is performing.In fact, many Alphabet investors are hoping that merely disclosing new information will give the stock price an extra lift. In a recent report, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, called segment reporting \u201cthe most identifiable near-term catalyst in Internet land,\u201d which is to say that when companies give investors more information, it makes them more eager to buy in.The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere.Mr. Spencer, of T. Rowe Price, which holds Alphabet shares, said he had been happy with Alphabet\u2019s progress but wanted the company to give back more of its cash pile to investors.\u201cI would like to see more developments in terms of capital return, but not this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBaby steps with this company.\u201dOf course, the reality is that, in revenue terms, nothing about Alphabet\u2019s business has changed. Google began 2015 as a giant advertising company connected to a collection of intriguing science projects. Alphabet ended the year as a collection of intriguing science projects connected to a highly profitable advertising business.Advertising continues to account for the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising.This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google\u2019s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\u201cFor a company of this size to continue to be able to grow at 20 percent a year \u2014 that\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.What about those other bets, like the self-driving car? Right now they are just big losses. For investors, then, this report was less about the future than it was about reassuring them that the old Google is continuing to grow quickly, and that other products like YouTube are going to pick up the growth when search advertising starts to mature.If one of the moonshots should work out, then great.

Cook.While these companies have said they would comply, when legally obliged to, with handing over information on their users, they say they believe that creating technological back doors to their digital systems can lead to potential abuse by governments worldwide.For Facebook, which has almost 1.6 billion global users, the encryption debate is only one of the growing number of policy hurdles that the company needs to overcome as it expands its global presence.Speaking on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company wanted to offer Internet connectivity to the developing world that did not have digital access and that Facebook would look for ways to continue doing that in India and beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to the mission that we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said about the recent decision in India that outlawed Free Basics. \u201cWhat works in one country may not work in another.\u201dDespite his attempts to downplay the setback, the recent decision by Indian regulators has put Facebook and its 31-year-old chief executive in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality.Internet giants like Facebook and Google can expect more scrutiny around the world as they continue to expand, said Pierre Louette, a deputy chief executive of Orange, the former French telecommunications monopoly. When confronted with this scrutiny, he added, tech companies may look to build bridges with traditional telecom operators that have faced similar regulatory challenges for decades.\u201cThey need more friends than before,\u201d said Mr. Louette, in reference to global tech companies.Advertisement"}

The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201dThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201dIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201dApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201dA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201dApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J.

It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \u2014 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed.Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\u2019s cooperation and its resistance is \u201ctechnically able.\u201dIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\u2019s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.That could include iCloud, if Apple can figure out a consumer-friendly way to keep the data under lock and key \u2014 a key Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to use \u2014 without making it inconvenient for people who need to retrieve backups.That is no simple feat. Apple would have to find a way to let users retrieve their own data safely even without the company\u2019s help, while keeping out hackers and other sorts of data thieves.None of this iCloud discussion would apply to iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary text messaging service. It uses technology called end-to-end encryption, which means messages sent using iMessage cannot be intercepted and decrypted. Only the sender and receiver, not Apple, have the keys to read such messages. Apple retains encrypted iMessages on its servers until they are read by the user or expire after several days.For now, the best bet to protect your personal information from snoops may be to keep it off iCloud \u2014 and the many, many apps that may pass or store unencrypted information through data centers. It is safer on your device.Just try not to drop your phone in a swimming pool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking iPhone Data, Through the Front Door", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHE government and Apple have chosen interesting ground on which to contest the limits of government access to data on mobile devices. The case involves an F.B.I. request for Apple\u2019s assistance in opening a phone once carried by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife was responsible for the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 wounded.On one level, this should be comfortable space for the government. First, the phone is owned by the County of San Bernardino, which issued it to Mr. Farook, an employee of its health department. The county, as Apple\u2019s customer, has no problem having its phone opened. Second, Mr. Farook and his wife were killed in a gun battle with the police early last December. Under the law, dead people have no privacy rights.But Apple is making a stand because the government wants it to create something against its will: code that would disable a feature that erases all content after 10 failed password attempts. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said that if this happens, the floodgates will open to similar law enforcement requests, putting customers\u2019 data at risk. And not just in the United States: Apple supporters have raised concerns that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are likely to follow suit.Mr. Cook\u2019s position is hyperbolic, in our view. But beyond the legal case, there is an ethics issue unfolding here.Until 17 months ago, Apple held the key that could override protections and open phones. Apple used this \u201cmaster key\u201d to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases. There was no documented instance of this code getting out to hackers or to the government. So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS 8, \u201cApple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants\u201d?Some believe that allegations by Edward J. Snowden of mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications by the National Security Agency stoked fears among Apple\u2019s customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn\u2019t unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.But Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans\u2019 Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple\u2019s position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.Apple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.Apple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to \u201ccreate a back door\u201d into people\u2019s devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.What the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014. Complying with constitutionally legal court orders is not \u201ccreating a back door\u201d; in a democracy, that is a front door.Mr. Cook says Apple\u2019s ultimate goal is to provide customers \u201csafety\u201d from \u201cattack.\u201d But Mr. Cook does not seem to be talking about the kind of attack that took 14 lives in San Bernardino. Presumably, he means attacks from hackers or what he may view as government intrusion \u2014 even when that intrusion is legal.The phone in the San Bernardino case stopped uploading data to the cloud about six weeks before the killings. That suggests there may be information inside the device that was deliberately concealed. That could include the identities of terrorists who influenced or directed the attack; such information, if pursued, could prevent future plots. Or the iPhone might contain nothing of value. It is Apple\u2019s position that we should never know.The ramifications of this fight extend beyond San Bernardino. Brittany Mills was a 29-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in Baton Rouge, La. Apple says it can\u2019t comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the police believe the identity of the killer is contained in her device.Ms. Mills was an Apple customer. So were some of the people who died with iPhones in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks. How is not solving a murder, or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attack, protecting anyone?Google, which owns the Android system, now indicates that it will follow Apple\u2019s lead. For those companies, and others like them, there is a sound argument in not wanting, even indirectly, to become an arm of the government. But when you are the two companies whose operating systems handle more than 90 percent of mobile communications worldwide, you should be accountable for more than just sales.William J. Bratton is the New York City police commissioner and John J. Miller is the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence.Advertisement"}

Homes and cars do not have unbreakable locks. You cannot buy an uncrackable safe. And terrorists and child molesters should not be able to buy a hand-held computer that keeps its secrets forever.Apple, backed by technologists and civil libertarians, says yes. People live their lives electronically; their phones are a record of loves and fantasies, illnesses and losses. Apple built its recent iPhones to keep that data private and says nothing less than the future of privacy is at stake in this fight.For months, the Justice Department and Apple have been trading heated rhetoric and lurching toward this very confrontation, only to back away. By the end of last year, it seemed that Apple and other technology companies had won the public relations battle.The attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, however, changed the government\u2019s calculation. Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two people suspected of killing 14 people, left behind an iPhone 5c \u2014 a locked one. The F.B.I. has not been able to get access to any data on it.For the administration, it was perhaps the perfect test case, one that put Apple on the side of keeping secrets for a terrorist.Mr. Farook\u2019s phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep. It is encrypted with an algorithm the company says it cannot break. The F.B.I. wants to write a computer program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.But Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.\u2019s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.There is little middle ground between the positions of the Justice Department and Apple, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, did not back down. He issued a sharply worded statement on Wednesday, saying he planned to fight the order. He said the Obama administration was not only creating a dangerous precedent but was demanding the creation of a dangerous tool \u2014 a skeleton key that could be used by hackers and totalitarian governments.\u201cOnce the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Government vs. Apple, Who Wears the Black Hat?", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHE dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over access to the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen in the San Bernardino massacre, comes down to this question: Shouldn\u2019t the government have more legal and moral authority to weigh complicated issues of privacy and national security than a company that makes phones?It should. After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security.The government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn\u2019t done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly.In one project, revealed in October 2013 by journalists tipped off by Edward Snowden, the N.S.A., along with its British counterpart, essentially hacked into fiber-optic cables that connected the data centers of Google and Yahoo outside the United States. Under American law, the agency already had access to some of the information, but it tapped the lines anyway.Silicon Valley companies love to celebrate the hacker spirit, but they don\u2019t like being on the receiving end. By November 2013, both Google and Yahoo announced that they were encrypting data traveling between its server centers. By the following September, Apple announced that its new phones would by default encrypt data stored on the device in such a way that even the company itself couldn\u2019t get at it.At the time, this seemed like a hopelessly geeky version of Mad magazine\u2019s \u201cSpy vs. Spy,\u201d with opponents one-upped with algorithms rather than cartoon bombs. But the fight led directly to Tuesday\u2019s ruling by a federal magistrate judge in California that Apple must help the F.B.I. unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. The laws governing online privacy are woefully out-of-date. To compel Apple to help execute a warrant, the judge cited the All Writs Act of 1789, enacted before there was electricity.In Apple\u2019s public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.\u2019s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones.By analogy, the company doesn\u2019t have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It\u2019s hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple\u2019s phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death.The United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora\u2019s box that can\u2019t be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions.What we really need is a robust public conversation around strong privacy laws that would apply to the government and private companies alike and clear limits on what should be done with data. Important choices about the future of technology and privacy should be made by the American people and their representatives, not by Silicon Valley, where even the noblest intentions are mixed with huge financial stakes. If the government wants the power to compel companies to undermine their own security systems, it should go to Congress and ask for it.Until then, we are left with Silicon Valley executives making engineering decisions that could determine what information the government can and can\u2019t have. That\u2019s both bad policy and fundamentally undemocratic.But the current choice is between a government that doesn\u2019t seem to recognize limits to its own power to access personal information and a technology company that does. It\u2019s a bad choice, but an obvious one. While nobody elected Mr. Cook to protect our privacy, we should be glad someone is.Robert Levine is the author of \u201cFree Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Apple, a Search for a Moral High Ground in a Heated Debate", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byDealBookWhat does it mean to be a good corporate citizen?That\u2019s one of the questions being tested as Apple and the federal government battle over whether Apple should help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone to gain access to encrypted data that officials say is necessary for their investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings that killed 14 people.Apple initially assisted the F.B.I., but is now fighting a government order directing it to create a new piece of software to open the phone, contending that its position is meant to protect the privacy of its customers.Aside from the thicket of legal issues raised by the case, does Apple have a moral obligation to help the government learn more about the attack? Or does it have a moral obligation to protect its customers\u2019 privacy? Or how about its shareholders? And which of these should take precedence?Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has long spoken about running his company based on certain values. He has used his position to advocate gay rights, for example, and pushed the company to be more \u201cgreen,\u201d once going so far as to tell a shareholder who questioned the return on investment of taking such stances, \u201cIf you want me to do things only for R.O.I. reasons, you should get out of this stock.\u201dDuring a graduation speech last year at George Washington University, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe believe that a company that has values and acts on them can really change the world.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is opportunity to do work that is infused with moral purpose.\u201dMr. Cook has argued that complying with the court order would threaten \u201ceveryone\u2019s civil liberties\u201d and make customers more vulnerable to digital crime. And Mr. Cook is not alone. Chiefs at several technology companies have supported his position. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic with Apple on this one,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., said on stage Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Apple has come under sharp criticism from law enforcement officials. \u201cThere was once such a thing called corporate responsibility,\u201d William J. Bratton, the police commissioner of New York City, said of Apple. \u201cNow, it\u2019s corporate irresponsibility.\u201dThe debate over Apple\u2019s stance is just the latest in a series of questions about corporate patriotism. In recent years, questions have been directed at companies that renounce their United States citizenship to move to a country with a lower tax rate. Others, including Apple, have faced questions about tax strategies to shelter income abroad. And companies\u2019 social responsibility programs, say for clean energy or water efficiency, have been scrutinized.Behind Mr. Cook\u2019s worry is a separate, perhaps even more immediate threat: the possibility that if Apple were to comply with the court\u2019s order, other governments might follow suit and require Apple to give them access for their own investigative purposes. If Apple refused the request of, say, the Chinese government, it would risk being barred from doing business in China, its second-largest market after the United States.And then there\u2019s the possibility that if Apple were to build special software for the F.B.I., it could fall into the wrong hands, leading to even greater privacy and safety concerns.All of which leads back to the same question: At what point is there a moral obligation for a company to help law enforcement, regardless of the business or privacy risk, in the event of a terrorist attack, or any crime?\u201cWhat are we really doing here? We\u2019re protecting a terrorist,\u201d Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney, told Bloomberg News, referring to Apple\u2019s position. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around that.\u201dAs principled as Mr. Cook\u2019s position may be, it still has the effect of hindering (or at least not helping) a criminal investigation that his company is uniquely situated to assist. (It is worth noting that the government already has most of the material on the phone from a previous backup.)Some business economists like Milton Friedman would most likely argue that Apple has no moral obligation to the government that isn\u2019t in the interest of maximizing its profits.The Justice Department has suggested Apple\u2019s position \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201dJames Comey, the director of the F.B.I., says that this lawsuit presents a narrow legal issue, and that what the government seeks is limited to this particular case.\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation isn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201dYet other law enforcement officials suggest that the conflict with Apple extends far beyond the San Bernardino case.\u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West of technology,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said last Thursday, citing at least 175 iPhones that his office cannot gain access to, and arguing that it should be able to do so. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201dUltimately, it appears that both sides have left little room for compromise. \u201cTim Cook and lawyer Ted Olson have draped their argument in one of moral absolutism \u2014 but there is a hierarchy of moral reasoning they miss,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, referring to Apple\u2019s outside lawyer, Mr. Olson.But if this broader controversy is ever going to be solved for the long term, there has to be an opportunity to reach a consensus in the middle.Maybe that means Apple should work with law enforcement to train officials so they have a better ability to rapidly retrieve information legally? (After all, law enforcement had a chance to gain access to the iPhone in question had they taken certain steps early on.) Or maybe the president should create a commission to study the issue, bringing together people from Silicon Valley and law enforcement to create agreed-upon rules of the road. Or, perhaps new legislation is required.Mr. Comey, in a statement issued Sunday night, suggested as much, citing the need to resolve the \u201ctension between two values we all treasure \u2014 privacy and safety.\u201d\u201cThat tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also should not be resolved by the F.B.I., which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The building, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street, dates to the late 1800s and for years was the flagship of the Kaufmann\u2019s department store chain. It went through several expansions and renovations, including a heralded Art Deco interior makeover of the first floor in 1930.Randy Mineo, executive vice president of Core Realty and a Pittsburgh native, envisions a mix of retailers, restaurants and entertainment spots to complement a 155-room Even Hotel and 312 luxury apartments. Named the Grand at Fifth Avenue, the estimated $100 million project will feature an open-air atrium beginning on the fifth floor and 600 parking spaces, a sparse commodity downtown.\u201cI\u2019ve always looked at Pittsburgh as a hidden gem; it\u2019s a city that has been kind of ignored,\u201d said Mr. Mineo, who with the owner of Core Realty, Michael Samschick, began hunting for properties in the city three years ago. \u201cBut you could tell that underneath the surface, Pittsburgh was bubbling.\u201dDevelopers, corporations, educators and others have pumped about $5 billion into the city\u2019s downtown, also called the Golden Triangle, over the last decade, according to the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.Investors have converted old office buildings into residential units, hotels and classrooms, constructed new office buildings, and built up the district\u2019s restaurant and entertainment base, even while the state has overseen the city\u2019s budget as a result of Pittsburgh\u2019s near-bankruptcy early this century.Among other projects, Millcraft Investments, a developer based in nearby Washington, Pa., which evolved from the industrialist Jack B. Piatt\u2019s business interests, converted seven historic buildings in 2010 into Market Square Place, a $42 million project that houses a Y.M.C.A., retailers and 46 loft apartments.And Millcraft is putting the final touches on its newly constructed $108 million Gardens at Market Square, a mixed-use development that offers a 197-room Hilton Garden Inn, office and retail space, and a garage for 330 cars.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much activity in Pittsburgh,\u201d said Lucas B. Piatt, president and chief operating officer of Millcraft. \u201cIt\u2019s not down on itself anymore.\u201dAbout five years ago, national office investors for the first time took notice of the market after vacancies actually fell and rental rates grew amid the financial turbulence in 2008 and 2009, said Jason T. Stewart, an executive vice president with the brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle in Pittsburgh.That was, in part, because of fortunate circumstances, Mr. Stewart said. The regulator-encouraged acquisition by PNC of the beleaguered National City Mortgage, as well as the merger between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, brought thousands of workers downtown.\u201cAfter the dust settled in 2010, the fundamentals in Pittsburgh looked very favorable,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in 2011, office trades started happening.\u201dClass A office space downtown now has an average vacancy rate of about 7.5 percent, although rental rates remained relatively flat in 2015 and coming lease expirations will put more space in older buildings on the market, according to Jones Lang.Nevertheless, building conversions have cut into office supply and little new construction is underway or planned, which is fostering an environment for rent increases, said Dan Adamski, a managing director with the brokerage.Shorenstein, an office landlord based in San Francisco, made its first acquisition in Pittsburgh last month, paying $149 million for the 45-story One Oxford Centre. It plans to update the property, which is about 20 percent vacant.\u201cIn downtown Pittsburgh, 20 percent vacancy is considered high,\u201d said Matthew M. Knisely, a managing director with Shorenstein. \u201cMost Class A towers are very well leased, and we expect the same thing at One Oxford Centre.\u201dIn addition to the promising office market conditions, the decisions of Google, Uber, Apple and Oculus, owned by Facebook, to put operations in Pittsburgh grabbed Shorenstein\u2019s attention, as did the tech start-ups emerging from nearby Carnegie Mellon University, he said. Much of that activity stems from the city\u2019s longstanding strategy to build up its academic, medical and technological base.The growing population in the downtown area \u2014 up 10 percent to more than 12,300 residents since 2010 \u2014 also appealed to Shorenstein. The housing supply in the downtown area has ballooned nearly 50 percent to more than 5,300 units since 2000, and the average occupancy is about 95 percent, according to estimates by the downtown partnership group. An additional 3,875 units are under construction or planned.Conversation among developers and civic leaders is increasingly focusing on how to improve the Golden Triangle\u2019s shopping experience and whether the area population alone can support conventional retailers. Mr. Piatt, for example, doubts that suburbanites will trek downtown to frequent stores already situated close to home.Restaurants, entertainment venues and boutiques have replaced four department stores as the Golden Triangle\u2019s retail anchors, said Herky Pollock, executive vice president and northeast director of the retail services group for the brokerage company CBRE in the city. But he suggested that the bustling restaurant scene and the growing number of young workers living downtown was generating interest among a variety of operators, from discount retailers like T. J. Maxx to large fitness facilities.\u201cAs long as we add unique offerings, downtown will prosper beyond where it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Pollock said.Still, Macy\u2019s closing in September left a gaping hole along Smithfield Street, once the city\u2019s most vibrant retail corridor, and has put Core Realty\u2019s redevelopment plan under a microscope. Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., president of the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, wants to see retailing dominate Smithfield Street again.His organization led opposition to the plan by a former mayor, Thomas J. Murphy Jr., to replace 64 buildings on 4.5 acres with a mall in the 1990s. In addition to initiatives like protecting old building facades, the foundation has renovated a handful of properties to create space for apartments, clothing stores, a grocer and other shops, generally charging rental rates below the market average.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned whether people will live downtown if they have to leave downtown to shop,\u201d Mr. Ziegler said. \u201cThe Macy\u2019s project is going to be very important. We need it full of shops or that street won\u2019t come back for retail.\u201dMacy\u2019s initially wanted to take part in the renovation and stay on four floors but couldn\u2019t make it work financially, Mr. Mineo said. Instead, he is planning 100,000 square feet of shops, restaurants and entertainment on the first two floors, as well as a rooftop restaurant.The inability to substantially increase the number of entrances into the landmark will require Core Realty to woo larger users, however, and junior apparel stores, supermarkets and entertainment concepts like Lucky Strike bowling are among his targets.\u201cWe need people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that with all the apartments that are here and those that are coming, we\u2019ll have enough to support the project.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "SiriusXM Fights to Dominate the Dashboard of the Connected Car", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byOn the 36th floor of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, the actors Ice Cube and Kevin Hart joshed with fans inside a glass-walled radio studio one afternoon last month. They were in the broadcast headquarters of SiriusXM, and across the lobby, near Howard Stern\u2019s dedicated wing, Brooke Shields posed for selfies with three \u201cSesame Street\u201d puppets, while Senator Rand Paul \u2014 at that point, still a candidate for president \u2014 hovered with a small entourage. Overhead, a screen announced the imminent arrival of the thrash-metal band Anthrax.By any measure, it was an odd cross section of pop culture. Surveying the scene, Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM\u2019s chief content officer, smiled and declared, \u201cThis is how I like it \u2014 just this diverse.\u201dAt SiriusXM, the satellite-radio network, executives use terms like \u201cmosaic,\u201d \u201cbundle\u201d and, inevitably, \u201ccurated\u201d to describe the company\u2019s mix of programming. With more than 175 channels, SiriusXM has much more variety than typical AM/FM radio but a small fraction of the ads. It has channels dedicated to the Grateful Dead and the Metropolitan Opera; five feeds of thumping electronic dance music; every pro baseball, football and basketball game; and, of course, Mr. Stern\u2019s blend of raunchy humor and celebrity interviews. Around the Super Bowl, it had 162 hours of live programming related to the game that ran across 22 shows on 10 channels.Once flirting with bankruptcy, SiriusXM has quietly become a financial powerhouse at a time when other radio and digital music outlets are struggling to make a profit, and also as the behavior of so-called cord cutters \u2014 who cancel their cable TV subscriptions to pick and choose their entertainment online (and to save money) \u2014 has made Wall Street nervous about the future of bundled media. SiriusXM last year earned $510 million on $4.6 billion in revenue, and renewed major deals with Mr. Stern and the National Football League.\u201cThis has been a remarkable success story against huge odds,\u201d said Barton Crockett, a media analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cMost of the investing public thought there was no way this would work, spending huge amounts of capital to launch satellites and put equipment in cars. But they were right. This is a great business.\u201dSiriusXM has hit on the formula for getting people \u2014 nearly 30 million of them \u2014 to pay for radio, a form of media that has always been free. But while the company likes to emphasize the awesomeness of its audio \u201cmosaics,\u201d there is another, more mundane, explanation for its success: cars.SiriusXM pays about $1 billion a year in subsidies and revenue splits to automakers, and according to the company, 75 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States come with satellite radio installed. (It works with every major carmaker.) Of the 29.6 million subscribers to SiriusXM at the end of last year, 24.2 million paid the $11 to $20 monthly fee themselves, with the rest covered through promotions by car companies.\u201cIf I ask myself two questions every day,\u201d James E. Meyer, SiriusXM\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview, \u201cthe first one is, \u2018What do I got to do to make sure people pay us $15?\u2019 The second one: \u2018What do I need to do to make sure that my position with the auto companies remains strong?\u2019\u201dYet cars are changing in ways that could threaten SiriusXM\u2019s position. New technologies, loosely referred to as the connected car, are bringing the Internet to the dashboard. For drivers, that means that various new audio apps \u2014 many of them free \u2014 will soon be available at a touch. For SiriusXM, that means a lot of new competition in the car, the place where consumers listen to radio the most. This process has already begun, with Apple and Google pushing for their own car media platforms, and Mr. Meyer said that he expected the technology to be in most new cars by the end of this decade. Will listeners still fork over $15 for SiriusXM if they can just as easily tune in to Spotify, Pandora or Beats 1 from Apple?\u201cThe major enemy of SiriusXM these days is Internet radio,\u201d said Jack Nerad, executive editorial director of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Sirius to be in automobiles, but I think that for the car companies, it\u2019s going to be just another programming source.\u201dMr. Meyer, who spent years managing the company\u2019s relationships with Detroit before he became chief executive in 2012, has been hearing this refrain for a long time. But he said that SiriusXM was well positioned for the change, with plans for a new, more interactive version of its radio system, code-named SXM17, and the advantage of knowing that car companies make changes to their machines very slowly. \u201cEven when you\u2019re Apple,\u201d Mr. Meyer said, \u201cthey will still live with the speed carmakers want to go.\u201dPhil Abram, the chief infotainment officer of General Motors, said that Pandora, as well as platforms like Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto, have had no significant effect on how many of its customers subscribe to SiriusXM.\u201cPeople like to have a plethora of content,\u201d Mr. Abram said. \u201cOne day you might want to listen to music on your iPhone, the next day talk radio, and the next day you want a curated set of music from a company like SiriusXM. We want to try to make it as easy as possible for our customers to enjoy whichever they want.\u201dSatellite radio\u2019s fortunes have not always been so rosy. After years of planning and investment in the 1990s, the new medium began broadcasting in the early 2000s from two companies, Sirius and XM. For years both lost money as they competed to build their programming slates and sign multimillion-dollar deals with celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart.Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty\u2019s chief executive and the chairman of SiriusXM, recalled that at the time of the deal, a colleague told him, \u201cEither the world ends, or we\u2019re going to make a lot of money.\u201d They made a lot of money. SiriusXM repaid the loans in five months, and the roughly 62 percent stake that Liberty now has in the company \u2014 which is formally known as Sirius XM Holdings \u2014 is worth about $11 billion. SiriusXM\u2019s strategy for competing with free radio has been to give people a lot of the radio they like \u2014 music, sports, talk, news \u2014 and minimize what they do not, namely commercials. That means the station\u2019s programmers do not feel the ratings pressures that bedevil terrestrial radio.\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have ratings,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said, \u201cyou can be very open-minded about your belief in what might be a hit.\u201dAnother success story is \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good,\u201d an ode to monogamy by the clean-cut singer Andy Grammer that came out in late 2014. Steve Greenberg, the president of Mr. Grammer\u2019s label, S-Curve, believed the song had hit potential but was too quirky for terrestrial radio. So he pitched it to Kid Kelly, a SiriusXM programmer, who put the song into heavy rotation on Hits 1, the network\u2019s pop station.The song caught on and was soon selling 30,000 copies a week, almost entirely because of SiriusXM\u2019s exposure. But in the music business nothing happens in a vacuum, and after a few months, AM/FM stations began playing it, too. The song eventually sold about 2.5 million copies, making it one of the biggest hits of 2015.The success of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good\u201d underscores a fact that is often forgotten in the age of Spotify and YouTube: Radio remains popular and influential \u2014 according to Nielsen, 93 percent of adults tune in at least once a week \u2014 and music executives say that blanketing stations everywhere is still the most effective way to secure a hit.\u201cThere is absolutely no chance in the world that this record could have launched without the backing of Hits 1,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good.\u201d \u201cAnd there is no way it could have gone Top 10 without the backing of terrestrial radio.\u201dIf the connected car is a challenge looming in SiriusXM\u2019s future, the biggest threat in its recent past was the potential loss of Mr. Stern, perhaps the network\u2019s only indispensable star \u2014 \u201cthe heart and soul of SiriusXM,\u201d as Mr. Greenstein put it.Mr. Stern\u2019s contract was expiring at the end of last year, and speculation began to spread that he might abandon satellite radio for yet another media frontier. Don Buchwald, Mr. Stern\u2019s agent for more than 30 years, said that he met with dozens of companies, all promising to be an exciting new home for the show. Mr. Stern himself sometimes grumbled on and off the air about whether, at age 62, it was time to retire. Longtime fans have heard this one before, but Mr. Buchwald said it was genuine.\u201cPeople think it\u2019s a negotiating ploy, but I can tell you there is reality to it,\u201d said Mr. Buchwald, whose Manhattan office contains decades\u2019 worth of Howard Stern memorabilia, including an enormous cardboard theater stand for the 1997 movie \u201cPrivate Parts,\u201d released not long after Mr. Stern started calling himself \u201cking of all media.\u201d\u201cHe loved when he did the movie, he loved when he published the books, he loved the TV shows,\u201d Mr. Buchwald continued, \u201cand he\u2019s thinking, \u2018Why am I getting up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and doing the same drivel?\u2019\u201dAdding to the uncertainty about the negotiations was the fact that Mr. Buchwald was unfamiliar with Mr. Meyer, who commutes to New York each week from Indianapolis and has spent his entire career in operations \u2014 \u201cAll I ever wanted to be was a plant manager,\u201d he said \u2014 far away from the world of show business. (He took over from Mel Karmazin, who had a decades-long relationship with Mr. Stern but left SiriusXM in 2012 after battling publicly with Liberty over its plans to take over majority control.)Neither SiriusXM nor Mr. Buchwald would comment on the specific terms of the deal, but analysts say it could be worth $90 million a year, including salaries and production expenses for Mr. Stern\u2019s team.Mr. Meyer, whose New York office is mostly bare except for some landscape photos and jerseys of Indianapolis sports teams, was obviously pleased to have renewed Mr. Stern\u2019s contract, which both he and Mr. Buchwald called a particularly complex deal to negotiate.But Mr. Meyer was also proud of the broader programming surrounding Mr. Stern. He listens to SiriusXM\u2019s classic rock and outlaw country channels, he said, and hardly ever listens to terrestrial radio.\u201cToo many commercials,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Tells Apple to Help Unlock iPhone Used by San Bernardino Gunman", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A judge in California on Tuesday ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December.The ruling handed the F.B.I. a potentially important victory in its long-running battle with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies over the government\u2019s ability to get access to encrypted data in investigations. Apple has maintained that requiring it to provide the \u201ckeys\u201d to its technology would compromise the security of the information of hundreds of millions of users.Prosecutors said in a court filing that Apple had the \u201cexclusive\u201d means to bypass the security features on the phone, but that the company had \u201cdeclined to provide that assistance voluntarily.\u201d F.B.I. experts say that because of the phone\u2019s security features, they risk losing the data permanently after 10 failed attempts to enter the password.The Justice Department had secured a search warrant for the phone, which is owned by Mr. Farook\u2019s former employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. But prosecutors said they saw little choice but to seek the additional order compelling Apple\u2019s assistance.Officials have discovered a potential link between the attackers and Islamic extremism.In an unusually detailed directive, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the District of Central California ordered Apple to provide \u201creasonable technical assistance\u201d to the F.B.I. in unlocking the phone. That assistance should allow investigators to \u201cbypass or erase the auto-erase function\u201d on the phone, among other steps, she wrote.Prosecutors said the contents of the phone could provide crucial evidence about the attackers\u2019 communications and contacts before the shooting.The husband and wife appear to have been motivated by a devotion to violent jihad, but the authorities have not connected them publicly to any extremists overseas. Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor, has been charged with providing them with the assault weapons used in the attack and conspiring with Mr. Farook in an earlier plot that was not carried out.Eileen M. Decker, the United States attorney in Los Angeles, where the investigation is being handled, said the effort to compel Apple\u2019s technical cooperation marked \u201canother step \u2014 a potentially important step \u2014 in the process of learning everything we possibly can about the attack in San Bernardino.\u201dA vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.Prosecutors \u201chave made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible,\u201d Ms. Decker said.James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, has been at odds with Apple and other technology companies for months over whether they should provide de-encryption technology for their products. Without it, he has argued, the bureau is at risk of \u201cgoing dark\u201d in its investigations. The Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and most of the Republican hopefuls support Mr. Comey\u2019s stance.Apple and other technology companies say that creating an opening in their products for government investigators would also create a vulnerability that Chinese, Iranian, Russian or North Korean hackers could exploit.Apple, arguing in December against a British proposal that could force it to provide the government with a way into iPhone communications, said the dispute should not be seen \u201cas an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement.\u201d\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Apple argued. \u201cLaw enforcement today has access to more data \u2014 data which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justice \u2014 than ever before in the history of our world.\u201dApple said that \u201cwe believe it would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike Have a Big Story (Apple), and Some Scraps", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byBitsI\u2019m curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple\u2019s side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.Here\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.Kanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.That\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.And that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.That\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.Or maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Sees Value in Its Stand to Protect Security", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byToday, China is Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States \u2014 Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year \u2014 and the iPhone, the company\u2019s top seller, has become both a status symbol and a form of personal security, given how difficult the device is to break into in a country where people increasingly worry about hacking and cybercrime.The company is playing the long game with its business. Privacy and security have become part of its brand, especially internationally, where it reaps almost two-thirds of its almost $234 billion a year in sales. And if it cooperates with one government, the thinking goes, it will have to cooperate with all of them.\u201cTim Cook is leveraging his personal brand and Apple\u2019s to stand on the side of consumer privacy in this environment,\u201d said Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who studies encryption and cyberlaw. \u201cHe is taking the long view.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks in Mr. Cook\u2019s letter.Apple senior executives responded that their defiance was not a business choice. They said there had not been any business fallout and that Mr. Cook had received supportive emails from customers across the country.In fact, Apple has not made a point of advertising data security and privacy. The company has quietly built privacy features into its mobile operating system, known as iOS, over time. By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones. And iOS8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.Mr. Cook has also been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about government surveillance. Mr. Cook argued that the company sold hardware \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses.For Apple, cooperating with the United States government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally.In China, for example, Apple \u2014 like any other foreign company selling smartphones \u2014 hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China.If Apple accedes to American law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China\u2019s use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties.Analysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups.\u201cPeople tend to forget the global impact of this,\u201d said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. \u201cThe reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It\u2019s even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms.\u201dGovernments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad.Apple\u2019s resistance to the United States government\u2019s demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,\u201d said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide on Tuesday to support Apple. \u201cApple is doing what every company should be doing.\u201dAround the world, people are aware of the impasse but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company\u2019s other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t see why\u201d the company\u2019s standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cwould change my mind about buying a new phone.\u201dIn China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status.Wen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who on Friday was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing\u2019s upscale Sanlitun district, is one of Apple\u2019s millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei.\u201cI\u2019ve never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple\u2019s socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company\u2019s core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders\u2019 meeting, Mr. Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, \u201cthen you should get out of the stock.\u201dBut data privacy may eventually motivate investors \u2014 and ultimately more customers \u2014 to vote with their wallets because \u201cit\u2019s an issue that speaks directly to the business,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the M.I.T.

If Apple is required to help the F.B.I. in this case, courts could require it to use this software in future investigations or order it to create new software to fit new needs. It is also theoretically possible that hackers could steal the software from the company\u2019s servers.-Even if the government prevails in forcing Apple to help, that will hardly be the end of the story. Experts widely believe that technology companies will eventually build devices that cannot be unlocked by company engineers and programmers without the permission of users. Newer smartphones already have much stronger security features than the iPhone 5c Mr. Farook used.Congress would do great harm by requiring such back doors. Criminals and domestic and foreign intelligence agencies could exploit such features to conduct mass surveillance and steal national and trade secrets. There\u2019s a very good chance that such a law, intended to ease the job of law enforcement, would make private citizens, businesses and the government itself far less secure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vanguard, a Champion of Low Fees, Faces a Peculiar Tax Challenge", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byStrategiesVanguard may have committed a sin while pursuing a virtue.Its virtue \u2014 providing simple, diversified investments at very low cost \u2014 is well known. Its sin \u2014 if that\u2019s what it deserves to be called \u2014 involves obscure details of tax accounting and corporate structure. It\u2019s not easy stuff.First, consider Vanguard\u2019s virtues. Since John C. Bogle founded it in 1975, Vanguard has relentlessly cut costs for fund shareholders, offering simple index funds and \u201cat cost\u201d operations that have been a boon to millions of people, in the view of many academics and investment analysts. It did this with the help of an unusual corporate structure, which is at the root of the whistle-blower\u2019s tax complaint.Mutual fund shareholders, not a separate profit-making entity, are the ultimate owners of the Vanguard Group, which provides services to the individual funds, an arrangement approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cVanguard was designed to eliminate conflicts of interest,\u201d said Tamar Frankel, a professor of law at Boston University. \u201cThat structure was also one of the ways in which Jack Bogle reduced the cost for investors, and it\u2019s been an absolutely great thing.\u201dThat\u2019s the easy part of this story. The harder part is the claim that while providing at-cost services, Vanguard may have run afoul of some I.R.S. rules. That is what David Danon, a former Vanguard tax lawyer, says in whistle-blower claims against Vanguard filed with the I.R.S. and other authorities. The I.R.S. won\u2019t comment on the claims, and John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, said, \u201cVanguard believes they are without merit.\u201dMr. Danon and Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, a University of Michigan law professor who has served as Mr. Danon\u2019s paid expert, have some intriguing arguments, if you are partial to this sort of thing. The issue is technical, so bear with me: Mr. Danon says that because the Vanguard Group was set up as a \u201cC corporation,\u201d and not a partnership, it has potential tax liabilities, even if it does not actually earn a profit. And because it is owned by its mutual funds, for tax purposes, he says, it is required to account for the profits that it could have earned if it had charged the higher fees that the marketplace would have borne.This may sound like a through-the-looking-glass sort of world, where a company will be punished if it spares investors exorbitant fees, but it could conceivably be the world in which we actually live.\u201cThis is a classic transfer-pricing issue,\u201d Professor Avi-Yonah says. \u201cThe law is very clear.\u201dOn technical grounds, the I.R.S. \u201ccould surely win in court\u201d if it applied transfer-pricing rules in the Vanguard case, Professor Avi-Yonah said.Not everyone is sure of that, though. David M. Schizer, a professor and dean emeritus at Columbia Law School, put the matter succinctly. \u201cThe transfer-pricing rules are intended to capture economic reality and not distort it,\u201d he said, adding that they weren\u2019t intended to apply in a situation like this and result in taxes when no profit existed. \u201cI think it would be absurd to force Vanguard to pay taxes in this case,\u201d he said. And John D. Morley, a Yale law professor who is an expert on mutual fund structure, said, \u201cI consider this litigation a little silly.\u201dTransfer-pricing rules are meant for situations in which a company controls a subsidiary and can use that control to set artificially low prices, thus concealing profits. That\u2019s not true here, Professor Morley said. \u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d he said, \u201call mutual funds are completely dominated by their manager. While Vanguard shareholders ultimately own the Vanguard Group, they don\u2019t really control it,\u201d he said. Vanguard charges low fees \u201csimply because that\u2019s the culture of Vanguard, as Jack Bogle created it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unique situation.\u201dEven Professor Avi-Yonah acknowledged in an interview that applying transfer-pricing rules in the case of Vanguard \u201cseems startling.\u201d In fact, he said he wasn\u2019t sure that the I.R.S. should enforce the rules in this fashion. \u201cLuckily, I don\u2019t have to make this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cGod knows the I.R.S. has enormous discretion in these cases.\u201d The agency \u201ccould accept the taxpayer\u2019s argument that it was an innocent mistake,\u201d he continued, even if \u201cit involves an enormous amount of tax revenue.\u201dMr. Danon asserts that Vanguard could owe billions of dollars in taxes on the putative, uncollected revenue. \u201cI know that this is a very unpopular position, and that many, many people are shareholders of Vanguard funds,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut the law is the law. Like everybody else, Vanguard should pay the taxes it owes. If it doesn\u2019t, somebody else has to make up the difference, and that\u2019s just not fair.\u201dOthers have looked closely at the possible amounts involved. I\u2019ll return to the numbers shortly. But first, some conflict-of-interest disclosures: Professor Avi-Yonah has an obvious conflict. He says he received $10,000 to $50,000 from Mr. Danon for his research and legal opinion. But he also says that the money has not influenced his views and notes that he will collect nothing further if Mr. Danon\u2019s position prevails.Mr. Danon has a conflict: Now unemployed, he could receive a whistle-blower\u2019s bonus of up to 30 percent of any funds collected by the I.R.S. in the claim. But he says he is fighting for a principle: \u201cI felt I had to become a whistle-blower because I believe I\u2019m right, and the law is the law, and I couldn\u2019t convince anyone at Vanguard about it.\u201dI have a conflict, too. Vanguard manages the retirement account at my workplace, as it does in many companies and institutions, and so I am a Vanguard shareholder. That\u2019s also true of several experts I contacted.Federal and state authorities have been considering these arguments. While the I.R.S. claim is pending, a New York judge dismissed Mr. Danon\u2019s suit in November, and Eric Soufer, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said on Wednesday that his office reviewed the case and has decided not to pursue it. Authorities in California declined to comment on a complaint filed by Mr. Danon there. He also has a claim with the S.E.C., which declined to comment.Mr. Danon has won one battle, however. The Texas comptroller of public accounts awarded him $117,000 for his role as a whistle-blower, said Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the agency. Reliable sources said Vanguard settled with the state for roughly $2 million, though the precise reasons for the settlement are not clear. Mr. Woerth of Vanguard wouldn\u2019t confirm the amount of the payment, and said it was merely the \u201cresult of a routine audit.\u201d It is possible that it arose from a relatively small part of Mr. Danon\u2019s complaint \u2014 questions he has raised about the accounting for a $1.5 billion contingency fund that Vanguard maintains.Even if the I.R.S. finds Vanguard liable on all counts, the consequences are unlikely to be significant, says Daniel Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago (who, like me, is a Vanguard shareholder). He says that, with penalties, a Vanguard settlement with federal and state authorities could raise average annual mutual fund shareholder fees by no more than 0.09 percentage point, and probably less. Professor Avi-Yonah said he has reviewed Professor Hemel\u2019s calculations: \u201cI would rely on them.\u201dEven with such an extreme outcome \u2014 which seems highly unlikely \u2014 Vanguard would remain the cheapest overall fund provider by a wide margin.In short, Vanguard is far from perfect. Mr. Danon appears to have some valid points and may win some further bonuses. And at the end of all this, shareholders would benefit if Vanguard ended up as an even more transparent company than it is right now. How much do top Vanguard executives earn, for example? If we shareholders really own Vanguard, it seems that we should know.I asked that question again last week and Mr. Woerth wouldn\u2019t say.But even without knowing the answer to that question or others raised by Mr. Danon, there seems to be no compelling reason for Vanguard shareholders to switch their investments to another company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Line in the Sand Was Over a Year in the Making", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time and again after the introduction of the iPhone nearly a decade ago, the Justice Department asked Apple for help opening a locked phone. And nearly without fail, the company agreed.Then last fall, the company changed its mind. In a routine drug case in a Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors sought a court order demanding that Apple unlock a methamphetamine dealer\u2019s iPhone 5S running old, easy-to-unlock software. The company acknowledged that it could open the phone, as it had before. But this time, it pushed back.\u201cWe\u2019re being forced to become an agent of law enforcement,\u201d the company\u2019s lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, protested in court.That stance foreshadowed this week\u2019s showdown between the Obama administration and Apple over the locked iPhone belonging to one of the suspects in the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage. By the time of Mr. Zwillinger\u2019s statement, Apple and the government had been at odds for more than a year, since the debut of Apple\u2019s new encrypted operating system, iOS 8, in late 2014.The new technology repeatedly stymied investigators \u2014 the New York authorities said on Thursday that they had been locked out of 175 iPhones in cases they were pursuing. But both sides held out hope for a compromise that would avoid the type of confrontation that occurred this week when a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to comply with the Justice Department\u2019s request.With last October\u2019s court filing, the confrontation became all but inevitable. The company left no doubt that it would fight any effort to crack its new, encrypted phones. The only real question was what crime the government would use to press its case.Apple\u2019s stance that day in Brooklyn caught the Justice Department off guard. Despite the issue with iOS 8, the company had continued to cooperate. In the first half of 2015 alone, the company provided data in response to more than 3,000 law enforcement requests, Apple said. And company lawyers gave prosecutors no indication that the drug case against Jun Feng would be any different.Mr. Feng, 45, claimed to have forgotten his passcode, making his cooperation a moot point even if he were willing to extend it, according to a government filing. Unlike the phone in the San Bernardino case, Mr. Feng\u2019s ran iOS 7, an older version of Apple\u2019s operating system that does not automatically encrypt its data. The Justice Department figured it would have the information from Mr. Feng\u2019s phone within a day.Mr. Zwillinger said the drug case would be Apple\u2019s line in the sand. \u201cCustomer data is under siege from a variety of different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cNever has the privacy and security of customer data been as important as it is now.\u201dIt was a delicate period for the Obama administration, which was focused on finding a way to break into the new encrypted iPhones. The F.B.I., in particular, was lobbying hard to win support for that idea in the face of skepticism from Silicon Valley, Congress and the public.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, described data privacy as a human rights issue. Backed by leading technologists, Mr. Cook argued that if the company designed a way to defeat encryption for the United States government, that tool would be exploited by hackers or foreign governments like China.Under the attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., the Justice Department was sympathetic to that point of view, even in the face of an aggressive campaign from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. Mr. Holder favored meeting with technology executives in the hope of finding common ground, current and former Justice Department officials said.Others in the department strongly disagreed. National security and criminal prosecutors argued that, with the introduction of the encrypted iOS 8, Apple (along with Google, which had started its own encrypted Android phone software) had made thumbing its nose at the government a business strategy. The only hope, these prosecutors argued, was a court fight or an act of Congress requiring companies to provide the government unencrypted data.Local law enforcement officials, too, were sounding alarms. \u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West in technology,\u201d Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference Thursday, echoing complaints he and others have made for many months. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201dWhen the attorney general Loretta E. Lynch and her deputy, Sally Q. Yates, took office last year, the F.B.I. and its law enforcement allies found more receptive ears. Ms. Yates, in particular, took up the issue, giving speeches and testifying before Congress alongside Mr. Comey.Such compromises forestalled a major court showdown, but increased the frustration at the Justice Department. Several current and former career prosecutors involved in the issue said they viewed it as hypocritical that Apple encouraged its customers to save its data to iCloud \u2014 which it would turn over to the government \u2014 but regarded the cellphone as sacrosanct.Then came the Feng case. By refusing to help, the Justice Department thought Apple was sending a clear signal. If it would no longer cooperate with requests to help unlock old phones, there was little chance it would give in and build a way to unlock the new encrypted phones running iOS 8.\u201cForcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said.By that time, 90 percent of Apple devices were running iOS 8 or newer versions. The F.B.I. warned that it was only a matter of time before its agents were locked out of a phone in a case with lives at stake.The San Bernardino attacks, which killed 14 people, presented the F.B.I. with a seemingly perfect test case. One of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, was killed by the police and left behind a locked, encrypted iPhone 5c. The F.B.I. has not been able to unlock it.Mr. Farook\u2019s phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep and Apple says it cannot break the encryption without the password. The F.B.I. wants to write a program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.But Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.\u2019s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.The authorities are still interested in more than just Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. On Thursday, a team of F.B.I. agents raided the Southern California home of his brother, Syed Raheel Farook, and carted off boxes of belongings. The authorities would not say what they were searching for.But there is no telling what is on Mr. Farook\u2019s phone \u2014 maybe clues to accomplices or his inspiration, maybe nothing \u2014 but nobody in the government questioned the need for obtaining access to that data. From a public relations standpoint, Apple had been on the side of privacy advocates and civil libertarians. This case put the company on the side of a terrorist.\u201cThey need to figure that out now before there is that bigger body count. So this is as good a test case as any to have that fight,\u201d said Ron Hosko, who until 2014 led the F.B.I.\u2019s criminal division. \u201cCrack that thing for me now, Tim Cook, because it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201dThis week, the Justice Department got its wish when Apple was ordered to override its defenses, even if it meant building a tool that did not exist.Law enforcement officials cheered the ruling, though they acknowledged that the fight was not over. Apple promised to appeal. In New York, William Bratton, the police commissioner, held up a phone that he said was used by an associate of a man who shot and wounded two police officers in the Bronx recently.\u201cDespite having a court order, we cannot access this iPhone,\u201d Mr. Bratton said. \u201cJust one example, a very significant example in which two of my officers were shot, that impeding that case going forward is our inability to get into this device.\u201dThe case in Brooklyn continues, even though Mr. Feng has already pleaded guilty. While the Justice Department sees the San Bernardino incident as its ideal test case, Apple is hoping for a legal win in Brooklyn.Judge James Orenstein has given the company reason to be hopeful. In the past, he has been skeptical of the way the government uses an 18th-century law \u2014 the All Writs Act \u2014 that the Justice Department is now claiming gives it the authority to force Apple to unlock the phones. He once even described the Justice Department\u2019s use of it as a \u201cHail Mary play.\u201dBut he has yet to rule.An earlier version of this article misidentified the iPhone model of the shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. It was a 5c, not a 5s.Matt Apuzzo and Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Joseph Goldstein from New York. Al Baker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The talks are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said.For Pandora, it would be a curious time to sell. Its shares are yielding a market value of $1.8 billion, down from more than $7 billion two years ago. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since October.\u201cIt has lots of users but can\u2019t grow revenue quickly enough,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt is another stumbling pioneer.\u201dIn its financial results, which Pandora announced Thursday afternoon, the company had $336 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, but spent $143 million in \u201ccontent acquisition costs,\u201d which includes music licenses, and $112.6 million on sales and marketing. For the quarter, the company reported a net loss of $19.4 million, in contrast to $12.3 million in net earnings for the same period the year before.For all of 2015, Pandora had $1.16 billion in revenue, up from $921 million the year before. But the company also reported a net loss for the year of $169.7 million, which included $111.6 million in stock-based compensation and nearly $58 million to settle a royalty dispute with the music industry over recordings made before 1972.Although Pandora\u2019s stock closed at $9.09 for the day, up 8.2 percent, it dropped about 8 percent in after-hours trading on the news of Pandora\u2019s financial results.\u201cPandora hasn\u2019t managed to create a compelling story for Wall Street,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research. \u201cEvery year it is progressively stealing more of total radio listening time, but the street expects a dynamic growth story to accompany a streaming media company.\u201dRepresentatives from Pandora and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Brian P. McAndrews, Pandora\u2019s chief executive, is a director at The New York Times Company.Pandora was introduced in 2005 and uses its own \u201cmusic genome\u201d technology to analyze its customers\u2019 musical tastes and feed them a radiolike stream tailored to what they like.The company generates 80 percent of its revenue from advertising, allowing listeners to stream music free, with ads after every few songs. Pandora also has about 3.9 million customers who pay $5 a month to remove the ads.Last year, Pandora announced deals to pay $450 million for Ticketfly, an online ticketing company, and $75 million for the assets of Rdio, a struggling competitor.Executives at Pandora, whose service is available only in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, have said that they want to expand around the world and turn Pandora into a more robust service that can compete with so-called on-demand outlets like Spotify, Rhapsody and Apple Music, which let users choose exactly what songs to listen to.Some analysts, however, are skeptical of Pandora\u2019s ability to move into new markets and become profitable.\u201cThey are realizing they they\u2019re late in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, when asked about Pandora\u2019s possible sale, \u201cand they have to throw a Hail Mary pass.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The iPhone has a setting that would erase its data after 10 incorrect attempts at the password.

{"Headline": "Justice Department Calls Apple\u2019s Refusal to Unlock iPhone a \u2018Marketing Strategy\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department, frustrated by its inability to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino killings, demanded on Friday that a judge immediately order Apple to give it the technical tools to get inside the phone.Apple\u2019s refusal \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy\u201d rather than a legal rationale, prosecutors said in a court filing that further escalated the confrontation between the Obama administration and Apple.\u201cThis is not the end of privacy,\u201d the Justice Department declared, a mocking reference to Apple\u2019s rationale for contesting the court order prosecutors obtained from a judge directing Apple to help them break into the phone.The sharply worded, 25-page motion to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation seemed aimed as much at swaying public opinion as influencing the federal magistrate judge in Riverside, Calif., who issued the order to Apple.A blistering open letter this week from Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, had rallied many privacy advocates behind the company, and law enforcement officials said that the latest volley from the Justice Department on Friday was meant largely to rebut Mr. Cook\u2019s arguments and buttress the government\u2019s own case.Apple executives, speaking with reporters after the filing on the condition that they not be identified by name, said they were puzzled by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to rush back into court before the company even had a chance to respond to this week\u2019s court order.They reiterated their concerns that the government\u2019s novel demands would endanger the privacy and security of all of their iPhone customers in the future, and said they remained determined to fight the government\u2019s demands.Apple has until next week to respond to an order by a California magistrate this week compelling it to provide the technical assistance that the F.B.I. says it needs to get into the phone.But the Justice Department sought to pre-empt Apple\u2019s response with its own filing on Friday, saying Apple has already made its opposition publicly known and that the \u201curgency of this investigation\u201d demands faster action.\u201cRather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court\u2019s order,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cApple has responded by publicly repudiating that order.\u201dThey went on to accuse Apple of exaggerating how difficult it would be for the company\u2019s computer engineers to come up with a way to get into the phone and to disable an \u201cauto-erase\u201d feature that permanently deletes the data inside after 10 failed password attempts.The Justice Department filed this motion on Friday asking a federal judge to immediately force Apple to help open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.\u201cAt no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the order or that the order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging software development task,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cOn this point, Apple\u2019s silence speaks volumes.\u201dThe Justice Department wants to force Apple to write software that would allow the government to try millions of random password combinations to get into the phone.Apple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company\u2019s engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.The Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone \u2014 something the company does regularly.Apple executives acknowledged on Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.In his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Mr. Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a \u201cchilling\u201d attack on privacy and Internet security.Apple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Mr. Cook\u2019s strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company\u2019s business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple\u2019s business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.With this week\u2019s dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to Apple and the F.B.I. on inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a hearing.The lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the public debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations \u201chas now come to a critical juncture\u201d with this week\u2019s order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.The Justice Department\u2019s latest filing on Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.Among other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the F.B.I concluded, none of those options would work. Among other problems, the default system that backed up the phone on the iCloud had been disabled \u2014 apparently by Mr. Farook \u2014 in October, six weeks before the shootings.In its filing, the Justice Department suggested repeatedly that Apple has put its \u201cmarketing concerns\u201d above its corporate responsibility to comply with a lawful order to assist law enforcement.\u201cApple is not above the law in that regard,\u201d the filing said.Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stance Highlights a More Confrontational Tech Industry", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAfter revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.There will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public\u2019s collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what\u2019s to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?Apple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.Apple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple\u2019s public opposition to the government\u2019s request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.You can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government\u2019s reach.That\u2019s not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201dOne relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201creasonable assistance\u201d will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.In other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes\u00ad.com; Twitter:@fmanjooAdvertisement"}

By 2020, it will make up half. Survey after survey shows that millennials want to work for companies that place a premium on employee welfare, offer flexible scheduling and, above all, bestow a sense of purpose. These priorities are well known and frequently mocked, providing grist for the oft-repeated claim that millennials are lazy, entitled job-hoppers.But it\u2019s important to remember that this generation was shaped by a recession, an unprecedented crush of student debt and a broad decline in the credibility of all kinds of institutions. Stability is an abstract concept to these young workers, so they instead tend to focus on creating a rich, textured life now, rather than planning for a future obscured by uncertainty. How these desires map onto companies like Google and Facebook is clear, given their strong roots in philanthropy and innovation. But the high ranking of national-security employers also speaks, just as clearly, to millennials\u2019 hope to make a difference in the world.Companies that want to attract the best young workers are already finding that they need to accommodate these wishes. The question is whether, when millennials are running things, they will abandon these priorities as youthful indiscretions \u2014 or establish them as the norm.

{"Headline": "Google Joins Race to Speed Up Mobile Delivery of News Articles", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you conduct a Google search on your smartphone for a newsy topic \u2014 say, \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2014 the results starting on Wednesday will include a horizontal carousel of news articles, each with a little lightning bolt icon and the letters AMP at the bottom. Click on any one of the articles, and it will come up immediately, with no wait.The sluggishness is due in part to how websites tend to be built \u2014 old and new technologies are often mixed together on a page.But it is also because publishers have filled their pages with more and more widgets that deliver advertising and collect data on their users as media companies try to find ways to make money in a world where ad revenue is quickly shrinking.Google\u2019s approach, called AMP, or Accelerated Mobile Pages, strips out much of that invisible bloat while preserving the look of the web page and most of the ads.Both Internet companies see fast-loading, high-quality content as important to keeping people searching the web and scrolling through their social news feeds.\u201cWe have said for a long time, speed matters,\u201d said Richard Gingras, who heads news products at Google. \u201cThere is very powerful common cause between Google and publishers. It\u2019s crucial to have a healthy, open web.\u201dFor publishers, which are dependent on Google and Facebook for much of their traffic, working with the companies could hold the key to their future customers. Major media companies, including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Vox Media, BuzzFeed, The Guardian and The New York Times, are participating in both projects as they try to figure out how best to increase traffic and find new loyal readers, while also bringing in revenue from the new formats.\u201cWe want to be where our readers are,\u201d said Kimberly Lau, vice president and general manager of The Atlantic\u2019s digital properties.But Facebook has not shared enough information about the Instant Articles viewership for her to have determined if it was worth giving up the extra ads that are forbidden with Instant Articles.\u201cThe assumption is that the better user experience will deliver more for us. But the jury is still out,\u201d she said.Ms. Lau and other publishing executives have high hopes for Google\u2019s approach, which is more open than Facebook\u2019s and allows for more types of ads and more data collection about users.Google worked for months with content publishers, advertising companies and other partners to develop a new open standard for creating mobile web pages that use as little as one-tenth the data of traditional pages and load up to four times faster.From the start, preserving the ads while speeding them up was a priority. That meant bringing in advertising technology companies and pushing them to improve their load times.Outbrain, which offers an ad product used by many news sites that refers readers to articles by other publications, was blocked by Instant Articles, but the company jumped at the chance to retool its technology so it would work with AMP.\u201cGoogle has definitely done a good job of skinnying up the page,\u201d said Matt Crenshaw, Outbrain\u2019s vice president for product marketing.Publishers have generally praised Google\u2019s open approach, and many said the company was responsive to their particular concerns.The Times, for example, relies heavily on digital subscriptions, with close to 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, and has a corporate goal of doubling its digital revenue by 2020. Google worked closely with The Times to track how many articles visitors were viewing and to prompt them to subscribe when they hit their monthly limit of free articles.\u201cThe way that the meter works is really similar to our current mobile experience,\u201d said Kate Harris, The Times\u2019s director of product who oversees mobile platforms and heads the AMP project. \u201cIt\u2019s truly been a company-to-company collaboration. They flew in a bunch of engineers last week, and we were in a room for many hours,\u201d working on final details.Facebook has been working on a subscription option for months, but still has not offered a solution to publishers that rely on that model.Will Cathcart, the Facebook vice president for product management who oversees Instant Articles, said that hundreds of publishers were participating in the project.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really pleased with how it\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing consumers read more, and they are more likely to share articles they read with their friends.\u201dHe said Facebook was working with publishers to solve specific problems like subscriptions and to share more data while also protecting the privacy of its users.Melissa Bell, vice president of growth and analytics at Vox Media, which is using Instant Articles and AMP, said Vox is overhauling the mobile performance of all its sites, which include Vox.com, SB Nation and Curbed.Interactive graphics, for example, can weigh down a page. \u201cWould it be better to have three graphics that are side by side?\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cYou have to think about this with every story you create.\u201dJulia Beizer, director of product at The Washington Post, said that her publication was an eager participant in all of the experiments, including the nascent News app from Apple, which highlights articles from various publishers on the company\u2019s iPhones and iPads.She said Apple News had sent The Post an unexpected surge of new readers to its science, health and food articles. She credits Instant Articles with sending The Post more repeat visitors. And AMP has cut the time it takes to load a Post mobile web page from three seconds or four seconds to just over half a second.Not all of The Post\u2019s ads transfer properly to the other platforms, she said, and each project takes up valuable time and resources. But right now, publishers need to try it all.\u201cOur interest in going so aggressively at these platforms is learning as much as we can,\u201d Ms. Beizer said. \u201cAnd we have something to offer those companies as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Narrow Focus May Aid F.B.I. in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byInstead, the F.B.I. took the industry by surprise and cleverly stopped short of expectations. The bureau asked Apple for something very specific: that it create an alternative operating system for just one phone that would help the government break into the device. The limited nature of the request has helped the government portray this case as a one-time demand, without ramifications beyond the case at hand.While the F.B.I. is pursuing a narrow focus, Apple is arguing its side as broadly as possible.The company has repeatedly said this case is about much more than the iPhone of one of the attackers from a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14. The company has framed the government\u2019s request as a larger discussion of privacy and civil liberties, and a slippery slope that could open the way to similar demands in the future.The differing approaches are set to be the core of each side\u2019s arguments as Apple and the United States government dig in for an extended period of legal wrangling. Both are betting that their narrow-versus-broad lines of reasoning will help them win both in court and in the court of public opinion.For now, while civil liberties groups and many tech companies say they side with Apple, the government may have carved out an advantage by proffering its narrow argument.\u201cBy making its request so targeted, Apple has fewer grounds to argue their side than had the government asked it to permanently change its code,\u201d said Jason Healey, a former White House security policy director and a research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks that Mr. Cook had made.The greatest fear among many privacy and computer security advocates was that the government would try to force Apple to give up the security keys it uses to digitally sign its code, keys that would let government programmers disable Apple\u2019s security.Instead, the F.B.I. understood that Apple can cleanly install new software on broken phones, without replacing them, and asked the company to make a similar tool that would let investigators break into a work phone issued to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.The bureau has taken pains to note that it did not ask Apple to break the password, and that this solution would not work on newer phones.On Sunday, Mr. Comey\u2019s statement to defend why the agency needed to break into the iPhone said that the court order \u201cisn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.\u201dF.B.I. technical specialists have been working with companies to figure out how to extract data from phones for years.A government official said on Monday that investigators quickly realized that in the San Bernardino case, a technical solution was available. \u201cThis was just the logical extension to what we were already doing,\u201d one senior government official said.\u201cI think Apple was hoping that the request that came was more outrageous,\u201d said Dan Guido, the founder of the security firm Trail of Bits. \u201cThe F.B.I. was very adroit. They waited for the perfect situation where they had all these factors aligned so the request looks pretty straightforward.\u201dTo that point, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., criticized Apple after it refused to comply with the court order and said that they currently possessed 175 iPhones that they could not unlock.Charlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.Mr. Vance responded: \u201cAbsolutely right.\u201dEven people who oppose the Justice Department\u2019s request concede the government made a smart first move, one that could establish precedent to justify more invasive tactics.\u201cThey\u2019ll come up with a reason why for every single phone,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former White House security adviser who, while in government, said he opposed this tactic. But as a strategic matter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s tactically brilliant.\u201dSome citizens and politicians have attacked Apple\u2019s decision, like the families of the San Bernardino victims, Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Senators Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins.To gird for the fight, Apple has hired Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Theodore B. Olson, partners at Gibson Dunn, as outside counsel. Both men have a long history of pushing the courts and the public to see the bigger picture on heated issues including gay marriage.But privately, there is talk among these companies that Apple may have overplayed its hand by taking the issue public in an all-out defiant assault against the F.B.I., according to two people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. These people fear the public may eventually sympathize with the F.B.I.\u2019s argument, especially considering the heinous nature of the crimes.Apple proposed in its statement that federal prosecutors de-escalate the situation by withdrawing their demands, and \u201cas some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the government\u2019s strategy in seeking to force Apple to help it open a terrorist\u2019s iPhone misspelled the surname of one of Apple\u2019s outside lawyers.

{"Headline": "New Technologies Give Government Ample Means to Track Suspects, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than two years the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies have warned that encrypted communications are creating a \u201cgoing dark\u201d crisis that will keep them from tracking terrorists and kidnappers.Now, a study in which current and former intelligence officials participated concludes that the warning is wildly overblown, and that a raft of new technologies \u2014 like television sets with microphones and web-connected cars \u2014 are creating ample opportunities for the government to track suspects, many of them worrying.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Going dark\u2019 does not aptly describe the long-term landscape for government surveillance,\u201d concludes the study, to be published Monday by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.The study argues that the phrase ignores the flood of new technologies \u201cbeing packed with sensors and wireless connectivity\u201d that are expected to become the subject of court orders and subpoenas, and are already the target of the National Security Agency as it places \u201cimplants\u201d into networks around the world to monitor communications abroad.The products, ranging from \u201ctoasters to bedsheets, light bulbs, cameras, toothbrushes, door locks, cars, watches and other wearables,\u201d will give the government increasing opportunities to track suspects and in many cases reconstruct communications and meetings.Over the past year, they have repeatedly told Congress that the move by Apple to automatically encrypt data on its iPhone, and similar steps by Google and Microsoft, are choking off critical abilities to track suspects, even with a court order.President Obama, however, concluded last fall that any effort to legislate a government \u201cback door\u201d into encrypted communications would probably create a pathway for hackers \u2014 including those working for foreign governments like Russia, China and Iran \u2014 to gain access as well, and create a precedent for authoritarian governments demanding similar access.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has led the charge on the other side. He recently told a group of White House officials seeking technology companies\u2019 voluntary help to counter the Islamic State that the government\u2019s efforts to get the keys to encrypted communications would be a boon for hackers and put legitimate business transactions, financial data and personal communications at greater risk.The Harvard study, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, was unusual because it involved technical experts, civil libertarians and officials who are, or have been, on the forefront of counterterrorism. Larry Kramer, the former dean of Stanford Law School, who heads the foundation, noted Friday that until now \u201cthe policy debate has been impeded by gaps in trust \u2014 chasms, really \u2014 between academia, civil society, the private sector and the intelligence community\u201d that have impeded the evolution of a \u201csafe, open and resilient Internet.\u201dAmong the chief authors of the report is Matthew G. Olsen, who was a director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Mr. Obama and a general counsel of the National Security Agency.Two current senior officials of the N.S.A. \u2014 John DeLong, the head of the agency\u2019s Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, the agency\u2019s chief risk officer \u2014 are described in the report as \u201ccore members\u201d of the group, but did not sign the report because they could not act on behalf of the agency or the United States government in endorsing its conclusions, government officials said.\u201cEncryption is a real problem, and the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies are right to raise it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said Sunday. But he noted that in their testimony officials had not described the other technological breaks that are falling their way, nor had they highlighted cases in which they were able to exploit mistakes made by suspects in applying encryption to their messages.He noted that in the current stalemate there was little discussion of the \u201cever-expanding \u2018Internet of things,\u2019 where telemetry from teakettles, televisions and light bulbs might prove surprisingly, and worryingly, amenable to subpoena from governments around the world.\u201dThose technologies are already being exploited: The government frequently seeks location data from devices like cellphones and EZ Passes to track suspects.The study notes that such opportunities are expanding rapidly. A Samsung \u201csmart\u201d television contains a microphone meant to relay back to Samsung voice instructions to the TV \u2014 \u201cI want to see the last three \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movies\u201d \u2014 and a Hello, Barbie brought out by Mattel last year records children\u2019s conversations with the doll, processes them over the Internet and sends back a response.The history of technology shows that what is invented for convenience can soon become a target of surveillance. \u201cLaw enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target,\u201d the report said.These communications, too, may one day be encrypted. But Google\u2019s business model depends on picking out key words from emails to tailor advertisements for specific users of Gmail, the popular email service. Apple users routinely back up the contents of their phones to iCloud \u2014 a service that is not encrypted and now is almost a routine target for investigators or intelligence agencies. So are the tracking and mapping systems for cars that rely on transmitted global positioning data.\u201cI think what this report shows is that the world today is like living in a big field that is more illuminated than ever before,\u201d said Joseph Nye, a Harvard government professor and former head of the National Intelligence Council. \u201cThere will be dark spots \u2014 there always will be.

Icahn and David Einhorn \u2014 disclosed they had sold some of their stakes in the company\u2019s stock over the last three months of 2015.Apple\u2019s debt sale is the second-largest bond offering this year, behind Anheuser-Busch\u2019s $45.8 billion bond issue in January, and more than twice as large as AT&T\u2019s $5.99 billion offering that month, according to Thomson Reuters.Apple habitually uses the debt markets despite having $215.7 billion in cash on its books, largely because 93 percent of that cash is abroad and would incur taxes if it were returned home.Company executives said last month that they planned to be \u201cvery active\u201d in the American and international debt markets this year to pay for Apple\u2019s capital return plan. Apple has completed $153 billion of its $200 billion buyback and dividend program.New investment-grade bond sales were humming along in January until the global markets became anxious about plummeting oil prices and fears of economic weakness.

The way the F.B.I. wants Apple to do that is by writing some new software that bypasses a bunch of safeguards Apple created to help consumers\u2019 phones stay safe in the first place. That is a thing that, for many reasons, Apple does not want to do.The whole thing is fascinating, as it cuts to the heart of so many issues in a rapidly changing age of new technologies, one in which we must decide the balance between our personal right to privacy and digital liberties, and the authority of the government to seek out information in the name of national security.But while I imagine it will take quite some time for the courts to pass judgment, I\u2019m already seeing some fairly clear lines in the sand being drawn. As a token tech reporter living and working in New York, the questions that most normal, nontechies have been asking me is, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Apple care about finding the terrorists? Why is the company acting so anti-American?\u201dThat\u2019s starkly different than what I hear from most people in our industry, but I\u2019d love to hear your take on it and what you\u2019re hearing from people on the West Coast.These questions make me really queasy. What about you?Seriously, though, of course all those things make me nervous. Do I want the government to access my text messages with you? Man, that would look bad.So when the company bound its own hands, I have to ask: What did it expect the government to do, just sit back and say, \u201cOh, well, I guess we won\u2019t request any more data.\u201d Of course not. This is an escalation in a continuing war for reach into consumer data, and now it\u2019s going to court.I think, in general, people don\u2019t want the government snooping on their data. However, I think this is perhaps the absolute worst case Apple and others chose to push back on, considering that it includes questions of terrorism and the mass slaughter of innocents. Tracking down terrorist ties to murderers is far easier for normal, nontechie people to comprehend than the intricacies of software and data extraction.Anyway, I expect this will continue on into our next set of trust falls in 2017.

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Trying to Make It Harder to Hack iPhones", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Apple engineers have begun developing new security measures that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone using methods similar to those now at the center of a court fight in California, according to people close to the company and security experts.If Apple succeeds in upgrading its security \u2014 and experts say it almost surely will \u2014 the company will create a significant technical challenge for law enforcement agencies, even if the Obama administration wins its fight over access to data stored on an iPhone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., rampage. If the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to get into a phone in the future, it would need a new way to do so. That would most likely prompt a new cycle of court fights and, yet again, more technical fixes by Apple.The only way out of this scenario, experts say, is for Congress to get involved. Federal wiretapping laws require traditional phone carriers to make their data accessible to law enforcement agencies. But tech companies like Apple and Google are not covered, and they have strongly resisted legislation that would place similar requirements on them.\u201cWe are in for an arms race unless and until Congress decides to clarify who has what obligations in situations like this,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Companies have always searched for software bugs and patched holes to keep their code secure from hackers. But since the revelations of government surveillance made by Edward J. Snowden, companies have been retooling their products to protect against government intrusion.For Apple, security is also a global marketing strategy. New security measures would not only help the company in its fight with the government, but also reassure investors and customers.\u201cFor all of those people who want to have a voice but they\u2019re afraid, we are standing up, and we are standing up for our customers because protecting them we view as our job,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said on Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.The company first raised the prospect of a security update last week in a phone call with reporters, who asked why the company would allow firmware \u2014 the software at the heart of the iPhone \u2014 to be modified without requiring a user password.One senior executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, replied that it was safe to bet that security would continue to improve. Separately, a person close to the company, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this week that Apple engineers had begun work on a solution even before the San Bernardino attack. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on what she called rumors and speculation.Independent experts say they have held informal conversations with Apple engineers over the last week about the vulnerability. Exactly how Apple will address the issue is unclear. Security experts who have been studying Apple\u2019s phone security say it is technically possible to fix.\u201cThere are probably 50 different ideas we have all sent to Apple,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, a security researcher.But there is a catch. Each iPhone has a built-in troubleshooting system that lets the company update the system software without the need for a user to enter a passcode. Apple designed that feature to make it easier to repair malfunctioning phones.Apple regularly publishes security updates and gives credit to researchers who hunt for bugs in the company\u2019s software. \u201cUsually, bug reports come in an email saying, \u2018Dear Apple Security, we\u2019ve discovered a flaw in your product,\u2019 \u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThis bug report has come in the form of a court order.\u201dThe court order to which Mr. Soghoian referred was issued last week by a federal magistrate, and tells Apple to write and install the code sought by the F.B.I. Apple has promised to challenge that order. Its lawyers have until Friday to file its opposition in court.In many ways, Apple\u2019s response continues a trend that has persisted in Silicon Valley since Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations. Yahoo, for instance, left its email service unencrypted for years. After Mr. Snowden revealed the National Security Agency surveillance, the company quickly announced plans to encrypt email. Google similarly moved to fix a vulnerability that the government was using to hack into company data centers.Apple\u2019s showdown with the Justice Department is different in one important way. Now that the government has tried to force Apple to hack its own code, security officials say, the company must view itself as the vulnerability.\u201cThis is the first time that Apple has been included in their own threat model,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Apple ever considered becoming a compelled arm of the government.\u201dThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., signaled this week that he expected Apple to change its security, saying that the phone-cracking tool the government sought in the San Bernardino case was \u201cincreasingly obsolete.\u201d He said that supported the government\u2019s argument that it was not seeking a skeleton key to hack into all iPhones.Apple, though, says the case could set a precedent for forcing company engineers to write code to help the government break into any iPhone. \u201cThe U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his letter.The heated back-and-forth between the government and technology companies is, at least in part, a function of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy. The White House has said it will not ask Congress to pass a law requiring tech companies to give the F.B.I. a way to gain access to customer data. That has left the Justice Department to fight for access one phone at a time, in court cases that often go unnoticed.While it is generally accepted that Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants can outgun the government in a technical fight, the companies do face one important limitation. Security features often come at the expense of making products slower or clunkier.Apple\u2019s brand is built around creating products that are sleek and intuitive. A security solution that defeats the F.B.I. is unworkable if it frustrates consumers. One of the impediments to encrypting all the data in Apple\u2019s iCloud servers, for instance, has been finding a way to ensure that customers can easily retrieve and recover photos and other information stored there.\u201cTelling a member of the public that they\u2019re going to lose all the family photos they\u2019ve ever taken because they forgot their password is a really tough sell,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said. \u201cA company wants to sell products to the public.\u201dMatt Apuzzo reported from Washington and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers Up Against the App", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe want to show Uber that without us full-time drivers, they won\u2019t have any cars on the road,\u201d Abdoul Diallo shouted from atop a concrete stage. Mr. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who has emerged as a leader of the strikes, was holding up his own sign: \u201cNo Drivers, No Uber \u2014 It\u2019s That Simple.\u201d\u201cThis is the formula!\u201d he hollered to the crowd.\u201cIn the beginning, your company was great for both drivers and customers,\u201d Mr. Diallo and his partners wrote this month in a letter to the service. \u201cYou treated drivers well and we loved you for that. Little did we know that it would be a short-lived momentary ecstasy that you used to lure us in in great numbers, just so that you can execute your plans and strategies toward world domination.\u201dUber, mostly through the voice of Josh Mohrer, the 33-year-old general manager of Uber New York, has said it is pained by the grievances of the drivers, who, while not employees of the service, are known as \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon. Like most tech operations, Uber has a data set for everything, and Mr. Mohrer said his numbers proved that January\u2019s price cut, like a steeper one two years ago, increased the demand for rides and therefore led to larger driver paychecks.\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive to think that lower fares will mean more money, but that is the reality,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added that he understood why the drivers might be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to say, \u2018Just trust us.\u2019\u201d\u201cUber treats its drivers however it wants,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones who do everything except provide the technology.\u201dA former import-export trader who studied for a business degree, Mr. Diallo, 29, has been driving for the company for three years in a $50,000 Chevrolet Suburban. At first, he said, the job was great: He could afford his lease and still make money because he was taking in as much as $5,000 a week.But in 2014, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent and not long after that it increased its commissions. Last year, it forced new drivers working for its luxury arm, Uber Black, to pick up passengers through its less expensive option, UberX. On top of this, Mr. Diallo claimed that Uber\u2019s aggressive hiring has flooded the city with too many drivers chasing too few fares.\u201cPeople can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Mr. Diallo said on the phone after a meeting to coordinate the New York actions with others in London and San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up $8 fares. They\u2019re driving their cars into the ground. Collectively, there\u2019s a lot of money coming in, but no one individual is making much.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it\u2019s literally unbearable.\u201dUber likes to say that its drivers, not its riders, are its customers. And while the company might not give its customers health care or a pension, it does provide them access to high-tech support centers, modeled on Apple\u2019s Genius Bars, where they can ask questions about commercial licenses, receive free medical exams or get a can of soda. Uber also helps its drivers negotiate leases with car dealers.Uber also disputes the claim that there are too many drivers in New York. There are still more taxi riders that the company could woo, and, according to Mr. Mohrer, after the recent cuts were made, trips in the Bronx and Queens, where many drivers live, went up by nearly 25 percent.But if all this data has the weight of scripture for Uber executives, it has been less persuasive to the drivers, who say the statistics do not fully describe the experience of working for the company. Though lower prices might increase their workload and thus their gross, they say, the increased revenue will be eroded by a corresponding increase in expenses.At the Super Bowl rally, a driver named Mustafa, who declined to give his last name because he feared reprisals from Uber, said he expected to make about $40 an hour after the cuts. But that was before he paid for higher costs of maintenance, gas and washes; for his car lease, insurance and sales and income taxes; for emissions inspections and the 2.5 percent of earnings he gives each year to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation; and, of course, for his commissions.\u201cWhen you put it together, the numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mustafa said. \u201cI\u2019m taking home less than minimum wage.\u201d\u201cWe stood behind them,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver who has worked for Uber for a year. \u201cThen they turned around and cut our pay.\u201dAfter speaking this month to an economics class at New York University, Mr. Mohrer acknowledged that when he first came to Uber, there were fewer drivers and stronger bonds between them and his management team. But as the fleet has grown, he said, he has tried to remain responsive to the drivers, who, on average, work 30 hours a week \u2014 or triple the rate of their peers in smaller cities.\u201cThey\u2019re more vested and engaged in Uber, so we take a more careful approach here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper relationship.\u201dBut deeper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean easier. A few weeks ago, Mr. Mohrer met with the leaders of the strikes at his office on West 27th Street in Chelsea\u2019s gallery district. He said they had a frank discussion about the rate cuts, which could be rescinded if the cuts do not achieve their goals. While he was not explicit about what those goals might be, he insisted that the conversation had been useful. \u201cI want to do this regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving drivers the opportunity to speak to me and my staff can result in more rapid change.\u201dThe strikers found the meeting less successful. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThey treated us like jokers.\u201d From his perspective, Mr. Mohrer offered no concessions on the cuts and was firm on only one position: that there would never be a tipping option on Uber\u2019s app.And that was the message Mr. Krasniqi delivered to the crowd in Queens on Super Bowl Sunday. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he reported on the meeting, then told the drivers to call their friends and relatives who also worked for Uber and urge them to stop driving.\u201cThat\u2019s how we built them up \u2014 with our friends and families,\u201d Mr. Krasniqi roared. \u201cAnd if we built them up, we can destroy them!\u201dIt is hard to tell at this point just how serious the threat to Uber from sustained unrest would be. The challenges of organizing a work force composed of men and women of disparate ethnicities and languages loosely connected by a cloud-based app are significant. \u201cIf the drivers can come together in a block causing problems, they might get something,\u201d said Evan Rawley, a professor of strategy at the Columbia Business School who studies the taxi industry. \u201cBut this is not West Virginia coal miners who all grew up together in the same small town.\u201dThere is a potential wild card: Class-action lawsuits have been filed against Uber, including in the federal courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco, which seek to make the drivers full employees. If the suits are successful, they could cripple Uber\u2019s business model, though some legal experts have said they are skeptical that the drivers could prevail when they use their own vehicles, and decide themselves when and whether to pick up passengers.\u201cThe solution is not to stay with Uber,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThe solution is to have our own platform \u2014 to build a real partnership and really be partners.\u201dFor now, however, they are still planning strikes, even if the one on Super Bowl Sunday was of questionable effectiveness. The drivers celebrated the action on their Facebook page, posting a screen shot of Uber\u2019s app that night \u2014 accompanied by the hashtag #SHUTDOWNSUPERBOWL \u2014 that showed a wait time at Kennedy Airport of 72 minutes.But the very next morning, Uber sent an email to its drivers announcing that the day before, it had broken its record for the most trips on a Sunday.\u201cThanks to you, our driver-partners,\u201d the email read, \u201chundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved safely around the city this weekend.\u201dA cover article this weekend about Uber drivers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the company misstates, in some editions, the percent of earnings that Uber drivers pay to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation.

Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\u2019s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.\u201dOther numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the company\u2019s service \u2014 a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers \u2014 and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropbox\u2019s revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the company\u2019s annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\u201cDropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever \u2014 like LinkedIn or Salesforce,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we couldn\u2019t be thrilled with that kind of performance.\u201dBut if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world \u2014 the trend toward business software that doesn\u2019t stink, known as the \u201cconsumerization of information technology,\u201d and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropbox\u2019s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s. When Dropbox visits a company\u2019s chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show \u2014 a large base of the company\u2019s employees who are already using its service.\u201cWe fish in a pond that\u2019s used to our product,\u201d Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropbox\u2019s potential for profit was more attractive than Box\u2019s, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, disputed this assertion. \u201cOur differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers,\u201d he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\u2019s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.An earlier version of this column misstated the fees Dropbox charges its business customers. The fees are about $150 annually for each of the business\u2019s employees, not for each business.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Calls for Boycott of Apple in Dispute With Government", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said, admitting it was a spur-of-the-moment thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you like that?  I just thought of it: Boycott Apple.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099He accused the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, of grandstanding by resisting a court order to provide access to the phone, which has built-in encryption the company says was designed not to be cracked in order to protect users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 private information. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTim Cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said.   Other Republican presidential candidates this week sided with the F.B.I., but did not go as far as Mr. Trump. Senator Ted Cruz said law enforcement was right in this case, but he agreed that Apple should not be forced to put a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbackdoor on every cellphone everyone has.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099Senator Marco Rubio said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very complicated issue,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calling for a solution that would give law enforcement access in some cases but protect the privacy of everyday Americans.Mr. Cook, on the Apple website, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we believe the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump called for a boycott in response to a question from an audience member about how to create jobs for young people. He promised to bring back jobs from China, then said it was important for law enforcement officials investigating the mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif., in December to be able to trace the contacts of one of the shooters.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the idea of boycotting Apple until such time as they get that information,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Trump said. After the rally, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post that his own personal boycott was underway.  \u201cI use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn\u2019t give info to authorities on the terrorists I\u2019ll only be using Samsung until they give info,\u201d he wrote.  \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.
