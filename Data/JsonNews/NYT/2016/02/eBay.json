The phrase \u201cback at it again with the white Vans\u201d is also repeated. This particular catchphrase has delighted corporate America.A tweet from a major brand signals the point where a meme is reaching the beginning of the end of its life span. This is also true when completely unrelated entities try to participate.I don\u2019t get it.While you wait for it to be over, enjoy one of the several \u201cDamn, Daniel\u201d remixes that have cropped up:That was weird and also oddly sort of engrossing.I know.Do you think Daniel is enjoying his Internet fame?He seems pretty comfortable with how things are going. In his appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d that aired on Wednesday, Daniel said that he can\u2019t even go to the mall or a swim meet without being asked for photos with his fans or getting marriage proposals.\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to get married anytime soon,\u201d said Daniel, who at 14 is obviously an old soul. \u201cBut, you know, the girls are just a huge bonus out of all of this.\u201dOn the other hand, Daniel received a lifetime supply of Vans sneakers, and Joshua got a surfboard with \u201cEllen\u201d show branding. So that\u2019s something.Is this all an elaborate ad to make Vans popular again?Unclear. Vans hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment as of Thursday, but the company joined the fun on social media. Last week, Vans published a poll that didn\u2019t really make any sense, which, given the circumstances, is kind of fitting.What advice do celebrities of Internets past have for Daniel?\u201cToday, the lightning of fame can strike any kid with no experience and no business plan,\u201d wrote Mr. Zonday, who at 33 is an elder statesman of viral Internet fame. \u201cSharks circle trying to lock in book deals, national tour deals, private event appearances and management contracts. Do parents know how to make the right choices when this happens? Do parents know how to surround themselves and their viral-star child with good people?\u201dGood questions. Messages sent to \u201cbusiness inquiry\u201d email addresses for Alex Lee (#AlexFromTarget) and Joshua, who created \u201cDamn, Daniel,\u201d went unanswered on Thursday.This has to be a new low for an online frenzy to happen over something so ridiculous, right?Advertisement"}

Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201dHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201dIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

The outcome, though, is far from assured.The plan is the brainchild of the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the European Union. The digital single market involves a raft of new policies that would come into force \u2014 if everything goes according to plan \u2014 by the end of the decade. The proposal has been championed by many political leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.By allowing anyone from Ireland to Bulgaria to tap into the same digital marketplace, policy makers argue, Europeans could access a more diverse \u2014 and often cheaper \u2014 set of online services, from discounted online shopping to video-on-demand programming. Right now, for instance, someone in Spain cannot legally view (or buy) digital movies or sports events that are streamed online by companies based in other European countries.For a new generation of politicians here, the goal \u2014 despite the absence of bonhomie among many countries \u2014 is nothing short of a digital United States of Europe. \u201cThere are going to be no easy victories,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, a former Estonian prime minister who is leading the European Commission\u2019s digital campaign. \u201cIt will be an uphill struggle.\u201dAs a straight-talking Estonian, Mr. Ansip does not do exaggeration. And he\u2019s right about the obstacles, given renewed anxiety about the global economy and the growing number of migrants on Europe\u2019s doorsteps. After all, if politicians can\u2019t agree on who should be let across their borders, some question how much time they will spend on ensuring that Amazon purchases or iTunes subscriptions are delivered efficiently.And many vested interests could still scupper the plans. National television producers, for example, have long supported regulations that restrict people in France, say, from buying video-on-demand services from neighboring Germany. \u201cAs soon as you go across a border, it becomes complicated and costly,\u201d said Paul Todd, head of eBay\u2019s European operations, adding that basic hurdles like high shipping costs limit people from reaching new customers. \u201cThere are annoying barriers to doing business.\u201dA potentially deeper problem is that basic Internet skills \u2014 along with other essential services like high-speed mobile networks \u2014 vary drastically among European countries, as does understanding of e-commerce and general familiarity with the online world.As a result, experts say, those countries accustomed to living in an online world may well plow ahead with Europe\u2019s plans for a digital single market, while less tech-savvy neighbors \u2014 including Portugal and Spain \u2014 could easily be left behind.\u201cEveryone says we need a single digital market,\u201d said Giuseppe Recchi, chairman of Telecom Italia, the country\u2019s former telecom monopoly. \u201cBut how do you make that happen so that everyone prospers?\u201dMark Scott is the European technology correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Track Record of Shake-Ups at the Top", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byUps and downs are nothing new in the fast-moving technology industry. And as soon as a company hits turbulence, calls for a management shake-up almost always follow.History suggests that changing course can have big results. But not every company has needed to shake up its ranks to regain its footing. And even those that did bring in new management have found themselves under attack again:In the late 1990s, Priceline seemed to have the golden touch. On its first day of trading in 1999, its market value hit $12.9 billion. At the time, it was the highest first day valuation of any company that had gone public.The company\u2019s stock plummeted. At one point, the company was worth less than $250 million.Over the years, Priceline acquired competitors including Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, becoming dominant in the online travel segment. By 2010, it surpassed Expedia in online hotel reservations. It now has a market value of $53 billion.Keeping competition at bay is critical for any technology company, said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf you\u2019ve discovered a valuable space, there\u2019s a lot of companies, new entrants,\u201d he said.Amazon was a pioneer in web retailing, beginning with online book sales in 1995. In 1999, Time magazine anointed the founder, Jeff Bezos, its Person of the Year. But the company had not recorded a profit in its early years, causing some analysts and investors to question whether it was any different than all the other dot-coms that failed by 2001.\u201cAt Amazon, they were ruthlessly committed to the customer experience,\u201d said Nick Donatiello, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cAnd that is still their strategy.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Bezos consistently relayed his growth plan to investors.That\u2019s unlike some tech companies like Yahoo and Twitter, Professor Hsu of Wharton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear communication either by way of their actions or their words as to how they are going stay relevant.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is unlikely Bezos could have anticipated how the various initiatives would turn out,\u201d he added. \u201cHe therefore had some sense of the necessary pacing of new business introductions to widen the touch points Amazon would need to ultimately win.\u201d\u201cIt took a change in management to clean up some prior misdirection and set a new strategy,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cTo make these changes, the company needed to \u2018reset expectations\u2019 and take the short-term hit from Wall Street as it invested for the long-term gain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers and Others in the Gig Economy Take a Stand", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLast September, Dallas-area drivers for UberBlack, the company\u2019s high-end car service, received an email informing them that they would be expected to start picking up passengers on UberX, its low-cost option.The next day, when the policy was scheduled to go into effect, dozens of drivers caravaned to Uber\u2019s office in downtown Dallas and planted themselves outside until company officials met with them. Many had taken out loans to buy luxury vehicles that cost upward of $35,000, and worried that the modest per-mile rate for UberX passengers would barely cover gas and wear and tear, to say nothing of their car payments.The standoff stretched across nearly three more tense days until Uber allowed them to opt out of the policy. \u201cThey thought we were just going to give up, walk away,\u201d said Kirubel Kebede, a leader of the group. \u201cBut we said, \u2018No, this is our livelihood.\u2019\u201dIn the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies. Some are beginning to band together in search of leverage and to secure what they see as fairer treatment from the platforms that make the work possible.\u201cWe started realizing we\u2019re not contractors, we\u2019re more like employees,\u201d said Berhane Alemayoh, one of the UberBlack drivers in Dallas. \u201cThey tell us what kind of car to drive. They kick you out if a customer accused you of not having a clean car. They started to tighten the rope. Gradually, we can\u2019t breathe any more.\u201dPerhaps the most prominent effort was a measure to give ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize in Seattle, which was approved by the City Council in December.But while many campaigns by alienated workers have shunned this more traditional labor-organizing approach, they have highlighted a basis for advancing the interests of gig economy workers collectively.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of workplace identity and group consciousness despite the insistence from many of these platforms that they are simply open \u2018marketplaces\u2019 or \u2018malls\u2019 for digital labor,\u201d said Mary L. Gray, a researcher at Microsoft Research and professor in the Media School at Indiana University who studies gig economy workers.The efforts extend well beyond drivers for Uber and its prime competitor, Lyft. A group of couriers who find work on the platform Postmates is waging a campaign to create an \u201cI\u2019m done after this delivery\u201d button because they worry that turning down jobs will affect how many future assignments they receive. (A Postmates official said turning down jobs had no effect on future work, but that the company was still sympathetic to the idea.)The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which organizes nannies and housekeepers, recently produced what it calls the Good Work Code, which it has urged gig economy companies to adopt.\u201cThey would be dispatched to a home that didn\u2019t feel safe, but would be hesitant to exit themselves from that situation because it might affect their ratings,\u201d said Palak Shah, the alliance official leading the effort, citing one of several issues that the Good Work Code is intended to address. A handful of firms, like Managed by Q, LeadGenius and CareLinx, have embraced the guidelines.Though the so-called Turkers tend to value the flexibility and independence of freelancing and often reject the idea of a traditional union, many have also developed a kind of working-stiff identity. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them say Jeff Bezos is their boss \u2014 we\u2019re workers here,\u201d said Niloufar Salehi, a Stanford Ph.D. student who spent a year immersed in Turker forums to help the workers organize.By contrast, sellers of goods on digital marketplaces like eBay and Etsy rarely think of themselves as employees. In their minds, they say, they are independent artisans and shopkeepers.\u201cEtsy is the place where the shop exists, where I pay rent,\u201d said Sandie Russo, a longtime seller of hand-knit accessories and knitting patterns who once ran an online forum in which sellers helped one another address common problems. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely that you\u2019re an entrepreneur, not a worker.\u201dLike the Etsy shopkeepers, many Uber drivers began their relationship with the company thinking of themselves as self-employed.Unlike sellers on eBay or Etsy, Uber drivers cannot set the prices they charge. They are also constrained by the all-important rating system \u2014 maintain an average of around 4.6 out of 5 stars from customers in many cities or risk being deactivated \u2014 to behave a certain way, like not marketing other businesses to passengers.The experience of the Dallas UberBlack drivers is telling. When Uber entered Dallas in 2012, many of the drivers were either independent hired-car operators or contractors for limousine companies who bought or leased their own cars.\u201cSome had their own business, they were fine with the business,\u201d Mr. Alemayoh said. \u201cThey just used Uber as a complement.\u201dThe drivers formed a tactical alliance with the company to help it gain the city\u2019s approval, which local cab operators resisted. Mr. Alemayoh even sang Uber\u2019s praises in testimony before the Houston City Council, after the company asked him to speak there as part of its expansion efforts. \u201cI said it\u2019s fair to drivers to have Uber,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI spoke on their behalf, they didn\u2019t pay me.\u201dBut the relationship began to sour in 2014, when the company decreed that drivers with cars made before 2008 would no longer be able to participate in UberBlack.\u201cWe said, \u2018You guys are affecting so many families,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kebede, a leader of a group called the Association of Limousine Owners and Operators of Dallas Fort Worth, formed the previous year. Uber extended the grace period by several months in some cases but did not reverse the policy.By the time Uber handed down its UberX directive in September, the drivers had long since recognized that they were at the company\u2019s beck and call. Because of Uber\u2019s popularity, almost all their other sources of business had dried up. And Uber had earned the imprimatur of the City Council, which made the drivers politically expendable, too.So it was something of a surprise that the drivers\u2019 association, which represents about 500 of the 2,000 to 3,000 black-car drivers it believes are active in the Dallas area, was able to push Uber not only to scale back the UberX change, but also to reinstate several of the drivers it had deactivated for pressuring fellow drivers as the showdown escalated.Some continue to be deactivated for what they feel are arbitrary reasons, which Uber maintains are unrelated to the protest (\u201cDrivers have the right to free expression and we respect that,\u201d said a company representative). But to the extent that the Dallas drivers have been successful, one crucial advantage is that they were able to organize in person rather than depend exclusively on the Internet and social media.That also helps explain the success of the campaign in Seattle, where Uber had previously reversed a rate cut after facing pressure from drivers. (Uber maintains that the reversal was unrelated.) \u201cThe drivers have gone out and talked to each other,\u201d said Dawn Gearhart, a spokeswoman in the area for the Teamsters union, which provides support services to local drivers. \u201cEvery time they would call a meeting, a couple hundred people would show up.\u201dIn the Tampa area, drivers have protested cuts that brought rates down to 65 cents a mile from 95 cents as of early January, and from $1.20 as recently as last spring. Net earnings for drivers there can come perilously close to subminimum wage rates on a 15- to 20-minute trip in town once they factor in pickup and wait times and the cost of gas, depreciation and maintenance.\u201cWe sometimes lower prices in a city to get more people using Uber,\u201d said an Uber representative. \u201cAs we have always said, price cuts need to work for drivers. If they do not, we will roll them back.\u201d In response, the Tampa area drivers started a weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers. During that time, they write messages on their windows about what they consider unlivable wages. The group has grown rapidly to a network of 700 drivers who communicate via an app-based walkie-talkie service called Zello.The Tampa drivers\u2019 goal is to enlist Uber\u2019s most politically valuable asset \u2014 legions of customers who have grown dependent on the service \u2014 to help send a message to Uber. Over time, they hope to extend the logouts to several hours, perhaps even a full day on the weekend.\u201cIt\u2019s a little blip on Uber\u2019s radar,\u201d said Josh Streeter, one of the leaders. \u201cBut then people might believe they have the power. That if they band together, they could pull off a bigger action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bronx Precinct Where Killings Persist", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Murder in the 4-0The death of a woman at the Mott Haven Houses in the 40th Precinct reveals a swirl of deeper dysfunction.Supported byThe strangers slept no more than a dozen steps apart in a housing project in the South Bronx \u2014 she on a cot pushed up against the wall in the living room of her ailing mother\u2019s apartment, and he in a narrow, airless hallway of the building, on the threshold of his family\u2019s door.She worried he had been locked out of his apartment, and one day last month told her mother she wanted to offer him some soup. But the mother, mindful of the danger that faces residents in the stairwells and expansive courtyards of the Mott Haven Houses, warned her it was the kind of encounter that could get her killed.\u201cPsychotic Disorder,\u201d detectives wrote in their initial investigative report about the Jan. 24 killing, adding that Mr. Feliz-Volquez was a \u201cdiagnosed schizophrenic perpetrator.\u201dBut the murder sprang from a swirl of deeper dysfunction, from a public-housing system that remains a redoubt for the sort of serious crime that once plagued much of New York City, and from a string of government encounters that failed to keep Mr. Feliz-Volquez from hurting more people as his mental health deteriorated.Entrenched violence in housing projects and uneven, ineffective services for mentally ill poor people are among the stubborn causes of what killings remain in an era of historically low crime, spurring intense but often frustrating efforts by the police to identify and track the most violent and most vulnerable.To understand how and why killings continue in a city that has seen crime fall to historic lows, The New York Times is reporting this year on violence in the 40th Precinct, and documenting the story of each homicide.But the vast tracts of public housing are not going away, and residents still speak of routines shaped by day-to-day violence whose victims they say are often ignored \u2014 among them undocumented immigrants, many from Mexico, who worry about coming forward to report crime. Homicides in the precinct reached 21 in 2011, after hovering between eight and 16 for a decade before that, and then dropped to 12 in 2012, eight in 2013 and seven in 2014 before rising again last year.Roughly a third of the precinct\u2019s 95,000 residents live in public housing, and data show that people who live in those buildings and on their edges are packed almost twice as densely as residents of the precinct over all. The 15th Congressional District, which includes the area, is the poorest in the United States.\u201cHousing and gangs,\u201d said Robert K. Boyce, the Police Department\u2019s chief of detectives, who led the 40th Precinct from 2000 to 2002. \u201cEach housing development has its own little gang or crew.\u201dFor people who live there and watch friends fall victim to crime, fear has remained a fact of life across generations.But Ms. Torres-Gonzalez, who earned a secretarial degree in Puerto Rico before moving in the 1980s to the Bronx, where she taught Spanish to children, tried not to be intimidated by such fears. In a building where tenants are often afraid to open their doors for strangers, Ms. Torres-Gonzalez was a confident presence, coaxing neighbors out with food or a favor.Since her 77-year-old mother came out of a coma two years ago, Ms. Torres-Gonzalez stayed with her each night, cooking sorullos \u2014 fried cornmeal sticks \u2014 and helping her get around. During the day, she visited grieving families at nearby hospitals \u2014 her own husband died from cancer 20 years ago \u2014 and prepared gift boxes for a church group that supported victims of domestic violence.She had been battling lung cancer for about a year but did not tell many people, including her two daughters, because she did not want to burden them. She went to Bible study each Saturday at a storefront church, Ministerio Se\u00f1or y Rey, reciting her favorite Scripture, Jeremiah 29:11: \u201c\u2018For I know the plans I have for you,\u2019 declares the Lord, \u2018plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u2019\u201d\u201cShe had a very strong voice,\u201d said Carmen Martinez, 85, a neighbor, recalling how Ms. Torres-Gonzalez banged on her triple-locked door with a half-bowl of salami soup on the morning of the killing. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t as timid as I am.\u201dMs. Torres-Gonzalez\u2019s voice became a preoccupation of Mr. Feliz-Volquez, who told the police after his arrest that he heard her calling his name in the middle of the night and talking about him. He told investigators he thought she and an upstairs neighbor had been spying on him. He is now at the Rikers Island jail complex after being charged with second-degree murder; Amy Attias, his court-appointed lawyer, said she had asked for a psychiatric exam.It was not the first time he had heard voices that others say were not there. In March, he was charged with cracking a plate over the head of a manager at a Manhattan restaurant where he worked. He told the authorities that his co-workers were talking about him when they thought he was not listening, several co-workers briefed on his statements said.\u201cTo me, that\u2019s evidence something\u2019s going on inside this person\u2019s mind that\u2019s not real,\u201d one co-worker, Colin Bryson, said.Mr. Feliz-Volquez was ordered to complete seven days of community service and an anger-management program. His contact with the authorities only increased, though. Since June, his erratic behavior had drawn at least four visits by the authorities, a law enforcement official said. Each time he was taken for observation to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center.\u201cThis may very well have been able to be avoided,\u201d Ms. Attias said of the killing. She added that Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s \u201cfamily had been looking for help and in some ways the system was aware of the existence of this problem well before this poor woman was killed.\u201dMr. Feliz-Volquez, who was born in the Dominican Republic, used to speak of wanting to be a professional volleyball player, his grandmother, Maria Matos, said. He loved going to Citi Field to watch baseball. He studied hard at Walton High School in the Bronx, and took a job at McDonald\u2019s to help his single mother with the rent, Ms. Matos said.In 2012, he began teaching soccer at Children\u2019s Village, a community center for at-risk children in Westchester County.\u201cThe Angel that I knew, there was not anything wrong with him,\u201d said Carlos Cuevas, a co-worker there who grew up with Mr. Feliz-Volquez in the Dominican Republic. \u201cHe was a quiet guy, a very respectful guy, a great guy.\u201dMs. Matos said his mental illness surfaced about a year ago, when he told his mother that he could not sleep and had stopped eating or drinking anything but lots of coffee. Clothes started sagging off his 6-foot-1 frame.\u201cI think it was the depression that got him,\u201d Ms. Matos said.A family friend from Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s church got him a job as a dishwasher at Asia de Cuba in downtown Manhattan. A few nights after its grand opening, a manager, Felipe Murcia, was scraping dirty dishes into the garbage.Then the room went black. When he came to, Mr. Murcia was staggering backward, blood dripping from a gash on his forehead that required 35 stitches. Shattered plates lay on the floor, and Mr. Bryson subdued Mr. Feliz-Volquez.\u201cWhy\u2019d you do this?\u201d Mr. Bryson recalled asking.\u201cYou know what you do,\u201d he said Mr. Feliz-Volquez replied.All that his co-workers had done, they said, was invite him to meals, only to be rebuffed. He refused to speak Spanish, and insisted that his Dominican co-workers use the English pronunciation of Angel, rather than the Spanish one.When one employee tried to introduce herself, Mr. Feliz-Volquez answered, \u201cMy name is no name.\u201dAfter the attack, Mr. Bryson and the chef, Brendan Mica, barricaded him inside the room, only to watch as Mr. Feliz-Volquez changed into street clothes and waited for the police.Mr. Feliz-Volquez was charged with felony second-degree assault for hitting Mr. Murcia with a plate. In August, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge; Mr. Murcia said prosecutors told him they could not prove that Mr. Feliz-Volquez had used a plate.Mr. Murcia said doctors told him the wound must have been caused by a hard object. He said prosecutors did not question him thoroughly, emphasizing that Mr. Feliz-Volquez had no record and suggesting that Mr. Murcia must have provoked the attack. Mr. Murcia now questions whether prosecutors could have done more to pursue the felony assault charges against Mr. Feliz-Volquez.\u201cI felt like they didn\u2019t really do the job, and they were just lingering around with this case,\u201d Mr. Murcia said. \u201cIf they would have put a little more pressure, or this guy would have ended up in jail, this would not have happened to this woman.\u201dMr. Mica said he told prosecutors that Mr. Feliz-Volquez needed psychiatric help, and Mr. Bryson recalled telling prosecutors that there was no way to explain Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s \u201cunfounded hostility.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mysterious no one seemed to take that seriously,\u201d Mr. Bryson said.Mental illness was not raised publicly by Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s defense lawyer or prosecutors, according to court records and a transcript of his plea hearing. Asked about the prosecutors\u2019 handling of the case, Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, said the office would continue to support second chances, particularly for first-time offenders. But, she said, \u201cprosecutors do not have a crystal ball and there is always the possibility that someone may re-offend.\u201d\u201cThe next stage, now that we\u2019ve learned some lessons about how to do this well, is to work with all of the different agencies to figure out cases like Angel\u2019s, I think, where a red flag should be raised,\u201d she said.Social workers for the New York City Housing Authority are charged with helping some psychiatric patients returning home from hospitalizations, most of whom are not a threat, though the risk of violence increases when a person is off medication and psychotic. But residents said it remained difficult for social workers or the police to monitor what was happening within the four walls of a home, especially in housing projects where people feel isolated from community programs and jobs. Many tenants yearn for stronger interventions by the city.\u201cPeople are very frustrated about the lack of services,\u201d said John Johnson, the president of the tenant association at the Mott Haven Houses. \u201cPeople are very, very frustrated with crime.\u201dThe details of Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s medical treatment are confidential, but his grandmother said he spent at least three days at the hospital on his first visit, which she thought was mainly related to insomnia. She worried about his being prescribed medication.\u201cI told him in the hospital he should try to sleep on his own rather than get accustomed to taking the pills,\u201d Ms. Matos said. \u201cI said, \u2018Try to make an effort to sleep on your own.\u2019 He answered, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201dShe said his recovery was short-lived. One of the first signs was that Mr. Feliz-Volquez had stopped accompanying his mother to church on Sundays. Around Christmastime, he bought the machete on eBay, storing it under his bed, according to the police.His apartment was five and a half linoleum tiles across from the door of Ms. Torres-Gonzalez\u2019s mother, at the end of the fifth-floor hallway.Two days after the killing, splotches of dried blood stained those tiles. \u201cBastard!\u201d a friend of Ms. Torres-Gonzalez screamed in the hallway, prefacing it with an expletive, her voice echoing off the walls.Mr. Feliz-Volquez\u2019s door would later be tagged with graffiti reading \u201cKiller\u201d and \u201cJustice will be served,\u201d but this was a day for a more basic task.Another woman was on her hands and knees, a Lysol bottle in one hand and a green cloth in the other, scrubbing her friend\u2019s blood from the floor. A hallway light above flickered off before they went inside.Reporting was contributed by Noah Remnick, Nate Schweber, Isvett Verde and Susan Weber-Stoger. Susan C.

{"Headline": "Male Sellers on eBay Have an Edge Over Women, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported bySuccessful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price.Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men.The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received.\u201cThe basic point \u2014 that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating and depressing,\u201d said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.\u201cOn eBay, wow,\u201d she added, noting eBay\u2019s fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. \u201cThis would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.\u201dThe study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience.Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said.\u201cWe actually think that most of it is unconscious,\u201d said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. \u201cThe fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.\u201dBesides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest.In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a $100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alison\u2019s gift card was valued at $83.34, while Brad\u2019s was valued at $87.42.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. \u201cJust perceiving that somebody\u2019s a woman, what exactly does it mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something that\u2019s not captured in the data that they have.\u201dWithout that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that \u201cthe majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, \u2018This really isn\u2019t a 1948 Rolex\u2019 or \u2018This really isn\u2019t Jackie Robinson\u2019s signature.\u2019 \u201dThe researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBay\u2019s broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded.EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers\u2019 contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay \u201cended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.\u201dEBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. \u201cThis study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cWe are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.\u201dA few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women.Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for \u201c$100 or best offer,\u201d she was offered $50.\u201cI countered $75, and their message to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t know what this is worth because you\u2019re a girl,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells women\u2019s clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses.In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii).The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying \u201cworks great\u201d more often than \u201cnever used,\u201d for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap.Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, \u201cI did not think, \u2018Oh, eBay needs to fix this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think this is a key thing we\u2019ve got to do for gender equality.\u201dStill, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of \u201cthe importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesn\u2019t mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a study that found eBay customers tend to bid higher for items sold by men rather than women misidentified the journal that published the study. It is Science Advances, not Science.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Tools to Keep Those Creepy Online Ads From Watching You", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAY you\u2019re doing a web search on something like the flu. The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol.The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television.This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets.\u201cOur privacy is completely under assault with all these connected devices,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties \u2014 like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies \u2014 that compile information on consumers.When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals.The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits.The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an add-on for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The anti-tracking companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist.Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said.\u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users.\u201d\u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities.\u201dIn our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday.com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight.But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first.\u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground.\u201dIn the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content.Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles; on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re talking megabillion-dollar industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Court, and F.B.I. Presses Congress to Settle iPhone Privacy Fight", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOther technology companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo \u2014 also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201dThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201dIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201dApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201dA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201dApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked information about the government\u2019s mass surveillance programs.Katie Benner and Nick Wingfield reported from San Francisco and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.

{"Headline": "Across Britain, Silent Relics of the Cold War", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byPursuitsBuried beneath the breadth of Britain lies a legacy of the Cold War that was once a closely guarded secret but is now simply forgotten.Because of its proximity to Eastern Europe \u2014 a Soviet missile would have taken only four minutes from detection to reaching its target \u2014 many in Britain felt the Cold War nuclear threat with a visceral immediacy. The result is the extensive network of bunkers planted by the government during the Cold War, from the 1,500-plus small radiation monitoring posts all over Britain, generally in rural and remote areas, to the more than a dozen enormous underground bunker complexes from which the country could have been governed if the capital was annihilated. The bunkers, many of which are now open to the public, were part of a vast plan that struck me on a recent visit as impressive but practically futile; more a balm against atomic fear than a viable survival plan.During the Cold War, Britain became known as America\u2019s \u201cunsinkable aircraft carrier\u201d for hosting its ally\u2019s atomic bombers, long-range communications systems, intelligence infrastructure and missiles, making the threat of a nuclear strike palpable, wrote Nick Catford in \u201cCold War Bunkers,\u201d an engrossing book of photographs published in 2010. Mr. Catford is a member of Subterranea Britannica, an English club dedicated to the study of all manner of underground sites. To counter this threat, the author wrote, \u201cBritain became the most densely enbunkered nation in the world.\u201dI was born in 1974 and have always been interested in the Cold War imagery that dominated the political and popular culture of my formative years, from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d Strategic Defense Initiative to movies like \u201cWarGames\u201d and \u201cRed Dawn,\u201d and the scary, anti-proliferation songs of Ozzy Osbourne such as \u201cKiller of Giants\u201d and the MTV staple \u201cCrazy Train.\u201dNowhere on my tour was the psychic dread of the Cold War more in evidence than at the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker in Essex \u2014 about 25 miles northeast of central London \u2014 which bills itself as the \u201cbiggest and deepest Cold War bunker open to the public in Southeast England.\u201d The bunker, which was decommissioned in the early 1990s, could hold 600 military and civilian personnel, all locked underground behind one-and-a-half-ton blast doors. Arrangements were made to stash the prime minister and a provisional government there, but the only human forms during my visit were creepy life-size mannequins dressed in military uniforms, often with wigs askew, meant to illustrate life in the various wings of the bunker, including the canteen, sick bay, dormitories and military headquarters.Visitors to the museum are greeted by a dated, grainy video of Mike Parrish, the bunker\u2019s owner. Mr. Parrish appears on the television screen as a man in late middle age with a tidy gray beard and a maroon V-neck sweater emblazoned with a trefoil \u2014 the international symbol of radiation. His sober, businesslike instructions for how to proceed unaccompanied through the complex have the air of a recording intended to be played in the event of his untimely death.The bunker was built by the Royal Air Force in 1952 after the land under which it sits was bought compulsorily from the Parrish family. Initially intended as a radar installation, the bunker evolved into what Mr. Parrish describes in the video as \u201cthe would-be home of regional government in the event of nuclear attack.\u201d In the early \u201990s the bunker was sold back to the family, who now runs it as a distinctly improvised tourist attraction. I was instructed to follow white arrows shaped like guided bombs and to drop \u00a37 in an honesty box at the end of the tour, while signs advising customers that they are being watched on closed circuit TV amplify a general air of menace.The Kelvedon Hatch facility is one of more than a dozen underground government headquarters in Britain and is both gloriously bizarre and genuinely fascinating, with the owners\u2019 morbid sense of humor making itself evident in the exhibits and, especially, on the deadpan audio guide. It stands in stark contrast to the Churchill War Rooms in central London, one of the slickest and well-attended tourist attractions in England. Though used only during World War II, Churchill\u2019s tidy war rooms, with their lifelike wax figures and careful attention to historical detail, provide an excellent antecedent for the bunker fever that would sweep England, which was very much informed by the German bombing raids during the war.The bunker at Kelvedon Hatch is entered though an unassuming farm cottage, which is really just a steel and concrete-reinforced shell of a house. As I descended a 120-yard-long tunnel and held a clunky red audio-tour handset to my ear, the laconic voice of Mr. Parrish inquired, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve given the next war very much thought?\u201d He went on to describe how the soil above would produce no viable harvest for three years after a nuclear attack, during which time one would contend for food with \u201cmarauding gangs\u201d of radiation-sickened survivors in an environment resembling that of medieval times.The prevailing wisdom held that a nuclear war would follow a few weeks of escalating tension \u2014 much as there was during the Cuban Missile Crisis \u2014 then a short conventional war followed by all-out nuclear war, which Mr. Parrish described on the audio tour as \u201cthe big bang.\u201d Apart from being guarded full time by a handful of soldiers and during routine equipment checks, the bunker wasn\u2019t regularly manned during much of its Cold War life, but would have been staffed and stocked with food and water if war was thought imminent.The damp, musty entrance tunnel deposits visitors approximately 100 feet underground at the bunker\u2019s deepest level, which was thought to be the safest. It was there that the three-story bunker\u2019s most critical operations were housed, including the enormous air filtration and cooling systems crucial to running the bunker and the map-laden \u201cplotting rooms\u201d where military and civilian staff would have tried to determine the size and nature of the attack and severity of the fallout.Also on this bottommost level were the dimly lit communications rooms \u2014 from which the bunker\u2019s staff would have coordinated a military response and relayed instructions to the survivors above \u2014 which felt like a monument to obsolete equipment. It accommodated more than 2,500 telephone lines, and the teleprinters that would have spat out instructions still sit on desks near an old \u201cdoll\u2019s eye\u201d telephone exchange on which an operator would have patched calls through by connecting wires with the relevant sockets, from the bunker\u2019s earliest days.Packed and piled into every free space were unlabeled and random-seeming pieces of communications equipment, instruments, protective clothing, maps and paperwork. On one desk was a copy of a commercial telephone book left open to the pages listing funeral directors. On another sat old editions of The Daily Mail, including one chronicling the Queen\u2019s coronation, bearing the headline, \u201cLet Us Cherish Our Own Way of Life.\u201dNearby I peered into the still-intact BBC broadcasting studio from which the prime minister, should he or she have been spirited to the bunker, could have spoken to the nation. At the microphone sits a smiling mannequin dressed in a fuchsia dress that bore a strong resemblance to Margaret Thatcher. A soundtrack of sirens, bleeps, alerts and emergency announcements is all that broke the eerie silence.The bunker, said the voice of Mr. Parrish, was about protecting the people who \u201cwill pop up at the appropriate time and bring to you and me, the survivors, hope, help, succor and maybe a little bit of food.\u201d Those people \u2014 civil servants, scientists, military personnel and government officials \u2014 would have worked from the bunker\u2019s middle floor, which still contains work stations with yellowing desktop computers and analog rotary telephones. I laughed out loud when I peered into a cell labeled \u201cprime minister\u201d and saw a grinning mannequin with silver, side-parted hair \u2014 presumably John Major \u2014 lying on a cot, tucked to his chin under a gray blanket.The bunker\u2019s top floor, closest to the surface, has rows of bunk beds and a sick bay, where mannequins in surgical scrubs preside over bandaged mannequin patients.On my way out I dropped \u00a32 in the honesty box at a photo station and prepared to have my portrait taken in a gas mask, before realizing that there was nobody around to operate the Polaroid camera. I recalled Mr. Parrish\u2019s chilling words on the audio guide when he said if the cottage above took a direct hit, \u201cthen this is where you\u2019d have spent the rest of your life.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere is nobody up there, and anyway it\u2019s secret, so nobody knows you\u2019re here.\u201dA more genial mood prevailed the following day, when I met two Subterranea Britannica members, Ed Combes and Mark Russell, on the outskirts of the West Sussex village of Cuckfield, at the Royal Observer Corps monitoring post they have restored. The post is no more than a tiny room buried 15 feet underground, from which a team of civilian volunteers would have analyzed the fallout from a nuclear attack and sent the data they collected back to a plotting room, like the one I saw at Kelvedon Hatch.We were joined by the club\u2019s chairman, Martin Dixon, and his wife, Linda.Above ground, the post is unassuming. A small, green-painted concrete cube topped with a hatch pokes out of the ground amid a three-acre, fenced-in parcel of land that also contained a beekeeper\u2019s hives and four grazing sheep. A cylindrical probe \u2014 the radiation detector \u2014 protrudes from the grass a few yards away from the hatch near the post\u2019s air vent, which sprouts below a mast flying the light blue flag of the Royal Observer Corps, the volunteer force that would, theoretically, warn the populace of an imminent nuclear strike and measure its fallout.In 1991 work in the post came to an abrupt halt when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War thawed, said Mr. Russell, who has visited around 900 of them, many of which still have cigarette butts in the ashtrays from the last day the volunteers were down there, or an old tea bag left in a cup. \u201cThey are proper little time capsules,\u201d he said.Mr. Combes, 35, and Mr. Russell, 37, both had collections of artifacts from observer corps posts when they began restoring the one in Cuckfield, chosen because it was in relatively good shape. \u201cSome of them were flooded or had dead animals in them, or kids had been inside and set fire to them,\u201d said Mr. Russell. With permission from the local council, they cleaned it up and stocked it with Cold War-era supplies, hardware and provisions, which were either donated by former observers, traded for with other collectors or bought on eBay, Mr. Combes said. In 2010 they began opening it for free public tours several weekends a year.The post at Cuckfield is one of a handful the public can visit, but Subterranea Britannica (\u201cSub Brit,\u201d to those in the know) organizes access for its more than 1,100 dues-paying members to various other underground and secret Cold War sites that are not generally accessible. Mr. Dixon, the club\u2019s chairman, told me he enjoys underground sites from coal mines to transportation tunnels to military installations because, whatever their age, they are a good prism through which to study history. \u201cNothing is more exciting than going into a place that few others have seen or seeing something that\u2019s been hidden for hundreds of years,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cand you\u2019re never too far from the pub.\u201dOne by one we descended the ladder to the cramped shaft leading to the post, taking care not to slip on the slick metal rungs. At about 100 square feet, the post made me feel as if I were in a rabbit hutch, albeit a large one. It had polystyrene panels covered in flame-retardant white paint on the walls and ceiling and was just big enough to hold the monitoring and communications equipment, including a giant gauge that measured radiation in kilopascals and a two-way land line \u201cteletalk\u201d system, which works sort of like an old-fashioned speakerphone. Mr. Combes and Mr. Russell sometimes fire it up to communicate with other restored posts. After a few minutes my feet became chilled by the cold, damp air that radiated from the concrete floor, over which scraps of carpet had been laid in a futile attempt to help insulate it.After a nuclear blast, one of the three volunteer \u201cobservers\u201d manning the post was to scamper out of the bunker into a likely radiation-contaminated environment, and remove the negatives from a pinhole camera adjacent to the hatch, from which they would be able to help determine the location and type of blast.If a strike was imminent, Mr. Combes said, the observers would sound a hand-operated siren and fire small, flarelike rockets, indicating that people should \u201cget underground or in your basement and stay there until these guys with their measuring equipment detected that the levels of fallout radiation had fallen enough that it was safe to come back above ground and carry on,\u201d he said, making air quotes with his fingers around the word \u201csafe.\u201d Mr. Combes said he\u2019s spoken with dozens of ex-observers, and while they are all proud of their service, some admit the system might have been ineffectual.In addition to hardware, Mr. Combes and Mr. Russell have also provided ephemera like a copy of the Observer\u2019s Handbook and the Official Secrets Acts, as well as decades-old cans of rations labeled \u201cCurried Chicken,\u201d \u201cSteak and Kidney Pudding\u201d and \u201cOatmeal Blocks\u201d that reminded me of the bad-old days of uninspired British cuisine. Near the ladder, a small closet contains a chemical toilet and is stocked with vintage toilet paper, each sheet stamped \u201cGovernment Property.\u201dThe team of volunteers manning the post were required to pass psychological profiling deeming they had the mental makeup for long periods underground in the event of a nuclear war, Mr. Combes said. With five of us in the post for about a half an hour, I could see how being sequestered down there for long stretches could easily drive someone mad, and I had a moment of panic that we\u2019d somehow get stuck down there.I asked Mr. Combes if, when he visits the post, he worries that miscreants will come along and secure the hatch, locking him inside.\u201cEvery time,\u201d he said, without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Sensible Ban on Gun Ads", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn recent years, Facebook has become a thriving marketplace where people buy and sell all kinds of goods and services, including firearms. People often post ads to buy or sell guns on the site and meet in person to complete the transaction. But unlike licensed dealers, private sellers are not required to conduct criminal background checks in most states, and Congress has refused to close this gaping loophole at the federal level.The company has previously banned people from selling prescription drugs on the site, and in 2014 started blocking children\u2019s access to pages advertising guns for sale. It also would send a message to people who posted gun ads to follow the law in their state and country. But those steps did little to stem the trafficking of guns on Facebook. Its new policy to ban all private sales is much more significant. Because its users post so many photos, ads, and other information on its site and Instagram, the company will struggle to weed out all private gun ads. The company will have to rely on its 1.6 billion users to report gun ads to the company. Facebook employees will then have to remove the prohibited ads and pages. In some cases, Facebook might even have to bar some users from its sites if they persist in posting forbidden ads.Of course, Facebook, as big and important as it is, is just one company. There are still many ways for criminals and violent individuals to acquire guns. Only action by Congress can do something about that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Reversal, Egypt Says Terrorists Downed Russian Jet Over Sinai", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byThe authorities made the unexpected admission after strongly urging Egyptians and the world for months to await the results of an international investigation Egypt is leading. The crash dealt a serious blow to Egypt\u2019s vital tourism industry: an important source of hard currency for the country, which relies heavily on imports.Hours after the October downing of the Airbus A321-200, which killed 224 people, Egypt\u2019s local Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility. The group said it had brought down the plane with a bomb concealed in a soda can.The Russian aircraft disintegrated in the air over the Sinai Desert 23 minutes after taking off from the popular Red Sea resort city of Sharm el Sheikh on Oct. 31. The flight was a charter operation by Metrojet, a Russian airline taking its passengers, nearly all of them Russian tourists, to St. Petersburg.Mr. Sisi seemed unusually ill-tempered during much of his speech \u2014 a sharp contrast to the calm, sweet-talking paternal persona he had carved for himself during and after Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, which he led with popular and media support. Mr. Sisi, a former field marshal, warned enemies against exploiting his \u201cpatience and good manners to bring down the state\u201d and vowed to remove those who did \u201coff the face of the Earth.\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t listen to anyone but me,\u201d he told the public, wagging a finger. \u201cI am dead serious. I am not a man who lies or beats around the bush.\u201dVisibly angry, the president went on to painstakingly list the country\u2019s economic woes to his audience, before suggesting that Egyptians donate a pound, about 10 cents, to the government each day to help ease the crisis.At one point, he said he would put himself up for sale to help the economy. \u201cIf it were possible for me to be sold, I would sell myself,\u201d he said.The offer for a \u201cslightly used\u201d former field marshal garnered over $100,000 in bids within a few hours before eBay took down the posting Wednesday afternoon.Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 25 about Egypt\u2019s first acknowledgment that terrorists had downed the Russian jetliner that broke up over the Sinai Peninsula in the fall omitted part of a quotation from President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He said: \u201cThose who downed the flight, what were they hoping for? Just to hit tourism? No, but also to hit relations. To hit relations with Russia, to hit relations with Italy. And if they could with the whole world, they would. So we would be alone and isolated.\u201d While the error was promptly corrected online, editors failed to follow through on this print correction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Ticket to Super Bowl 50? No, Thanks, He\u2019ll Watch at Home", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byCome Sunday, when the Carolina Panthers play the Denver Broncos, Matthews will watch the game on television just like tens of millions of other viewers across the country.As mayor of this city of 120,000 in the heart of Silicon Valley, Matthews, 53, could have used his clout to get a ticket that other fans are spending thousands of dollars to acquire.Instead, he will use a media pass to visit Levi\u2019s Stadium on Sunday morning before the game to thank the operations staff and meet N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. Then he will head home to watch the game with his wife and children.\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know,\u201d he said during an interview in his office before Christmas. \u201cI know nothing about football, I don\u2019t follow the teams, I don\u2019t follow the players, and I have never been to a professional football game, after all this. I am focused completely on the economics of it, including hosting the Super Bowl.\u201dMatthews\u2019s attitude is a stark contrast to some host mayors, who either gush about the N.F.L. as a valued partner or rail against the league for ignoring them.Two years ago, James Cassella, the mayor of East Rutherford, N.J., said his borough was overlooked entirely by officials in New York and New Jersey.Jerry Weiers, the mayor of Glendale, Ariz., criticized state lawmakers a year ago for not helping him pay for the overtime he owed his police officers. The N.F.L. Experience, a giant football-themed amusement park, was in downtown Phoenix, not in Glendale, 20 minutes away.Matthews does not mind that his city, where the game will actually be played, will barely register with many of the hundreds of thousands of fans who have flocked to San Francisco and surrounding cities for the game and festivities beforehand.Santa Clara may receive just a fraction of the estimated $200 million in spending that the Super Bowl is expected to generate in the Bay Area, but the game is still a boon because it has put the city on the national stage and the stadium has attracted billions of dollars of additional investment, he said.\u201cI supported it because of all the good things that have come to pass, not only the revenues generated from the stadium, but all the ancillary benefits,\u201d Matthews said, adding that about $13 billion was being poured into real estate projects in the area around the stadium.With no particular interest in football and subject to term limits that will keep him in office only until 2018, Matthews has no need to cozy up to the N.F.L. In fact, he would probably look out of place at 345 Park Avenue in New York, where the league has its headquarters.A big man in a rumpled suit, Matthews sports Jerry Garcia neckties that his wife buys for him on eBay, as well as bolo ties and occasionally an earring. At a news conference last week, he sat on a stage with the mayors of Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose, who praised him for working cooperatively with their cities and the many agencies that provide services like security and transportation.\u201cThe difference with Santa Clara is they have other jobs,\u201d Jed York, chief executive of the San Francisco 49ers, said of the City Council members. \u201cThe founding fathers set it up where you do this as public service, so they are people who truly care about their community and they are not people doing it as a political career.\u201dMatthews seems at home in his job in part because he has deep roots in the area. He is a fifth-generation Santa Claran, and he said some of his relatives came to California with the ill-fated Donner Party, pioneers who were snowbound in the Sierra Nevada in the winter of 1846-47 and resorted to cannibalism to survive.He played baseball as a child but never football because it conflicted with his time in the marching band. He and his two older brothers, though, watched pro wrestling, imitating their heroes by jumping off the living room sofa.The fascination remained. Matthews calls Hulk Hogan his favorite wrestler, and an enormous WrestleMania poster hangs in his office that shows the Undertaker, a longtime star on the W.W.E. circuit.Matthews became mayor after serving three decades in and around city government, a path that started inauspiciously. A trombonist in the San Jose Symphony, he took a job as a mechanic\u2019s assistant at the police garage in the city because it offered the medical benefits he needed to feel secure enough to ask his girlfriend, Julie, to marry him.For $3.25 an hour, he spent nights fueling, repairing and cleaning cars, trading in a tuxedo for stained blue coveralls. \u201cBasically, I cleaned the vomit out of police cars,\u201d he said.A string of \u201ccharacter-building\u201d jobs followed: cleaning debris out of street sweepers, operating light and heavy equipment, laying asphalt with a road crew and repairing broken sewer lines \u201cwhile the sewage continued to flow,\u201d he said.Having paid his dues, he got a job in the San Jose code enforcement division, which gave him a badge and the task of writing tickets for violations of the city\u2019s rules governing health and safety, sanitation, construction, vending machines and, he added, medical marijuana.Matthews retired as a manager in the code enforcement division last April after 30 years.As he worked his way up the ranks in San Jose, Matthews joined Santa Clara\u2019s planning commission, where he stayed before winning a seat on the City Council in 1998, holding it until 2006, and again from 2008 to 2010.He was elected mayor in November 2014, but because of term limits, he will stay no longer than the end of 2018, a deadline that he said lets him focus on the city, not the politics of the city.\u201cI\u2019ve never been politically ambitious,\u201d said Matthews, who added that when he was out of office from 2006 to 2008, he was relieved to no longer be stopped by concerned citizens at Safeway.While he was on the Council, Santa Clara began discussions with the N.F.L. and the 49ers about the possibility of the team\u2019s building a stadium on an overflow parking lot next to an amusement park. The team had had its practice facilities and offices in Santa Clara for more than 25 years, so a stadium was a logical extension.But the team wanted to see if it could cut a deal with the city of San Francisco first. Ultimately, Santa Clarans passed a measure that gave the city the authority to negotiate a stadium deal with the team as long as it did not affect the city\u2019s general fund or use any tax revenue.Matthews, who calls himself a fiscal conservative and a social liberal, embraced the project because of its long-term benefits. The lure of a pro football stadium in his backyard, though, has not enticed him to start following the N.F.L.\u201cIf they need me, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off.Advertisement"}
