{"Headline": "In Rare Appearance, China\u2019s Central Bank Chief Says All Is Well", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For the second time since last summer, an avuncular, graying man has stepped out of Beijing\u2019s shadows and calmed financial markets after a Chinese devaluation \u2014 but once again, his assurances came after nearly a month of turmoil and growing worry about the country\u2019s economic health.Mixing folksy charm with deft explanations of economic thought, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China\u2019s central bank, held a rare news conference in Shanghai on Friday morning, as finance officials from around the world gathered for the Group of 20 major economies meeting. Mr. Zhou acknowledged worries about spiraling debt at Chinese corporations and local governments but offered reasons why the Chinese economy might be uniquely able to deal with it for the time being.He also dismissed American hedge funds\u2019 concerns about the erosion of China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and assured the audience that China did not plan to further devalue its currency to increase its already formidable export prowess.China\u2019s supply of foreign exchange reserves \u201cis not an oil field with a static stock of oil. It is like water in a reservoir, so there are constant flows in and flows out,\u201d he said.Following Mr. Zhou\u2019s remarks, the Shanghai stock market rebounded 1 percent on Friday, on the heels of a 6.4 percent plunge on Thursday. The value of the renminbi also steadied on Friday in largely unregulated trading in Hong Kong, although it still dipped slightly against the dollar for the day.What Mr. Zhou did not do on Friday, however, was provide any indication of when he might next offer an explanation of Chinese monetary policy. He also did not announce any plans for the People\u2019s Bank of China to follow other leading central banks \u2014 like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan \u2014 in holding regular news briefings after important policy decisions.\u201cIt is very clear that he still does not want to talk too much about policy; he wants to leave it a bit uncertain,\u201d said Zhou Hao, the Asia economist for Commerzbank, who is not related to Zhou Xiaochuan. \u201cFrom China\u2019s perspective, if it\u2019s too transparent, then people will expect too much of you.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In contrast with the central banks of other major economies, China\u2019s central bank is to some extent an advisory body instead of an independent, decision-making institution. The final say on major economic decisions, like interest rate moves or devaluations, belongs to the country\u2019s political leadership.On both occasions, Mr. Zhou said fairly little until the next meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors a month later. The last ministerial meeting was in September in Ankara, Turkey; China holds the group\u2019s presidency this year and chose Shanghai for the gathering on Friday night and Saturday.United States Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew added his voice late Friday afternoon to those calling for China to explain policy changes.\u201cThe exchange rate policy is one in particular that needs to be clearly communicated, and it\u2019s important that as they make their transitions, that they do it in an orderly way,\u201d he told a small group of reporters in Shanghai before a meeting with other finance ministers.Although Mr. Zhou spoke for more than an hour at his news conference on Friday morning in a large, tastefully decorated hall on the fourth floor of the central bank\u2019s Shanghai branch office, he said virtually nothing that would limit the political leadership\u2019s options. He did not, for instance, categorically rule out another decline in the renminbi at some point against the dollar.When one question suggested the renminbi was pegged to a basket of other currencies, Mr. Zhou quickly objected. He said instead that the value of the renminbi would be set \u201cwith reference\u201d to a basket of other currencies \u2014 essentially a weighted average. He preserved even more flexibility for China\u2019s leadership by emphasizing that the renminbi would not be measured against just one basket, but against several.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Mr. Zhou decisively ruled out a depreciation for the purpose of trade advantage, but did not address whether the currency might someday rise or fall for other reasons.\u201cWe will not resort to competitive depreciation so as to boost our advantage in exports,\u201d he said.Mr. Zhou hinted at another Chinese policy effort to strengthen economic growth when he talked about there being room for banks to lend more money for mortgages. Although companies and local governments are heavily in debt, Chinese households generally are not, he noted.The People\u2019s Bank of China recently cut the regulatory minimum for down payments on mortgages to 20 percent of a home\u2019s value, from 30 percent.Mr. Zhou also offered explanations why foreign investors were wrong to worry about China\u2019s rising overall levels of credit, relative to economic output. China has a far higher savings rate than most other economies, so banks have a lot in deposits to lend, he said.China\u2019s stock markets are somewhat small, compared with the size of its economy, forcing companies that need money to rely more on bank loans and bonds, he added. And because China was poor until very recently, many families have not had enough time to accumulate the wealth to start businesses just with their own savings.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lot of accumulation,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to borrow.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Standard Chartered Posts a $2.36 Billion Loss for 2015", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Standard Chartered, an Asia-focused bank based in London, reported on Tuesday an unexpectedly large loss of $2.36 billion for 2015 after being pummeled by its exposure to emerging markets and bad loans.It was the latest in a series of weak performances by global banks, amid concerns over a slowing world economy.Standard Chartered also warned that more than 150 current or former executives were at risk of having their bonuses clawed back if they were found to be responsible for the bank\u2019s poor performance.The bank posted a pretax loss of $1.52 billion for 2015, compared with a pretax profit of $4.24 billion the year before, and it confirmed that it would not pay a final dividend for 2015.The bank has been hit hard by weakness in emerging markets. Its chief financial officer, Andy Halford, said a decline in income had been partly driven by weaknesses in emerging market currencies as well as by a crash in commodity prices. He noted that the bank had reduced its exposure to commodities by 28 percent.Standard Chartered\u2019s operating income was $15.4 billion in 2015, a 15 percent drop from $18.2 billion the year before. Operating expenses were $9 billion in the period, down 7 percent from $9.7 billion in 2014.The bank said its bad loans increased 87 percent, to $4 billion, because of falling commodity prices and a plunge in Indian financial markets.Partly as a result of the sharp increase in bad loans, the bank is carrying out \u201caccountability reviews\u201d on more than 150 current and former executives and may claw back their bonuses, Mr. Winters added in a conference call after the earnings announcement.Standard Chartered\u2019s \u201cexecutive directors have already paid a price for the underperformance,\u201d Mr. Winters said, referring to cuts in bonuses for senior staff members.\u201cApart from that, we have got a quite a robust system of accountability reviews,\u201d Mr. Winters said, warning that bonus clawbacks could come \u201cpending the conclusion of investigations that we\u2019re doing around the real accountability for some of the mistakes that have been made.\u201dStandard Chartered shares in London initially dropped more than 11 percent after the earnings were published, before paring back those losses to close 4 percent lower.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Managers Spot an Opportunity Amid Market Volatility", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byStock markets are plunging. The price of oil is in turmoil. And hedge funds just came off their worst year since the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.But Adam Sender, a well-known collector of contemporary art who shuttered his hedge fund two years ago, just got back into the game. He is bucking the trend at a time when the establishment of new hedge funds is sharply lower than a year ago, according to the data provider Preqin.It may seem like an odd time to be landing investments for new hedge funds, but a handful of big-name managers are hauling in money from investors.Scott Bessent recently left George Soros\u2019s family office to start a $4.5 billion firm called Key Square Group. Eric Cole, a former trader for David Tepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management, has raised about $1 billion for his new firm, Warlander Asset Management.Anil Prasad, a former Citigroup foreign exchange trader, raised nearly $300 million with a co-founder for Silver Ridge Asset Management, regulatory filings show. Even John Paulson, who posted losses in several portfolios in 2015, has raised $600 million for a new distressed fund.These new funds stand in contrast to the rising number of hedge funds \u2014 in particular those that made wrong bets on foreign currencies, central bank interest rate moves and the price of oil \u2014 that are closing their doors to investors and winding down. The pace of hedge fund liquidation picked up in the last quarter of 2015, especially among funds that loaded up on the oil and gas junk bonds that got slammed by the collapse in energy prices.This year has gotten off to an even rougher start for hedge funds: The broadest measure of performance in the nearly $2.9 trillion industry, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, revealed a 1.7 percent decline after falling nearly 1 percent in 2015. The research firm HFR, which compiles the index, said the January performance decline was the worst start for the hedge fund industry since 2008.Yet some of the managers who have waited patiently for years as the stock market hit one new high after another, now sense opportunity in the market turbulence and a chance to make big, bold bets on the volatility in stocks, bonds and commodities.\u201cIt appears a major sea change in the way the markets work may be at hand,\u201d Mr. Sender wrote to investors in January. His new fund, called Global Volatility Voyageur, began trading last month and has taken advantage of volatility in the market, according to someone with knowledge of the firm but not authorized to speak publicly about it.It is Mr. Sender\u2019s first fund since he shut down Exis Capital Management in 2014. At its peak, the fund managed $1 billion, but by the end of 2013 it had under $100 million in assets, after a period of poor performance and redemptions. Mr. Sender\u2019s new fund has a strategy similar to that of Exis. But Mr. Sender, who was an early employee of the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, plans to operate his new firm with about $250 million.Mr. Bessent, who was chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management, told investors in his new firm that the combination of a global slowdown, market anxiety surrounding the Chinese currency and a tumbling stock market made it the perfect time to make money.Key Square Group, the new firm, has made investments in government bonds like United States Treasuries. Mr. Bessent began raising money last fall, but got a big head start when Mr. Soros invested $2 billion of his own money into the upstart firm.Chris Rokos, who co-founded Brevan Howard Asset Management, has raised $3.5 billion for his Rokos Capital Management since it began trading in October. Mr. Rokos left Brevan Howard four years ago and focused on managing a family office before he began raising money from investors last year for a macro hedge fund that makes bets on global economic and political trends.Mr. Cole has raised $1 billion for his new firm, Warlander, which will focus on buying and shorting global credit. Mr. Tepper committed an unspecified sum of money to his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.It is unsurprising that hedge fund managers are looking to start new portfolios in a tough market environment, said Putri Pascualy, a managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management. For traders, a \u201cdislocation means there is a lot of stuff to buy,\u201d she said. This makes sense as long as the upheaval in the stock and bond markets does not signal the start of a severe economic slowdown, Ms. Pascualy said, adding that this was unlikely in her view.Still, some hedge funds continue to get caught in the riptide of volatile markets.A onetime $1 billion structured credit fund operated by Candlewood Investment Group is being wound down and merged into another fund managed by the firm that invests in similar distressed securities, according to a December letter to investors. The New York-based firm has given investors in the Candlewood Structured Credit fund the opportunity to either redeem their money or move it into the firm\u2019s Structured Credit Harvest fund. The portfolio Candlewood is winding down lost 9.4 percent last year.Yet despite these moves, Candlewood has plans to raise money for a new private-equity-style fund that will have a longer holding period for customer money than its hedge fund portfolios.In early January, Nevsky Capital\u2019s $1.5 billion hedge fund announced it was closing, telling investors in a year-end letter that it was getting harder to compete with computer-driven algorithm trading programs.Some of the best-known hedge fund managers, especially those focused on stocks, continue to struggle this year, just as they did in 2015.William Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Holdings has told investors it is down 18.6 percent so far this year after posting a 21 percent decline in 2015. A large portfolio managed by Larry Robbins\u2019s Glenview Capital Management was down 13.6 percent at the end of January, after falling just over 18 percent last year, according to an HSBC hedge fund report. Leon Cooperman\u2019s Omega Advisors which lost about 10 percent last year is off to a rough start again, sliding another 10 percent during the first month of this year, according to the same HSBC report.Among some investors, however, the steady flow of hedge fund pitches may fall on deaf ears as long the markets continue to plunge \u2014 especially pitches from managers with limited track records.\u201cYoung portfolio managers may be disappointed in the reception they receive in this environment,\u201d said Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer at the private wealth management firm Offit Capital Advisors. Most investors these days, \u201chave higher priorities\u201d than researching new opportunities, he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Much of Your Nest Egg to Put Into Stocks? All of It", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byRetiringLET\u2019S say you were persuaded by my argument in last week\u2019s Retiring column \u2014 contrary to the advice offered by most financial experts \u2014 that you should not reduce your exposure to the stock market as you grow older. Or you\u2019re at least willing to listen to this contrarian advice.But now what? Whatever your age, how much of your investments should be in equities? Should it be 30 percent? 60 percent? 90 percent?No less an authority than Warren E. Buffett has stated that 90 percent is the right answer. That\u2019s a level of investment in stocks that many investors, not just older ones, find dangerously uncomfortable, particularly when the stock market is as volatile as it has been lately. Yet Mr. Buffett, the most renowned investor of our time, established a trust for his wife that puts 10 percent of his bequest in short-term government bonds with the remainder invested in a broad-based stock index fund.But even Mr. Buffett\u2019s advice may be too conservative. Indeed \u2014 except for known, near-term financial obligations like a large tax bill that you might owe on April 15 or a down payment on a house you\u2019re buying in the next few months \u2014 the best asset allocation, nearly all the time, is 100 percent stocks.You may wonder if I put my money where my mouth is. I do. As long ago as the late 1970s, I was investing 95 percent to 100 percent of my liquid assets in common stocks. This didn\u2019t change even when I ran the bond department at my old firm during the 1980s. And it remains true today.If one of my clients happened to ask me what I thought their proper asset allocation should be, I would tell them that, despite my job, I was almost 100 percent invested in stocks myself. I even suggested that they take away the money we were managing and turn it over to our firm\u2019s equity money managers.Many investors simply cannot stomach the volatility that a 100 percent equity portfolio entails. Perhaps that is why Mr. Buffett tempers his advice and suggests \u201conly\u201d 90 percent stocks. (In his heart of hearts, I suspect, Mr. Buffett is probably a 100 percent kinda guy.)And, so, what I actually say to people who ask my advice is this: Put as much money into the stock market as you can stand. One hundred percent is best, but even if you are very risk-averse, allocate at least 75 percent to stocks.There are reams of data showing the superior performance of the stock market over many generations. In the last 90 years, according to Morningstar, stocks have outperformed long-term Treasury bonds, on average, by 4.4 percentage points a year. They have done even better against intermediate- and short-term Treasuries, 4.8 and 6.6 percentage points.That kind of performance edge (compounded) really adds up. Let\u2019s say you invest some money in stocks halfway through your working career (say, at age 45) and spend those particular savings halfway through your retirement (say, at age 75). If your investment does 4.4 percentage points better per year than the next person\u2019s, you will have more than three and one half times as much money to spend as they will.Looking at rolling 30-year periods, stocks have always outperformed Treasury bills and intermediates, and have only rarely underperformed long-term Treasuries. Even for periods as short as five years, stocks have done better than the various fixed-income categories 71 to 76 percent of the time.Of course, \u201cpast performance,\u201d as we are constantly reminded, \u201cis not necessarily indicative of future results.\u201d And that\u2019s true: For a variety of reasons, I believe you should not expect a broad portfolio of stocks to outperform bonds by as much in the future as they have in the past.He was exaggerating to make his point \u2014 countering those who would claim they have a large and statistically unassailable sample size simply because they have 90 years of consistently superior stock market performance. All that data, after all, covers only 15 business cycles, merely three generations and as Professor Samuelson said, just \u201cone history of modern capitalism.\u201dSo, is there some other justification besides the reams of data? Are there sound reasons to believe that it is necessarily true that stocks will win over the next generation and the one after that? Yes.My argument for full equity exposure rests not only on their historical and empirical superiority but their logical superiority. Consider this:\u25a0 Money invested in a United States total stock index fund will be used to buy shares of thousands of companies in dozens of industries. At this writing, every $2 million represents an ownership interest of approximately one ten-millionth of almost the entire United States economy.\u25a0 Economic potential never drops because knowledge \u2014 the main source of per capita growth \u2014 always rises. Technology (knowledge embedded in machines) gets better because we invest in research and development and never (at least intentionally) replace a good machine with an inferior one. Moreover, the capability of the average worker (knowledge embedded in our brains) keeps rising because average educational and training levels continue to rise.\u25a0 As a consequence, the intrinsic value of your equity investments rises over time. This isn\u2019t true for every single company, but it is surely true for all companies taken collectively.The economy, of course, does not grow every quarter or year. Just six and a half years ago, we emerged from the 11th recession since World War II. But the potential of the economy always grows, which is why after virtually every recession, the economy attains heights never reached before.To be sure, the path of equity market valuation is far more erratic than the economy \u2014 stocks often require a number of stock market cycles to attain new inflation-adjusted highs \u2014 but the long-term trend is inevitably rising.Inevitable? O.K., perhaps I\u2019m exaggerating a bit. None of this has to happen. Theoretically, we could (collectively) choose to substitute inferior technologies for superior ones. Inferior technologies sometimes \u201cwin\u201d because of superior marketing (think V.H.S. vs. Betamax), but that is the rare exception, not the rule.It is also plausible, given that American educational levels are so high, that they could stop improving, or even slip. But that is not really conceivable on a worldwide basis \u2014 at least for many generations \u2014 since the developing world is so far behind.But what if the absolute worst happened? A pandemic of epic proportions, a nuclear holocaust or the Earth is hit by an asteroid?Yes, your stocks will collapse but your bonds will be worthless, too. If there is no functioning modern economy, the government will not be able to pay its debts. And if you\u2019re still around, you\u2019ll have bigger things to worry about.The upshot is this: Both the historical record and logic argue very strongly for stocks over bonds. Yes, stocks are more volatile, but if you recognize that the \u201cinvestment horizon\u201d is always long and always receding into the future, your best bet is to put virtually all of your liquid assets into the stock market.David A.

{"Headline": "Battered Bank Stocks Reflect Not Just Jitters, but Mistrust", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe bear market in big United States financial stocks has many people wondering: Are we headed for another banking crisis?The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 money-center institutions and top regional banks, certainly signals pain for this industry. The index has tumbled 19 percent this year and 26 percent since its peak in July.Some individual stocks have fared even worse. In recent days, shares of Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have hit 52-week lows. Bank of America has lost around 29 percent and Citi around 27 percent, year to date, while JPMorgan is down 13 percent.Clearly, the decline in bank shares reflects turmoil in the commodities markets, the economic downturn in China and renewed banking troubles in Europe. How much these woes will damage big banks\u2019 balance sheets and income statements remains uncertain.Investors seem to believe steep loan losses lie ahead. This message comes through loud and clear when you compare some banks\u2019 market capitalizations with their book values, or their net worths. When investors anticipate loan losses, they price bank shares below their corresponding book values.That uncomfortable position is where some of the nation\u2019s largest banks currently stand. For example, Citigroup shares are trading at 61 percent of its tangible book value, a measure of a bank\u2019s equity that excludes items that are difficult to assess, like good will. And Bank of America stock trades at 75 percent of its tangible book value, down from a slight premium late last year. Even the mighty JPMorgan trades at 19 percent above its tangible book; at year\u2019s end, the stock represented a 38 percent premium.Investors clearly expect loan losses at these institutions to mount. But they have also been rattled by the possibility that the United States might experience negative interest rates like those found in Japan. Such rates would drive down banks\u2019 profit margins, a reversal from the previously accepted view that banks\u2019 margins would increase this year as the Federal Reserve Board raised rates.This is a relatively new fear; few bank analysts have cut this year\u2019s earnings estimates for the sector.Now, however, Mr. Peabody says the selling in some big banks\u2019 shares has been overdone. While he foresees declining earnings at these institutions this year and next, he said he did not expect the level of loan losses that the stocks are signaling.For the banks, Mr. Peabody said in an interview, \u201cthe losses aren\u2019t going to be such that they can\u2019t absorb them in the norm of their earnings streams.\u201dThat means the discounts to book values have grown too large. \u201cI think the U.S. banks will come out of this downturn with their book values actually growing somewhat,\u201d Mr. Peabody said.So why have bank shares continued to fall? Mr. Peabody contended that excess selling pressure was a result of investors being forced to unwind big bets made in these stocks last year when it was widely believed that interest rates would rise and fuel bank profits.\u201cYou had huge money flows into dedicated bank stock funds \u2014 they doubled in size from $1 billion to $2 billion last year,\u201d Mr. Peabody said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re having now is a mechanical margin call by these funds, creating selling that has nothing to do with the fundamentals.\u201d\u201cAny number of statistics would validate the fact that banks today don\u2019t have the risks they had either in 1990 or 2008,\u201d Mr. Bove said, recalling two of the worst periods for banks in recent history. \u201cThe stocks are selling at such deep discounts to book value that they are telling you the book values are not valid.\u201dThis view, which Mr. Bove does not agree with, reflects investors\u2019 severe mistrust of both the banks and their regulators, he said. After instituting hundreds of new rules to strengthen the banking system and protect against disastrous losses, regulators have still not convinced investors that these institutions are sound.\u201cNobody believes that the industry has changed,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cNobody believes that what the government has done has been effective.\u201dBank investors have good reason to be doubters. In the years leading to the financial crisis, regulators repeatedly stated that subprime mortgage losses would not be large enough to harm the overall economy. (Remember all the references to the subprime problem being \u201ccontained?\u201d) Then, in the aftermath of the mess, investors learned the hard way about losses at these institutions that far exceeded their reserves.The current psychology \u201cis you can\u2019t believe anything the government says because the government is not prone to telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t believe anything the banks say because we know they\u2019ve lied to us repeatedly.\u201dThis view represents a \u201cmassive failure of government regulation,\u201d Mr. Bove recently told his clients. Investors don\u2019t believe central bankers are effective and they fret that bank balance sheets are \u201cblack boxes.\u201dAfter a recent in-depth analysis of balance sheets, Mr. Bove concluded that banks are far safer than investors seem to think.The only thing that could really wreck banks\u2019 financial positions is \u201ca recession that is as bad as 2008,\u201d Mr. Bove contended. \u201cForget all the other stuff \u2014 consumer loan losses will shake the banks and will cause banks to run into negative earnings.\u201d Mr. Bove is not forecasting such an event.Our nation\u2019s top financial regulators and its big bank managers must be frustrated by the deep skepticism investors hold toward them and their work. But the financial crisis destroyed much of the trust earned by these institutions over the years. Eight years later, investors seem to be telling them, \u201cYou have yet to win it back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulators Aren\u2019t Done With \u2018Dark Pool\u2019 Investigations", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byAt the heart of the cases are so-called dark pools, a nefarious-sounding term for an activity that actually plays a big role in the way equities markets work. About 42 percent of the average daily trade volume is handled in the \u201cdark,\u201d according to the Tabb Group, a data and research firm. That means no information about the trades is known publicly before they are executed.Conversely, 58 percent of an average day\u2019s trades are done on the \u201clit,\u201d or public, markets like the major United States stock exchanges, where transactions can be seen by brokers and other market dealers before they are completed. The Tabb Group says last year\u2019s overall average daily trade volume (both lit and dark) was 6.9 billion shares a day.Firms like Barclays and Credit Suisse operate dark pools for customers who want to buy and sell stock without other traders finding out what they are up to before a transaction takes place. These types of dark pools handle 13.6 percent of daily trading, the Tabb Group says.A pension fund with a large block of stock to sell, for example, would want that transaction to be handled as confidentially as possible to avoid affecting the price of the shares until all or most of them could be unloaded.Although dark pools have existed for decades, they have become more popular in recent years as high-speed electronic trading has ruled the markets. Supersophisticated computers can search various public exchanges in fractions of a second, ferreting out trades from the moment they are initiated until they are completed. That ability has enabled competing buyers and sellers to react to the trades while they are in progress.In Credit Suisse\u2019s instance, information about customer orders sitting in its dark pool waiting to be completed was sent to its smart-order router and another router designed to detect interest from other traders.That information \u201cleakage\u201d is what dark pools are supposed to guard against.The Barclays and Credit Suisse settlements, totaling $154.3 million, are the largest to date.At a news conference on Monday, both Andrew J. Ceresney, the S.E.C\u2019s director of enforcement, and Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, said other investigations were continuing. The two jointly announced the Barclays and Credit Suisse settlements. New York first sued Barclays over issues regarding its dark pool in 2014.\u201cThis is an area where both of our institutions are focused,\u201d Mr. Ceresney said.For its part, while it admitted violations of securities laws in settling its case, Barclays got approval for waivers that would preserve its status as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which means it benefits from a streamlined process for filing securities registrations. Without the waivers, it could have been classified an \u201cineligible issuer,\u201d which is the status conferred to companies with black marks against them.Advertisement"}

Most sectors \u2014 from consumption and housing investment to exports \u2014 deteriorated.The decline in Japan\u2019s gross domestic product was the second in three quarters, and was sharper than most private sector economists had forecast. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a contraction of 0.8 percent, on average.With concerns about the health of the global economy sending shudders though the financial markets, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing what may be the toughest test yet of his three-year-old campaign to lift Japanese growth rates and end two decades of deflation.One crucial pillar of that campaign \u2014 a weaker currency \u2014 has lately begun to crack. The yen dropped by about 40 percent against the dollar from the time Mr. Abe took office in late 2012 until the end of last year, as the Japanese central bank carried out an aggressive program of monetary stimulus.The devaluation of the yen enriched automakers and other big companies that earn most of their revenues abroad, and sent the Japanese stock market soaring. It helped nudge consumer prices higher, too, another central goal of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic agenda, known as Abenomics.But since late last year, a flight to safe assets by global investors has reversed the yen\u2019s direction. Stocks have tumbled \u2014 the Nikkei 225 average lost 12 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Inflation has slipped back to around zero.In response, the central bank \u2014 the Bank of Japan \u2014 announced last month that it would take the unusual step of cutting its benchmark interest rate below zero, joining a group of European countries that are also struggling with deflation.The Nikkei surged more than 5 percent in early trading on Monday despite the gloomy economic report, possibly reflecting a slight easing in the yen after Asian markets closed on Friday.Mr. Abe\u2019s governing coalition faces an election for the upper house of Parliament this summer. Analysts and advisers say he has been counting on public support for his economic policies to extend the coalition\u2019s majority there. The strategy now looks less bankable, though it is unclear whether Japan\u2019s weak collection of opposition parties can capitalize on any voter backlash.For all of 2015, the Japanese economy eked out growth of 0.4 percent, the government data released on Monday showed.Japanese G.D.P. data are often subject to sharp future revisions. The low growth rate, meanwhile, means those changes can easily make the difference between an economy that appears to be growing and one that is shrinking. Last quarter, for instance, the government initially said the economy was in recession, having contracted for two straight quarters, only to declare a few weeks later that output had actually grown.Even so, the economic contraction measured by the government\u2019s data on Monday took place as the recent financial market turmoil was only beginning. Should the volatility continue, analysts say, Japan could fall into recession for real this time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Robots Are Coming for Wall Street", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueHundreds of financial analysts are being replaced with software. What office jobs are next?Supported byNadler couldn\u2019t have double-checked all this analysis if he wanted to. It was based on thousands of numbers drawn from dozens of databases. He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand.

{"Headline": "Trial Illuminates Porsches\u2019 Rise to Power at Volkswagen", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A criminal trial in Germany has shed new light on how a billionaire family acquired ultimate power at Volkswagen in the years leading up to the carmaker\u2019s emissions-cheating crisis.Two former top managers of the Porsche family holding company \u2014 as part of one of the more spectacular financial maneuvers of the last decade \u2014 are accused of manipulating Volkswagen\u2019s share price in 2008, according to evidence presented in the trial. On paper, at least, Volkswagen briefly became the most valuable company in the world.The Porsche family went on to become Volkswagen\u2019s majority shareholders. Prosecutors say the maneuver was part of a carefully planned takeover of Volkswagen that was even given an internal code name, \u201cProject Bavaria.\u201d In its aftermath, a German billionaire committed suicide, plagued by losses.The fund, one of the largest investors in the world, has a 1.2 percent stake in VW valued at $1.3 billion.Documents related to the trial, some not previously available to the public, suggest that in 2008 the Porsche family could easily have lost its grip on Volkswagen, which it was trying to acquire. Volkswagen might have been taken over by a rival car company instead, or perhaps it would have more independent shareholders. But favorable share price movements \u2014 a result of illegal market manipulation, according to prosecutors \u2014 rescued the family fortune and paved the way for it to acquire a majority in Volkswagen.Some analysts say Volkswagen\u2019s shortage of independent shareholder oversight \u2014 88 percent of all shares today are held by just three investors: the Porsche family (just over 50 percent), the Qatar government (17 percent) and the German state of Lower Saxony (20 percent) \u2014 could have created an atmosphere conducive to fraud because there were not enough critical voices on the board.The emissions crisis \u201chighlights serious corporate governance problems at Volkswagen,\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a report this month. \u201cThese deficiencies include ineffective internal controls to uncover improper activity and poor risk management by VW\u2019s management and supervisory boards.\u201dThe fallout from the emissions crisis includes investigations in Germany, the United States and other countries, as well as lawsuits by shareholders and owners of Volkswagen diesel cars.A central contention of the criminal trial, taking place at a state court in Stuttgart, is that two top officials at a Porsche family holding company set out to manipulate VW\u2019s stock price to avert a decline that could have severely diminished the family\u2019s wealth.No Porsche family members are charged with crimes. Representatives of the family say the holding company, known as Porsche SE, had 3 billion euros in cash available in October 2008 and was not under threat. \u201cThe liquidity situation of Porsche SE was completely different than it has been portrayed by the state\u2019s attorney,\u201d Porsche SE said on Friday in response to questions.\u201cThe second maintains,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00ebch continued. \u201cMy generation is the third. We normally destroy. In 2008, we almost did.\u201dProsecutors in the current case are scheduled to summarize their case on Thursday. A verdict by a panel of judges is expected by the end of the month.The trial revolves around a few turbulent days in October 2008, soon after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers propelled financial markets globally into chaos.Volkswagen shares were losing value fast. Speculators, anticipating a rout, swooped in and began betting that VW\u2019s price would fall further by using a risky short-selling strategy in which investors sell borrowed shares in anticipation of buying them back later, at a lower price, and pocketing the difference. Compounding the risk, some sold shares that they hadn\u2019t actually borrowed \u2014 a \u201cnaked\u201d short that makes it even tougher to cover the bet later.On Oct. 26, 2008, a Sunday, the Porsche holding company (which at the time owned Porsche the sports-car maker) issued a statement that German prosecutors now say was an attempt to mislead investors and prop up sagging Volkswagen shares. In the statement, Porsche disclosed that it owned 42.6 percent of Volkswagen voting shares outright and options equal to another 31.5 percent. In other words, Porsche had already locked up 74.1 percent of Volkswagen shares and was close to its goal of acquiring the 75 percent needed to control the company under German law.It was no secret by then that Porsche was trying to take over Volkswagen and had acquired a sizable bloc of shares, as well as options. Porsche was eager to protect its relationship with Volkswagen, which helped manufacture highly profitable Porsche cars like the Cayenne sport utility vehicle.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But the size of the options position came as a shock to the investors betting that the stock would fall. They realized that if VW had locked up so many shares, relatively few were still up for grabs.The hedge funds suddenly needed to settle their short-sale bets, which required them to own Volkswagen shares. The Porsche statement left them with the impression that there weren\u2019t enough available to buy, a situation known as a short squeeze.Prosecutors say the market panic was unwarranted. Porsche was on the verge of running out of cash it needed to sustain the options play, according to prosecutors, and soon would have been forced to dump millions of shares on the market.According to prosecutors, Porsche\u2019s financial distress stemmed from the agreement it had made with Maple Bank, a niche investment bank that handled the options trades.If Volkswagen shares fell below certain benchmarks, Porsche was obligated to post cash security with Maple Bank. The more the shares fell, the more Porsche had to pay.By Oct. 24, 2008, Porsche had already had to post \u20ac4.3 billion and was down to its last \u20ac326 million, according to the indictment. If the shares rose, on the other hand, Porsche would get the money back and the pressure would ease.The Oct. 26 news release gave no indication that the company was in a tight spot. Prosecutors contend that the omission of that crucial information misled investors and amounted to a criminal violation of German securities laws.Lawyers for Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter argue that they could not have known what the market reaction to the Oct. 26 statement would be. They argue that Porsche still had enough cash to fulfill its obligations. The lawyers also say that Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter were open about Porsche\u2019s intentions.\u201cEverything was always communicated correctly,\u201d Mr. Wiedeking said in a statement to the court. \u201cThere was never any talk that Maple was going to quit the options strategy.\u201dMartin Weimann, a Berlin lawyer who is president of a shareholder-advocacy group, said the Stuttgart trial exposed the weakness of investor protections under German law. \u201cGermany runs the risk of looking like a banana republic,\u201d Mr. Weimann said in an email. International investors, he said, \u201chave already taken note of how long the case has taken to process and what a small role the rights of damaged capital-market participants play.\u201dUltimately, Porsche\u2019s takeover of Volkswagen failed, at least on paper. Instead, Volkswagen went on to buy Porsche.But the deal left the Porsche family, via its holding company, with more than half of VW\u2019s voting shares. In effect, the Porsche family traded a niche sports car maker for a majority stake in the world\u2019s second-largest carmaker, after Toyota.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In College Endowment Returns, Davids Beat the Goliaths", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseIn the world of money management, bigger is often considered better. College and university endowments greater than $1 billion, for example, have long outperformed their smaller rivals.That may be changing.Even more surprising, the top-performing endowments over 10 years among all schools reporting data weren\u2019t giants like Harvard and Stanford or even Yale, known for its pioneering \u201cYale method\u201d \u2014 investing in so-called alternative assets like hedge funds and private equity rather than just stocks and bonds. The Nacubo-Commonfund study does not publicly disclose the identities of schools in the rankings, but people who know the results told me the top-performing colleges are two Virginia universities whose financial resources amount to a negligible fraction of the typical Ivy League endowment.Radford University, which ranked first, has an endowment of $55.5 million, and Southern Virginia University, which was second, has an endowment of just $1.1 million. (Taken together, that\u2019s 0.15 percent of Harvard\u2019s endowment, the largest in the country, which is $37.6 billion.)It\u2019s as if Lebanon Valley College, the smallest school (enrollment 425) ever to reach the Sweet 16 (in 1953), were to win an N.C.A.A. basketball championship.The giant endowments still lead over 10 years, with annualized returns of 7.2 percent compared with 6 percent for the smallest endowments. But the gap is narrowing.Both Radford and Southern Virginia \u2014 which, coincidentally, are 90 miles from each other in southwest Virginia \u2014 have weathered good and bad markets, including the financial crisis and the recent bull market. Radford\u2019s annualized 10-year return is 12.4 percent, and Southern Virginia\u2019s is 11.2 percent. For the most recent fiscal year, 2015, Radford earned over 13 percent and Virginia Southern\u2019s return was 10.5 percent. The average return last year for all endowments was just 2.4 percent.Southern Virginia achieved those results by investing in individual stocks and low-cost index funds. It has no exposure to so-called alternative investments \u2014 expensive hedge funds, private equity and venture capital funds. Indeed, the main reason the smallest endowments have been catching up to the biggest funds is that most of them \u2014 like most individual investors \u2014 can\u2019t afford or get access to most alternative strategies.Radford is something of an anomaly, since 80 percent of its endowment is co-invested with a fellow Virginia institution, the much wealthier University of Richmond. But Radford has significantly outperformed Richmond, which, like other $1 billion-plus endowments, has a large allocation to alternative investments.According to the latest Nacubo-Commonfund study, hedge funds, private equity and other alternative strategies make up a record 57 percent of the assets held by endowments over $1 billion, and just 11 percent for endowments under $25 million.The largest endowments continue to plow money into these alternative assets, even though many of them have consistently underperformed stock market indexes like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index or a simple mix of stocks and bonds. Last year, hedge funds lost 0.85 percent on average, according to the research firm HFR. The S.&P. did slightly better, declining 0.73 percent. Including dividends, the index gained 1.2 percent.The biggest endowments have long maintained that their size and prestige give them access to the top-performing hedge funds, private equity managers and venture firms, something that smaller schools can\u2019t replicate. That may still be the case, but the success of small endowments like Southern Virginia\u2019s suggest that they can outperform even their largest and most prestigious rivals by sticking to lower-cost strategies.\u201cI\u2019ve thought about alternatives, but I\u2019m not that interested,\u201d said Jesse Seegmiller, who is both the controller and chief investment officer at Southern Virginia in Buena Vista, Va. \u201cI have problems with even calling alternatives an investment class. There\u2019s really only equities and debt \u2014 everything else is a subset of those.\u201dHe added: \u201cCommodities, real estate, they may act differently, but they\u2019re really equities. When someone tells me they\u2019re 60 percent in alternatives, it really doesn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201dSouthern Virginia was once a private women\u2019s college, best known for its equestrian program. In its heyday in the 1960s, the school won many national riding titles. But like many women\u2019s colleges, it struggled, even after admitting men in the 1990s. In 1996, after losing its accreditation, the school was revived as a liberal arts college by members of the Mormon Church. Today the school describes its mission as serving the \u201ccommunity of Latter Day Saints,\u201d although it welcomes \u201call who share our values\u201d and is not affiliated with the Mormon Church. Its enrollment is just over 700 students.As a matter of policy, tuition is relatively low (for a private college) at $14,900 a year, so many costs are covered by annual giving. Unlike many schools with larger endowments, which typically spend 5 percent of the endowment value each year, Southern Virginia doesn\u2019t draw on its endowment to fund current operations, which Mr. Seegmiller sees as an advantage.\u201cWe can take a very long-term view,\u201d he said. The school\u2019s asset allocation is 80 percent equities and 20 percent cash and fixed income, a relatively aggressive concentration in more volatile but higher-return equities, which has paid off during the bull market that began in 2009.A native New Yorker whose nomadic career has taken him from Citigroup to the Maine Public Utilities Commission to Singapore and then to St. George, Utah, Mr. Seegmiller was looking to buy a business in Virginia when he dropped by to see Southern Virginia and ended up staying. (Both he and his wife are Mormons.) He took over the endowment in 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis. Fortunately for the school, most of its endowment then was in certificates of deposit. Mr. Seegmiller moved into equities, which \u201cwas a no-brainer time to invest in stocks,\u201d he said.Southern Virginia\u2019s endowment is unusual among small endowments in that it does not rely on outside advisers. For exposure to bonds and international stocks, the school uses low-cost exchange-traded funds. For United States stocks, Mr. Seegmiller chooses individual securities, aiming for a relatively concentrated portfolio of 15 to 20 stocks.\u201cI like to concentrate on my best ideas.\u201d he said. He subscribes to the \u201cgrowth at a reasonable price\u201d philosophy, which has led him to positions in Apple and Gilead Sciences. Among his biggest gains are Gilead, Tractor Supply, LKQ Corporation, FactSet Research Systems and Roper Technologies.Radford is a public state university with an enrollment of just under 10,000 students whose endowment is overseen by a private foundation with its own board and investment committee. Since 2009, the foundation has outsourced most of the endowment management to Spider Management, which is the investment office for the University of Richmond and a few other nonprofits.The foundation directly invests 20 percent of the endowment\u2019s assets, and a committee of students with faculty oversight invests a smaller portion of the endowment, currently more than $1 million.By piggybacking on Richmond\u2019s $2.3 billion endowment, Radford has a substantial position in alternative assets. But Richmond\u2019s endowment return for the 2015 fiscal year was 6.3 percent \u2014 less than half of Radford\u2019s \u2014 and its annualized 10-year return is 9.7 percent. John Cox, executive director of the Radford Foundation, attributed the difference to the 20 percent directly managed by the foundation, which posted very strong returns last year thanks to \u201csome additional unique private investments,\u201d Mr. Cox said, without identifying them.Whether Radford and Southern Virginia can hold on to their top rankings remains to be seen, given this year\u2019s treacherous markets, but they\u2019ve already demonstrated that small size is no obstacle to superior performance. And Southern Virginia proves that exotic and costly alternative strategies don\u2019t necessarily produce better results than a simple focus on low-cost stocks and bonds.Maybe one day we\u2019ll be reading about the Southern Virginia model.Advertisement"}

Gold rose to $1,247.90 an ounce, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.66 percent, from 1.67 on Wednesday.The move by the Swedish central bank was intended to counter the dual threat of deflation and an appreciating currency, which poses a threat to the country\u2019s export-driven economy.But many investors saw the rate cut as smacking of desperation and the latest sign that global central bankers are moving toward a round of competitive devaluations \u2014 also known as currency wars \u2014 as a way to stimulate their economies.\u201cWhat central bankers are doing now feels like a Jedi trick,\u201d said Albert Edwards, global strategist for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London. \u201cEveryone is in a currency war and inflation expectations are collapsing.\u201dIn other words, drastic steps by central bankers in Europe, Japan and China to keep their currencies weak and exports strong may not only be counterproductive in terms of stimulating global growth \u2014 someone has to buy all those Chinese and Japanese goods \u2014 but has other consequences as well.Negative interest rates, for example, are not only bad for bank profits and lending prospects, they can also make savers more fearful, hampering the central aim, which is to get people to spend, not hoard.All of which can lead to a global recession.A perma-bear like Mr. Edwards is always in possession of a multitude of negative economic indicators to prove his thesis, which, in his case, is a fall of 75 percent in the S.&P. 500 from its peak last summer.Some are obvious and have been highlighted by most economists, like the increasing interest rates on corporate bonds in the United States \u2014 both investment grade and junk.But he also pointed to a recent release from the Fed that showed that loan officers at United States banks said that they had been tightening their loan standards for two consecutive quarters.\u201cYou tend to see that in a recession,\u201d Mr. Edwards said.His prediction of a so-called deflationary ice age is still considered a fringe view of sorts, although he did say that a record 950 people (up from 700 the year before) attended his annual conference in London last month.Still, the notion that the global economy has not responded as it should to years of shock policies from central banks is more or less mainstream economic thinking right now.Within the International Monetary Fund, which has been regularly downgrading global forecasts over the last year, economists have begun to express concern that the growth problems of large emerging markets like China, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa are going to persist for the long term.Increasing levels of debt and the inability of governments in these countries to put in place long-lasting reforms, especially at the private sector level, will keep growth rates much lower than they should be.That could mean that this convergence with developed economies that emerging market bulls have long predicted could face quite a long delay and perhaps, in some cases, not even materialize.The well-known bond investor William H. Gross of Janus Capital took up this theme in his latest investment essay, arguing that there was no evidence to show that the financial wealth (and increased levels of debt) created by a long period of extra-low interest rates would spur growth in the real economy.As proof, he cited Japan\u2019s persistent struggles to grow despite near-zero interest rates; subpar growth in the United States; and emerging market problems in China, Brazil and Venezuela.\u201cThere is a lot of risk in the global financial marketplace,\u201d Mr. Gross said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIt is incumbent on me to focus on safe assets now.\u201dFor the time being at least, investors seem to agree. Over the last few days they have been pouring money into exchange-traded funds that track gold stocks and United States Treasury bills.Riskier securities like emerging market stocks; European banks, where fears over bad loans are growing; and high-yield corporate bonds have suffered.Low oil prices, cheap Chinese exports and negative interest rates may smell like recession to some, but economists with a more optimistic bent see these trends as a tremendous gift to the consumer.Charles Dumas, the chief economist for Lombard Street, an independent research house based in London says that consumers in Europe and the United States will not hoard their gains but instead spend them on houses, cars and other items.\u201cThis idea that consumers are not spending is just wide of the mark,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. Perhaps the full effect won\u2019t be felt immediately, he added, but over time it will.The world\u2019s central bankers certainly hope he is right.Advertisement"}

But all good \u2013 or less bad \u2013 things must come to an end, and many are encouraging investors to prepare for a shift in leadership and a prolonged period of relative strength overseas.\u201cIn the rest of 2016 you\u2019re going to have lots of opportunities in foreign markets, more than in the U.S.,\u201d said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consultancy. \u201cForeign markets have had better valuations, and they\u2019re correcting much more sharply.\u201dFundamental factors like the interest-rate policies of central banks also could make prospects more favorable for foreign stocks. The Federal Reserve just raised rates for the first time since before the financial crisis and signaled that it would do so four more times this year, although Wall Street is skeptical that domestic economic growth will warrant such aggressive credit-tightening. Other central banks, meanwhile, are headed the opposite way.\u201cMonetary policy and business-cycle differences play in favor of international markets,\u201d said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank. \u201cCentral banks in the eurozone and Japan are easing. More than easing in the eurozone; they\u2019re catching up to where the U.S. was four years ago.\u201dThe European Central Bank has been especially loose with credit as it tries to undo the damage caused by its earlier reluctance to match the Fed\u2019s efforts to flood the financial system with money. The Fed\u2019s quantitative easing program \u2013 purchases of Treasury bonds and other instruments \u2013 ended last year.Mr. Wieting encourages investing in Europe and oil importers like Japan that benefit from depressed prices.

In fact, he\u2019s looking forward to it.\u201cI was negative on emerging markets for quite a while, but with things falling apart, I\u2019m getting superoptimistic,\u201d he said. He sees those markets, and markets dominated by commodity producers, reaching the capitulation stage, where downturns have gone on for so long and prospects look so bleak that investors just give up. That\u2019s often when a lasting low occurs.His advice is to invest gradually in diversified baskets of emerging markets and commodities, either directly or through shares of companies that produce them, over the next six months, feeding in the same dollar amount at regular intervals.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a terrific pick beginning in March,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted. \u201cThe timing could not be better, especially in emerging markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Xiao Gang, China\u2019s Top Securities Regulator, Ousted Over Market Tumult", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s top securities regulator, Xiao Gang, has been forced out, the official Xinhua News Agency announced on Saturday, after facing stinging criticism for amplifying the country\u2019s stock market turbulence.The move reflects the increasing pressure on the Chinese leadership to bolster confidence at home, as questions mount about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the economy, the currency and the markets.Just days ago, Prime Minister Li Keqiang castigated the country\u2019s financial regulators for their handling of a steep plunge in stocks since last June and an erosion in the value of China\u2019s currency.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, led by Mr. Xiao, 57, has taken a big dose of blame for the problems.He attracted significant criticism for allowing a speculative bubble to form, in which share prices more than doubled in a year. When it burst last summer, those shares gave up all of their gains, hurting millions of families who had borrowed heavily to buy stocks.As stocks sank, the regulator also intensified the market mayhem. Two measures, intended to stabilize stocks, have been widely blamed for producing a weeklong rout in China\u2019s stock markets during the first week of January that unsettled investors around the world.Mr. Xiao defended himself in a long statement on his agency\u2019s website in mid-January, analyzing the causes of his country\u2019s recent financial sector difficulties. He said the turbulence in China\u2019s markets, including another nose dive in share prices last summer, was partly caused by the inexperience of investors and the immaturity of the local market.But he also conceded that recent troubles reflected an \u201cimperfect trading system, flawed market mechanisms and inappropriate supervision systems,\u201d together with an exodus of seasoned personnel from his agency.Mr. Xiao, who also lost his post as the regulator\u2019s Communist Party leader, will be succeeded as chairman and party leader by Liu Shiyu, 54, chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China and a former deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, according to the news agency.Mr. Liu was trained in engineering at Tsinghua University, but started a career in the state banking sector in the 1980s, according to the news agency.His task will not be an easy one.Anticorruption investigators have been scrutinizing the agency, trying to ascertain whether staff members tipped off friends about their decisions, particularly during the market\u2019s fall last summer. New rules also make it hard for the spouses and children of regulators to live overseas, even though the regulatory agency has also been widely accused of lacking workers with international experience and connections.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the biggest challenge for Mr. Xiao\u2019s successor may be a lack of autonomy. The senior leadership in Beijing gave little latitude to Mr. Xiao, and it is likely to vet and second-guess his successor as well.\u201cEven changing him is not going to change the system,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of one of China\u2019s largest banks. \u201cI don\u2019t see how someone else will want to take his job; he has a very unenviable position.\u201dMr. Xiao, who earned an undergraduate degree from Hunan University and a master\u2019s degree in law from Renmin University, spent much of his career in finance.He started at the People\u2019s Bank of China in 1981. At the central bank, he held several posts, including director general of the fund planning department and the monetary policy department, working his way up to deputy governor.Mr. Xiao took over at the securities regulator in March 2013, putting him at the helm during the rise and the fall of the Chinese stock markets.When the markets started tumbling, Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency rolled out a raft of measures to help stabilize the situation. He halted initial public offerings of stock and banned share sales by large stakeholders.The regulator\u2019s efforts worked for a while, but they started to backfire in January.Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency introduced so-called circuit breakers for its stock market on the first trading day of this year. The circuit breakers mandated that markets would close for 15 minutes if share prices fell 5 percent and would close for the day if they fell 7 percent.It was intended to provide a cooling-off period. But in practice, it added to the anxiety in the markets.As markets began sustained slides, investors rushed to sell as many shares as possible before the circuit breakers could shut down trading. The thresholds were hit in quick succession, twice during the first week of trading in January.Further policy measures only added to investors\u2019 confusion. The ban of share sales was supposed to expire, and the country\u2019s central bank was pushing down the value of the currency.As China\u2019s stock markets and the value of the renminbi tumbled faster, the country\u2019s leaders ended up scrapping all three policies in less than 24 hours. The circuit breakers were repealed, the ban on sales of shares by large stakeholders was extended, and the central bank intervened decisively in currency markets to halt any further drop in the renminbi.\u201cIt was a correct strategy to take market-stabilizing measures against unusual movements in stocks and the currency last year,\u201d Prime Minister Li said last Monday of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, according to the government-controlled Beijing News. \u201cLooking back, the major responsible departments took inadequate actions and had internal management issues.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dividends, Wall Street\u2019s Battered Status Symbol", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cInvestors look at that record, and they count on it,\u201d said Douglas J. Skinner, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cAfter a while, the dividend becomes sacrosanct.\u201dCompanies hate to cut dividends because they know that such an announcement would hurt their reputation with investors. Yet in a difficult financial environment, startlingly large numbers of corporations are slashing dividends anyway. That trend is disturbing.Look at the statistics: In 2015, 394 companies trimmed dividends, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was a whopping 38 percent increase over the previous year, and it was 23 percent more than in 2008, an awful time for the stock market and for the economy.They were happy exceptions. A host of other major companies \u2014 like Alcoa, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Macy\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 decided, under considerable pressure, that it was time to capitulate. They all cut their dividends.You may recall 2009 with a shudder. The market hit bottom that March, before beginning a long climb upward. That upward trajectory has now been interrupted. And the ebb and flow of dividends is an important part of the story.The situation today isn\u2019t nearly as dire for most companies as it was in 2009, and the stock market and the economy generally appear to be much stronger. Nor are all companies cutting dividends. In fact, over all, corporate dividends rose last year and, barring a severe economic shock, they are likely to do so in 2016. So are stock buybacks, the other widely used method of returning cash to investors. But as a market indicator, a wave of dividend cuts is an indication that many companies are troubled.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re in another 2009, or that the bottom is falling out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. But it\u2019s hard to put a positive spin on it: So many companies cutting dividends is not a good thing.\u201dPockets of pain have become more apparent, especially in the energy and commodities sectors. Battered by falling oil prices, for example, ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum announced this month that they were cutting most of their dividends. And on Thursday, Rio Tinto, the Anglo-American mining giant, said that the prospects for commodity prices remained dim \u2014 and it, too, slashed its dividend.But he warned that others wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same: \u201cIn the volatile years, especially if you look at some of the high-paying dividend stocks today, I think you\u2019re going to see quite a few companies are going to have to lower their dividends.\u201dQuite a few are likely to cut their share buybacks, too. Depending on the size of their cash hoards, companies tend to turn buybacks on and off much more rapidly than they do dividends. For example, the value of buybacks exceeded that of dividends in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index before the financial crisis, but by the second quarter of 2009, that reversed. With the return of corporate prosperity, buybacks surged and by 2015, the value of buybacks was roughly 50 percent greater than that of dividends.That is a puzzle for academics. As a fundamental economic proposition the two modes of payouts amount to the same thing, Professor Skinner said.While there may be different practical consequences, both return economic value to shareholders. Yet the reality is that investors tend to drive up the shares of companies that raise dividends and punish companies that reduce them, while reacting much less to shifts in buybacks.The explanation may come from signaling behavior. When a company can keep its dividends steady, it may be signaling that it is managed more deftly and more conservatively than its peers. At least that\u2019s often the way it\u2019s seen in the markets.By the same token, investors may see buybacks as inherently transitory, so they don\u2019t get as riled when they lose them. In any case, as a practical matter, buybacks are often a more flexible tool for corporate financial officers. Consider ExxonMobil\u2019s moves early this month. They were drawn from the classic corporate finance playbook. It said that dividends were a \u201cpriority,\u201d and unlike Conoco, it said that it would maintain them and preserve its ability to make important capital investments during the oil price downturn.Once the biggest practitioner of buybacks in the stock market, Exxon has been paring them for the last two years, and announced that it would reduce them more radically to conserve cash. Exxon\u2019s shares have actually risen slightly this month while Conoco\u2019s have fallen sharply.For investors, these corporate maneuvers are just another indication that the stock market is operating under duress. In the long run, it is the financial and earnings strength of companies that matters, not whether they are paying dividends or buying back shares. The problem, of course, is determining whether a specific company is merely being prudent by paring payouts, or whether it is revealing that its business is seriously troubled.If you have long-term investments in broad index funds, and not in individual stocks, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about particular companies, and even if dividend cuts portend market declines, you can prosper if you can endure some pain.Even with recent declines, the S.&P. 500 index has returned more than 200 percent \u2014 17.5 percent annualized \u2014 since the market bottom of March 2009. Indexes of stocks with high and stable dividends did even better. That may be because steady dividend payers are more solid. It may simply be that investors prefer dividends. We don\u2019t really know.But people who have truly relied on dividends for income may have to face a sad truth. Dividends aren\u2019t bonds, and they may be cut at a company\u2019s discretion. So love dividends if you must. Just don\u2019t count on them.Advertisement"}

Balmy fall temperatures, which continued off and on into December, helped jump-start the rental season, brokers said, as more New Yorkers found themselves driving out to eastern Long Island for a weekend getaway well into late fall.\u201cI think people were already out here for other reasons because the weather was so good,\u201d said Erin Keneally, an agent in the Bridgehampton office of the Corcoran Group. \u201cSo they killed two birds\u201d with one stone, she said, \u201cby looking for a summer rental and hanging out with friends.\u201dMs. Keneally said it was much easier to show homes when there is little snow or freezing temperatures, especially if their pools have not been covered yet or the outdoor furniture taken in. So far, she has doubled the number of early bookings compared with previous years, she said, without providing specific numbers. The weather was not the only factor. Anxiety over terrorist attacks in Europe made some repeat renters, especially those who work on Wall Street and keep close tabs on global news events during the trading day, nervous about spending time overseas. These travel concerns also may have helped fuel the early start, Mr. Saunders said. Many high-end homes with leases of $200,000 to $400,000 for a full season have been snatched up earlier than usual, he added. Inventory, though, remains good, with hundreds of homes available in that price category. Jonathan Davis, an agent at Compass, said he found it rather odd when a client called him in November asking for a full-season rental, which covers Memorial Day through Labor Day. The client, a hedge fund manager who is married with three children, had always rented a home in East Hampton for the month of July, and usually took off for France in August.\u201cWhen I asked my client why he was changing his usual plan, he said he was nervous about taking his family to France,\u201d especially after the November terrorist attacks in Paris, Mr. Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him; I feel nervous about going to Europe, too,\u201d he added. The client leased a five-bedroom East Hampton home for $250,000 for the full season. Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist for the Manhattan brokerage firm Convergex, said most Wall Street professionals don\u2019t take much vacation, so when they do, they try to make it count.\u201cWith parts of Europe battling all kinds of things \u2014 a weak economy, a migrant crisis and terrorist attacks \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of concern on Wall Street about security and the political climate,\u201d said Mr. Colas, who is the author of a Hamptons summer rental report that takes a look at the fortunes of those who work on Wall Street and how they affect the high-end rental market on the East End of Long Island. \u201cFrom what I sense at work and in the Hamptons, security concerns are trumping foreign exchange rates,\u201d added Mr. Colas, who has had a home in Southampton for about 20 years. He noted that when the dollar is stronger than the euro, or close to its value, as it is now, it is less expensive \u2014 and normally more attractive \u2014 for American vacationers to head to Europe. \u201cI think the fear of travel is more than anecdotal,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cPeople are concerned about getting on a plane and going to France. Not since post-9/11 have I heard so much concern about safety.\u201d The Hamptons market largely mirrors regional trends, but price increases there are also linked to the performance of Wall Street. And in the last five years, money made from deferred Wall Street bonuses that flowed into the Hamptons market was a huge factor, Mr. Colas said. After the recession, many financial institutions asked their employees to take company stock instead of cash bonuses, which they couldn\u2019t sell for a few years, dampening the Hamptons real estate market until 2011. Setting aside recent stock market volatility, this action turned out to be a windfall for those employees, because shares of bank stocks have been strong since the end of the recession, Mr. Colas said. As of Feb. 3 the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had risen about 13 percent over the last five years. \u201cWhen Hamptons real estate, which has such a limited supply when compared to Manhattan, saw all the liquidity from money made from deferred bonuses, prices went higher,\u201d Mr. Colas said.Beate V. Moore, an associate broker in the Bridgehampton office of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said rental inquiries so far have been about the same as in previous years. But she was happy to be able to rent out a seven-bedroom home in Sagaponack last fall for $400,000 for Aug. 1 through Sept. 15. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual rental because the home is off the water and doesn\u2019t have a tennis court,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of my high-end clients always want to upgrade from what they had the previous summer, so they start early.\u201dMarcy Bloom, a publishing executive who lives in Manhattan, is feeling the pressure to find a suitable summer rental. After looking to buy a summer home in the Hamptons for the better part of last year and not finding one to her liking, in December Ms. Bloom called the owner of her previous rental in Water Mill, N.Y., to see if she could lease it for the summer. To her dismay, the five-bedroom home had already been rented to someone else. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cI was absolutely in love with that house.\u201dNow, she added, \u201cI keep swinging back and forth between searching for sales and rentals, but I know I need to move quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising Yen Adds to Abe\u2019s Challenges as Japan\u2019s Economy Contracts", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan began a campaign three years ago to turn around his country\u2019s economy, he took aim at areas as varied as taxes, trade and women in the workplace. The campaign, given the nickname Abenomics, relied heavily on one strategy: weakening the country\u2019s currency.Initially, it worked, as Japan\u2019s stock market soared and corporate profits rose. But now that weapon is misfiring, and Abenomics may be in trouble.Turmoil in global markets is making the yen rise in value again. That has resulted in big hits to the Japanese stock market and has raised worries among economists that Mr. Abe will not be able to deliver the economic growth his country needs to get back on track.\u201cAbenomics is in danger of falling apart,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.The challenge mounted on Monday, after officials said the Japanese economy \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest, after those of the United States and China \u2014 shrank more than expected in the last three months of 2015. The economy has now contracted in five of the past 12 quarters, and for all of 2015 it grew an anemic 0.4 percent. Japan will hold elections this summer, putting more pressure on Mr. Abe and his governing coalition to turn around the economy.Japanese officials say they do not manage the currency. But until recently, it was working in Mr. Abe\u2019s favor.In the eyes of many Japanese policy makers and business leaders, a weaker yen is a better yen. It makes big employers like Toyota and Panasonic more profitable by inflating the value of their overseas earnings. A weaker currency also drives up the cost of imported goods, but even that can be beneficial: It helps Japan shake off a vicious cycle of falling prices that has led to lower profits and less spending.Currency depreciation goes a long way to explaining how Toyota\u2019s profit in North America rose five times faster than its sales volume from 2012 to last year. Toyota is now on course to become the first Japanese company to earn 3 trillion yen ($26.4 billion) in operating profit this financial year.The currency windfall is a byproduct of Abenomics.The central bank, under Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor Mr. Abe appointed in 2013, has been flooding financial markets with yen by buying vast quantities of government bonds. The explicit goal of the strategy is to make it as easy as possible for people to borrow and spend.An unspoken goal, many economists says, is to weaken the yen. Three years after Mr. Abe took office, the yen had fallen against the dollar by about 40 percent.But growing worries about the global economic outlook have undone some of that weakening. Since December, the yen\u2019s value has risen about 10 percent against the dollar. Investors have flooded into the currency, which they see as a haven for their money.The shift could hurt Japanese companies that have been counting on the yen\u2019s weakness, Mr. Adachi of JPMorgan Chase said. So far, companies have been saving most of their windfalls.Toyota has more than \u00a515 trillion in so-called accumulated retained earnings, essentially the profit that a company keeps rather than distributing it to shareholders. Honda has nearly \u00a57 trillion, while Canon\u2019s exceeds \u00a53 trillion.But those savings will shrink with a more expensive yen. If it grows too strong, they are likely to start cutting costs \u2014 crimping wages and investment, which experts see as vital to helping the economy rebound.The problems are playing out in the stock market, which has been volatile of late.Last week, the Nikkei 225 stock average plunged 12 percent, as the yen strengthened to its highest level in more than a year. It was the worst performance of Japanese stocks since the depths of the global financial crisis seven years ago.Then on Monday, stocks roared back. The Nikkei gained more than 7 percent, after a reprieve in foreign equity and energy markets on Friday took some of the upward pressure off the yen.The stock surge came despite news that gross domestic product had declined at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the final quarter of last year, dragged down by anemic consumer spending and exports. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected, on average, a contraction of 0.8 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that they will push the policy rate even further into negative territory or take some other easing steps,\u201d he said.As he looks to revive the economy, Mr. Abe also faces political pressure.Japan\u2019s governing coalition must contend with an election for the upper house of Parliament this summer. Analysts and advisers say Mr. Abe has been counting on public support for his economic policies to extend the coalition\u2019s majority there. The strategy now looks less certain, though it is unclear whether Japan\u2019s weak opposition parties can capitalize on voter disappointment.Their attacks have focused mostly on Mr. Abe\u2019s hawkish security policies. On the economy, they have offered little in the way of alternatives.Government spending was one of two areas that made a positive contribution to growth last quarter, according to the economic report on Monday. The other was business investment, which increased by an unexpectedly strong 1.4 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 though that is an area that is often subject to significant recalculations in revised G.D.P. reports.Naohiko Baba, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, said that the government, which is heavily indebted, could be tempted to raise spending as well as to endorse more printing of the yen by the central bank. Mr. Abe, he said, was \u201cincreasingly likely to face pressure to prepare additional fiscal stimulus ahead of the July upper house elections.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Feb. 16 about the state of the economy in Japan misstated what trends in the value of the yen might encourage Japanese companies to cut costs, wages and investments. That could be a result of a stronger yen, not a weaker one.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Tries to Calm Investors on Its Outlook and Oil Defenses", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byJPMorgan Chase executives painted a positive picture of the American economy and the bank\u2019s business at their annual investor day, but they failed to beat back the pessimism that has battered bank shares and the broader stock market in recent months.The bank, America\u2019s largest, saw its share price fall throughout its investor day on Tuesday after disclosing during the morning that it is putting aside an additional $500 million to cover potential losses from falling oil prices. The stock ended the session down 4.2 percent, falling more than the broad indexes.Since late November, JPMorgan\u2019s stock price has dropped 17 percent. Many banks are trading even lower, reaching levels near those hit in 2011.JPMorgan\u2019s stock has performed better than that of most of the other large banks and JPMorgan executives insisted on Tuesday that they were optimistic about nearly all of their business lines and planned to report record profits once again this year.\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of noise out there,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, told the investors gathered at JPMorgan\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. \u201cThere are pretty good odds the noise will sort out and we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d\u201cI look at it as just a very good long-term buy,\u201d he said on Tuesday.On Tuesday, the bank\u2019s executives were fighting against new economic data from the Conference Board showing that consumer confidence fell in February to a seven-month low.Mr. Dimon and other executives said that when they look at the bank\u2019s data, they are not seeing any sign that consumers are cutting back. Fewer consumers are having trouble paying loans, and new loans are growing.But much of the recent damage to the stock market has come from concerns over the global economy and the declining price of oil, and those were the subjects many of the analysts and investors were asking about on Tuesday.Douglas Petno, head of the JPMorgan division most involved in the energy industry \u2014 the commercial bank \u2014 said the real impact of the lower price of oil has not yet been felt on what was a booming American energy sector.\u201cI think we\u2019ve only begun to see the range of bankruptcies in oil and gas,\u201d Mr. Petno said.He and other executives said JPMorgan and most other banks had limited their overall exposure to these sorts of losses.Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer, said that by the end of this quarter, JPMorgan would have put aside $1.3 billion to cover for possible losses in the energy sector, up 60 percent from the end of 2015. The bank has $44 billion in loans to the oil and gas sector.As in recent years, the bank\u2019s profits have come, in part, from lowering its head count and expenses. On Tuesday, JPMorgan executives emphasized the investments in technology the bank is making and that should allow it to continue to reduce its staffing levels and expenses.Unlike other banks, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s Wall Street operations, Daniel Pinto, said that the bank was not cutting significantly from its bond and currency trading operations, which have been hit by new regulations.\u201cAt some point, this business will go back to growth \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be contracting forever,\u201d Mr. Pinto said.An article on Wednesday about JPMorgan Chase\u2019s efforts to reassure investors as its shares drop misstated the bank\u2019s profit expectations. It envisions profits of $30 billion a year within the next few years, not this year, and that figure is an assumption based on the trajectory of earnings, not a prediction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Officials, at Meeting, Found Economic Outlook Cloudy", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials threw up their hands in January, deciding that they could not decide whether market turmoil would impede domestic economic growth.\u201cMost policy makers thought that the extent to which tighter conditions would persist and what that might imply for the outlook were unclear, and they therefore judged it was premature to alter appreciably their assessment of the medium-term economic outlook,\u201d the meeting account said.It was the first time since March 2003 that the Fed declined to characterize the risks to its outlook, according to Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.The Fed is unlikely to raise its benchmark interest rate while this confusion persists, suggesting that investors are right to discount chances of a rate increase at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in March. But according to the account, Fed officials remain optimistic that the market turmoil will not leave a lasting mark, indicating that rate increases could resume this year.\u201cLack of agreement on the balance of risks puts the committee into a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 posture,\u201d said Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist at HSBC. \u201cIn our view, it is nearly certain that the committee will not be raising the federal funds rate at the March or April meetings. It is not likely that enough time will pass before those meetings take place for the uncertainty surrounding the international economic and financial market situation to clear up.\u201dFed officials probably wish they hadn\u2019t scheduled a meeting for late January, given the convulsions in financial markets caused in part by falling oil prices and broader concerns about the health of the global economy. Officials worried that investors were tightening financial conditions, raising interest rates for riskier borrowers while plowing money into safe havens like Treasuries.And the persistent sluggishness of inflation provided one more source of uncertainty. The Fed maintains an official expectation that inflation will rise as job growth continues. Yet the continued decline of oil prices and the dollar\u2019s strength are delaying any such rebound, and some Fed officials noted worrying signs that people\u2019s expectations for future inflation also were eroding.Some officials thought the costs and benefits of the forces roiling the global economy, taken together, would have a surprisingly small effect on the domestic economy. Lower stock prices are draining wealth from households, but falling oil prices put money right back into the same pockets. Moreover, those officials continue to expect faster growth later this year.Others, however, thought tighter financial conditions already had increased risks to the economic outlook. Several Fed officials, according to the minutes, argued that \u201cwaiting for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy accommodation would be prudent.\u201dEric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the 10 voting members of the policy-making committee this year, said on Tuesday that recent economic developments meant the Fed should wait before raising rates again.According to the account, few officials felt confidence in their assessments. It was easy enough to leave rates unchanged, but they still had to say something. So the Fed professed honest bewilderment. \u201cMost participants indicated that it was difficult to judge at this point whether the outlook for inflation and economic growth had changed materially,\u201d the account said.Mr. Feroli of JPMorgan Chase described the minutes as downbeat, emphasizing economic risks like the impact of tighter financial conditions. \u201cThe effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy,\u201d the account said.Yet in keeping with the Fed\u2019s uncertain mood, the account also echoed recent comments by the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, suggesting that investors had overreacted and could reverse themselves. \u201cThe large magnitude of changes in domestic financial market conditions was difficult to reconcile with incoming information on U.S. economic developments,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legal Marijuana Sales Hit $5.4 Billion in 2015, Report Says", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s not just heat lamps in closets and nickel bags anymore: Marijuana is getting some respect as legal sales take off.\u201cThere is still a certain stigma around it,\u201d said Brandy Keen, a co-founder of Surna, which makes technology for indoor cultivation. \u201cThis is an industry that came out of the basement. It grew out of closets and basements and hidden facilities in cinder-block buildings.\u201dNonmedicinal adult use accounted for $998 million of the total sales in 2015, up from $351 million in 2014, according to the ArcView/New Frontier report summary. The estimates are based partly on state tax receipts and data on medical and recreational sales.The report summary said that by 2020, legal market sales were forecast to be $21.8 billion.The latest report defined three types of legal marijuana use: adult recreational use; medical use of cannabis; and medicinal use of a cannabis product from which the compound that gets a consumer high has been extracted.It said 2016 would be the \u201ctipping point\u201d at which a majority of states transition from cannabis prohibition to some form of regulated legal market.John Kagia, New Frontier\u2019s director of industry analytics, said he has spoken at investment meetings about legal marijuana where it was \u201cstanding room only\u201d with investors trying to \u201cfigure out angles\u201d given the regulatory climate.Four states and the District of Columbia allow full adult use, and this year, seven more will vote on allowing it: California, Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.Twenty-three states already permit medical cannabis use, and four others \u2014 Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania \u2014 are positioned to advance medical laws, the report said.Some federal regulatory barriers are easing, and federal interest in research into medical marijuana use is growing. But there are headwinds, the report cautioned.Cannabis businesses face a higher tax burden. They are also unable to use banks because of federal laws, which can hinder efficiency and pose security risks, forcing the businesses to invest heavily in security measures. Increased competition across state lines could pose new challenges as more states legalize the trade.Marijuana stocks underperformed on the market in 2015 compared with the Nasdaq and Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes, tempering some of the enthusiasm of investors, the report said.Legalization is also a hot topic of national debate, making the industry vulnerable in an election year.\u201cThough public opinion is shifting toward embracing cannabis reform, presidential candidates are more reticent to support legalization,\u201d the report said.The plant\u2019s business potential has deep and roots, as the rapper Snoop Dogg, the country singer Willie Nelson and the actor Tommy Chong have demonstrated by leveraging their celebrity status to establish new brands in the market, the report noted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Heresy on Wall Street: Look Past the Quarter", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDealBookMost money managers clamor for companies to provide detailed guidance on their next quarter, down to the penny \u2014 but not the world\u2019s largest investor.Laurence D. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, which with more than $4.6 trillion in assets under management makes it the world\u2019s largest investor, sent a letter to 500 chief executives late Monday urging them for the first time to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates.\u201cToday\u2019s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria is totally contrary to the long-term approach we need,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote.The proposal, a provocative recommendation from the influential Wall Street executive, is aimed at trying to curb companies\u2019 short-term focus on quarterly results.\u201cTo be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results \u2014 long-termism should not be a substitute for transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cBut C.E.O.s should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their E.P.S. targets or analyst consensus estimates.\u201d (E.P.S. stands for earnings per share.) Mr. Fink has made a series of proposals over the last several years to encourage longer-term thinking by companies, including a plan to change the tax code and the treatment of capital gains. But his latest proposition goes further than his previous efforts. Mr. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, sent a letter to 500 chief executives urging them to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates, as a way to curb the focus on short-term results.While Mr. Fink wants to eliminate quarterly guidance, he is also making perhaps an even more controversial request, asking chief executives and company boards to provide a \u201ca strategic framework for long-term value creation\u201d that could extend to multiple years. In other words, a company should give shareholders a detailed long-term plan for its business.\u201cAnnual shareholder letters and other communications to shareholders are too often backwards-looking and don\u2019t do enough to articulate management\u2019s vision and plans for the future,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. Without management providing a road map for the next few years, he said, \u201csome short-term investors (and analysts) offer more compelling visions for companies than the companies themselves, allowing these perspectives to fill the void and build support for potentially destabilizing actions.\u201dActivist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to return money to shareholders or buy back shares. Last year through the end of the third quarter, according to Mr. Fink, buybacks skyrocketed 27 percent over the previous year, which itself had been a record. Companies that buy back shares reduce the amount of stock they have outstanding, a move that can have the effect of increasing earnings per share and the stakes of existing shareholders. Mr. Fink\u2019s call comes at a time of stepped-up chatter among big investors and other business leaders to try to encourage companies and investors to be less focused on short-term efforts to lift earnings. Critics of buybacks question whether the purchases are a productive use of profits, rather than investing in their businesses and creating jobs. BlackRock, along with other mutual fund giants like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, recently held a meeting with Warren E. Buffett at the invitation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to devise a series of voluntary standards that companies should adopt, according to people briefed on the meetings. Another meeting is planned for next month. The discussion of short-termism on Wall Street has also become part of the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton made a policy speech last year that endorsed many of the ideas Mr. Fink had raised. There has long been speculation that Mr. Fink could eventually land a senior government post in Washington.In an interview, Mr. Fink said he wrote this letter now to get ahead of proxy season, a period during the spring when many companies hold their annual meetings and vote on shareholder resolutions. He hopes to influence how chief executives discuss their companies\u2019 performance and goals in their annual letters to shareholders.Of course, some companies in fast-moving businesses like technology might argue that it is impossible to present a multiyear road map without telegraphing plans to rivals.Mr. Fink dismissed that possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think a public discourse on how a company\u2019s C.E.O. sees their position is going to result in proprietary secrets being revealed.\u201dInvestors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.He doesn\u2019t want to put all of the responsibility on the chief executive. His letter presses company boards to publicly affirm the chief executive\u2019s long-term plan. All too often, there is a disconnect between the vision of a chief executive and the board, especially when things go wrong.Of course, the other challenge with a company offering a long-term vision is not only meeting its goals, but also changing them if the market or economy change. Mr. Fink said he appreciated that argument, but contended that boards that lay out multiyear plans won\u2019t feel locked into them.\u201cGiven the right context, long-term shareholders will understand, and even expect, that you will need to pivot in response to the changing environments you are navigating,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. \u201cBut one reason for investors\u2019 short-term horizons is that companies have not sufficiently educated them about the ecosystems they are operating in.\u201dThat may be true, but it is admittedly difficult for executives to reverse course without worrying about losing face.Mr. Fink is also pushing for companies to consider environmental, social and governance issues \u201cranging from climate change to diversity to board effectiveness.\u201d These issues have long been an afterthought for most companies, and in particular, for investors, who have simply sought companies that deliver the highest returns.\u201cThese issues offer both risks and opportunities, but for too long, companies have not considered them core to their business \u2014 even when the world\u2019s political leaders are increasingly focused on them, as demonstrated by the Paris climate accord,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. Finally, Mr. Fink suggests that business actually needs to take on a greater responsibility in pushing for change in Washington. He says that tax policy needs to be reformed and investment in infrastructure must become a priority. If the government fails to invest in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, it \u201cwill not only cost businesses and consumers $1.8 trillion over the next five years, but clearly represents a threat to the ability of companies to grow.\u201dHe says he believes that corporate America needs help from Washington to shift to a more long-term focus. \u201cWe recognize that the culture of short-term results is not something that can be solved by C.E.O.s and their boards alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Investors fear a global downturn.The Fed says it is still thinking about raising its benchmark interest rate again as soon as March.

The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down nearly 255 points, or 1.6 percent.\u201cA lot has happened\u201d since December, when the Fed predicted it would spend 2016 gradually raising rates, Ms. Yellen acknowledged.

Asked about the risk of a recession, Ms. Yellen responded that anything is possible but \u201cexpansions don\u2019t die of old age.\u201d She made clear that Fed officials were still debating when, not whether, they should raise rates again.\u201cWe will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had,\u201d Ms. Yellen told Congress and the cameras, referring to the market turmoil and next month\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cToday I think it\u2019s premature to render a judgment.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s mainly our policy,\u201d she told Mr. Heller.But some analysts say the Fed is playing a role. They worry that the Fed, and its counterparts around the world, either cannot or will not move to shore up growth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has lost 10 percent of its value this year, closing Thursday at 1,829.08. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury climbed to the highest level since 2012.\u201cIt seems central banks have reached the end of road,\u201d said Markus Schomer, the chief economist at PineBridge Investments in New York. \u201cNo support for scared financial markets here.\u201dThe price of Fed funds futures, bets on the future level of the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, now reflect roughly a 10 percent chance the Fed will raise rates this year. That means investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to make things worse. But they see little prospect that the Fed will expand its efforts.Indeed, Ms. Yellen said on Thursday that the Fed did not intend to cut rates back to zero.She also continued to play down the possibility that the Fed would seek to provide new stimulus by imposing negative interest rates \u2014 basically reversing the normal order of things so that lenders pay a fee for lending while borrowers collect a fee for borrowing.Ms. Yellen surprised some members of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday when she testified that the Fed had not considered the idea in detail. On Thursday she was slightly less dismissive, telling senators the Fed was reviewing the issue, but emphasizing again that she did not foresee a need for negative rates here.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take those off the table, but we would have work to do to judge whether they would be workable here,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also played down some reasons for pessimism. She has previously pointed to stronger wage growth as an important sign that the economy is improving, and on Thursday she said that she was not overly impressed by signs of acceleration in the recent data. \u201cAt best the evidence of a pickup is tentative,\u201d she said.But in an exchange with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Ms. Yellen also appeared to back away from her previous emphasis on that indicator.\u201cI would not say that wage growth is a litmus test for changes in monetary policy,\u201d she said.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, emphasized that a crucial reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years was the relatively slow growth of productivity, or the economic output of the average worker.\u201cDoes monetary policy affect workers\u2019 knowledge or skills?\u201d he asked Ms. Yellen.As she began to answer, he interjected, \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous notion, is it not?\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201dHe meant that Congress could improve productivity by effective investment in areas like education or by changing the tax code to encourage innovation.Ms. Yellen said she generally agreed, but she noted that the Fed did have a role to play by encouraging economic growth. Companies curtail investments during downturns, and workers without jobs begin to lose their skills.Asked by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, what more the Fed could do to reduce long-term unemployment, she emphasized the point.\u201cWhat we are trying to do to contribute to the solution of that problem is to keep the economy growing at a steady pace, to keep the labor market improving, in the hope and expectation that a stronger labor market will improve the status of all groups,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Yellen disappointed Democrats too by suggesting that in her view the Fed was doing enough. She reiterated the Fed\u2019s position that it was necessary to raise interest rates to maintain control of inflation as job growth continued.\u201cI see it just the other way,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cI am less worried about inflation and more worried about slow wage growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Most Dedicated All-Natural Perfumer", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn BeautyTHE NATURAL INGREDIENTS that Aftel sources and studies are among the world\u2019s oldest luxuries, scents that have been prized for millennia. They come with exotic provenances and marvelous histories. That she would find them seductive is no surprise. What\u2019s rarer than Aftel\u2019s ardor for the ingredients is her steadfast loyalty to them and her refusal to supplement essences of the natural world with the man-made synthetics that have dominated the perfume industry for over a century.Brought to the market in the late 1800s, synthesized products are present in every perfume you\u2019ve ever heard of. Unlike a natural essence, which is made up of dozens of molecules (lemon oil contains approximately 20 different molecules; rose oil has more than 100), a synthetic aromachemical is often just a single molecule, which, according to Aftel, makes its scent less complex. Fragrance chemistry began in 1868 with artificially produced coumarin, the main component of tonka beans, which have a nutty, tobacco-like smell. The following year, scientists artificially produced heliotropin, which smells a bit like baby powder and is found in vanilla. Later, chemists figured out how to mimic the scent of \u2018\u2018mute flowers\u2019\u2019 such as lily of the valley and lilac, whose fragrance cannot be extracted because they don\u2019t produce enough oil. \u2018\u2018Without synthetics,\u2019\u2019 says By Kilian founder Kilian Hennessy, \u2018\u2018you don\u2019t have Shalimar, you don\u2019t have L\u2019Air du Temps, you don\u2019t have Chanel No. 5.\u2019\u2019To demonstrate the differences between synthetics and naturals, Aftel put before me three tiny bottles of jasmine: synthetic, natural and natural aged. I inhaled them in that order, sniffing a swatch of wool between each to offset nasal fatigue, and it was like seeing a graphite sketch transform into a value study that in turn became a fully finished portrait. Had I been given only the synthetic, I would have found it divine \u2014 syrupy, sweet, like something I\u2019d like to lap up \u2014 but the natural jasmine and even more so the aged natural jasmine made the synthetic seem, in retrospect, simplistic, shallow, somehow relegated only to the front of my nose as opposed to the deep recesses of my throat and tongue. After a series of unbecoming groans and unconscious gestures of revelation, I said as much to Aftel. She nodded, her eyebrows raised into twin arches of I-told-you-so amusement.Like a chef who only uses ingredients grown within 100 miles of her kitchen, a large part of Aftel\u2019s pride and satisfaction is derived from the sacrifice that comes out of self-imposed constraints. That those constraints result in a limited but more exuberant lexicon is more than just a pleasant side effect; it\u2019s arguably what Aftel\u2019s business is all about \u2014 exposing the uninitiated to the world\u2019s most precious products and talking about them.But the complexity afforded by natural essences \u2014 which often transform across the duration of even a single inhale, differ from supplier to supplier and change, like wine, from year to year \u2014 comes with a cost. Their sillage (the industry term for a scent\u2019s trail) is weak; perfume made without synthetics tends to fade quickly on the skin, becoming perceptible only to the nose-to-the-wrist wearer. And by refusing to work with synthetics, perfumers limit their options for ingredients tremendously. \u2018\u2018By four-fifths,\u2019\u2019 estimates Francis Kurkdjian, a French perfumer famous for creations including Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier, My Burberry and Narciso for Her. Like many others, Kurkdjian sees abstaining from synthetics as an arbitrary kind of atavism. \u2018\u2018Synthetics bring new colors to the palette, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to go back,\u2019\u2019 he says.Aftel disagrees. Though synthetics can be made into scents that don\u2019t already exist in the world, she prefers the ephemeral qualities of natural fragrance, the intimacy of a scent that only the wearer and those in extremely close proximity can smell. \u2018\u2018The things that make a perfume last all day are also what make it radiate in that obnoxious way for everyone else,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I think that\u2019s actually kind of unsensual.\u2019\u2019EACH CHRISTMAS, Aftel opens her house up for three days and invites people \u2014 many who come from out of state \u2014 to do their holiday shopping. Otherwise, Aftelier is online-only. She currently stocks 18 scents, which sell for $180 to $400 per quarter ounce \u2014 up to three times the price of department-store perfume. Leonard Cohen is a fan, as is Lucinda Williams.Aftel compares perfumery to working with fine jewels, in the sense that she is making a luxury product from valuable and esoterically sourced materials. \u2018\u2018You have to love this stuff. Nobody needs perfume. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the cure for cancer.\u2019\u2019 She sees herself as a champion of an underloved dimension of the world, a human conduit leading her clients to an aesthetic awareness they didn\u2019t even know they were missing. Eighteenth- and 19th-century European philosophers who argued that sight was the perception most integral to reason are in large part to blame for the West\u2019s demotion of smell to the lowest rung in the hierarchy of the senses. In other times and places, it\u2019s been central to culture: Musk was added to the mortar of Byzantine mosques to make the walls themselves aromatic; the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal organized their calendar year according to the fragrances emitted by flowers.\u2018\u2018Your sense of smell is connected to so much of what makes life pleasurable: eating, gardening, drinking,\u2019\u2019 Aftel said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a shame that the world of larger commercial perfume is the biggest experience people have with these very, very beautiful smells.\u2019\u2019Though giant fragrance conglomerates including LVMH and its company Sephora have approached Aftel, she\u2019s always turned them down. Aftel buys essences in small quantities, often from suppliers who don\u2019t have enough of any one thing to permit more than a few hundred bottles\u2019 worth of fragrance, and she throws out batches that aren\u2019t precisely what she wants.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m in a position to use the absolute best ingredients,\u2019\u2019 she told me. And the best isn\u2019t cheap. High-quality oud is $44,000 per kilo; boronia is $14,000 per kilo. She has one fragrance in which four ingredients each cost in excess of $10,000 per kilo. Mainstream perfume purveyors typically allot much less (about $60 to $120 per kilo) for the \u2018\u2018juice\u2019\u2019 and spend more on advertising and packaging and distribution. Meanwhile, Aftel has almost no overhead. She has the freedom to spend her days sourcing new scents and finding more vivid versions of ones she already owns, and teaching small workshops in perfume-making out of her house. She writes books, and is in the early stages of converting her garage into a scent museum.Aftel has an unusual biography for a perfumer. Born in Detroit to upper-middle-class Jewish professionals, she associates her childhood with the artificial aromas of suburbia: asphalt, detergent, chlorinated swimming pools. She attended the University of Michigan, married her first husband, moved to Berkeley, took up weaving and, as she put it, \u2018\u2018kind of fell into writing a book about Brian Jones.\u2019\u2019 She kind of fell into perfume, too. She\u2019d been working as a therapist to artists and writers for 30 years when she began writing a novel and decided to make the protagonist a perfumer. \u2018\u2018I have no idea why,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I thought it sounded sexy and interesting; I didn\u2019t really think about it.\u2019\u2019 In researching the book, she became entranced by scents, took a class in making solid perfume, and within a few short years quit her therapy practice and started a natural-fragrance line with a friend that was subsequently sold at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The company dissolved, but Aftel continued concocting scents, and also began writing about them.A formally trained \u2018\u2018nose,\u2019\u2019 which Aftel is not, typically apprentices with established perfumers and undergoes courses in organic chemistry; traditionally, many noses spent time in Grasse, France, but the industry no longer has a precise epicenter \u2014 there are creative offices in New York and Paris, as well as labs in New Jersey. Aftel, however, is a self-taught nose whose entire schooling has taken place in her home.A FEW HOURS into our conversation, Aftel led me to her organ, the industry term for a perfumer\u2019s workstation. Aftel\u2019s is made from Douglas fir, custom-built and lined with hundreds of vials. She thinks of the oils, she said, \u2018\u2018as friends.\u2019\u2019 Top notes, which are the light-colored distilled essential oils that reach your nose first, take up five shelves on the left. By and large, they\u2019re the least expensive of her ingredients: citruses, herbs, light woods. The middle notes, which are stored in the center of the organ, last about two to four hours on the skin. They\u2019re darker in color and consist of the spices and heavier florals. The right wing of the organ is devoted to the thick, sometimes even resinous base notes. These are the precious, famous things \u2014 patchouli, sandalwood, oud, myrrh.Aftel sat me down and instructed me to take off my glasses. It was time to make me a perfume.\u2018\u2018You need to respond to the materials in a way that\u2019s 100 percent yes,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Do not be polite.\u2019\u2019 I nodded.We began with citruses, the only essences stored not on the organ\u2019s shelves, but in a fridge. She put a tiny bottle in front of my nose. It smelled like.\u2009.\u2009. citrus: zingy and fresh and immediately identifiable as sour if eaten. I would have liked to eat it, but I did not want it on my body. I shook my head no. Aftel gave me another. If it had been the first I would have described it, too, as merely \u2018\u2018citrus,\u2019\u2019 but now it was wildly different. Again: edible but not wearable. She repeated this again and again; already my palate was becoming more sophisticated. I finally gave an enthusiastic yes to an oil that smelled like tea; it was somehow deeper than the others, less abrasive. \u2018\u2018This is yellow mandarin,\u2019\u2019 Aftel said. \u2018\u2018Yellow mandarin is like a tangerine, but it\u2019s got a very floral back note to it.\u2019\u2019 She dipped a paper strip and planted it into a book with an accordionlike structure that served as a holder. We were done with the citruses.\u2018\u2018This smells piney to me,\u2019\u2019 I said, upon receiving the next scent.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s a wood,\u2019\u2019 she confirmed.I disliked it, and told her so, and we moved on without discussing what it was.This volleying continued for another hour. She gave me blood cedar and pencil shavings from Virginia. There was an olive extract and something I thought was grapefruit but was really juniper berry. Saffron, mushrooms, cranberry absolute, tarragon, petrified rock-badger poop, partially crystallized sarsaparilla, castoreum (a beaver secretion), roasted seashells, orris butter (\u2018\u2018it can go toward old lady in a hot second\u2019\u2019), something that smelled like the reptile room at the Bronx Zoo. Strangely, I couldn\u2019t identify the smell of coffee blindly, and I had to swab my nose with rubbing alcohol after somehow dunking it in lavender oil.By the end, I had in front of me a fan of dozens of glistening paper strips, including some dipped in oak moss (the smell of lichen, like a wet forest), jasmine, siam wood, the \u2018\u2018very expensive and very hard to get 4-vinylguaiacol\u2019\u2019 (a leathery derivative of guaiac wood, once used to treat syphilis), and, my favorite, indole, which I\u2019m ashamed to report that, though present in certain flowers, also appears in human feces.Aftel separated the strips into top notes, middle notes and base notes, and asked me to organize them on the organ from favorite to least, so she could record my ranking. I left feeling dizzy and a bit drunk.A few weeks later, a UPS package arrived. Nestled inside a padded foil envelope was, as a heavy ecru card indicated, \u2018\u2018Alice\u2019s Perfume,\u2019\u2019 in several forms: bottles large and small, a beeswax solid. I sat on the floor, tore away the paisley tissue paper, freed the largest of the bottles, unscrewed the cap and inhaled. It was almost nauseatingly rich; my throat contracted, and my eyes watered with pleasure. The fragrance was loamy, primeval, a tiny bit putrid. I\u2019ve worn it nine months now, and each morning when I spray it on my wrists, I\u2019m overcome with a feeling of awe at my own good fortune. I think of something Aftel said under that fig tree, that \u2018\u2018luxury is sold as general, but it\u2019s actually very specific.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s true: What could be more luxuriously specific than being granted access to a pleasure you had never even thought to pursue?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Your Portfolio Needs Plenty of Stocks, Whatever Your Age", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byRetiringWHEN I went to work on Wall Street in 1972, it was an article of faith that older investors should own less common stock than young ones. One rule of thumb suggested that your equity exposure should equal 100 percent minus your age: 70 percent for a 30-year-old, for example, but just 35 percent for someone who is 65.Since then, investment practices have evolved considerably, but on the question of how much common stock to own \u2014 the single most important question governing investment returns \u2014 not much has changed.Typical recommendations nowadays propose greater equity exposure than they did 40 years ago, but it is still the overwhelming view among investment counselors that people should reduce their holdings of common stock and beef up their ownership of bonds as they grow older.Problem is, it wasn\u2019t very good advice back then, and it\u2019s still poor advice today.I know this opinion puts me in the minority, but if you are a retiree or nearing retirement, you should hear me out.Let\u2019s begin with the standard view today.Customer representatives at Vanguard, one of the largest investment managers in the world, generally refrain from offering unsolicited financial advice. Still, when you log in to your account at Vanguard, you will see two pie charts. One shows your current asset allocation and one shows what Vanguard\u2019s algorithm (based solely on your age) thinks that allocation should be. Something similar is suggested by most other investment firms and financial advisers.If you happen to be like my daughter or son \u2014 both in their mid-30s \u2014 Vanguard will propose a target asset allocation that is 90 percent stocks and 10 percent bonds. For a 69-year-old like me, however, the default suggestion is 45 percent stocks and 55 percent bonds. Vanguard offers a disclaimer noting that it has not taken \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d into consideration.Assuming all of us followed the preferred allocation, our family\u2019s financial assets would collectively be less than 50 percent equities because my wife and I have a lot more money than our children. But if we died in a plane crash tomorrow, and the children inherited our money, the recommendation for how to allocate those same assets would shoot up to 90 percent stocks.Isn\u2019t that a little strange?I\u2019m not picking on Vanguard; I hold most of my investments in Vanguard index funds and their recommendations mirror what the rest of the industry preaches. Indeed, the \u201ctarget-date funds\u201d of Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock and the Capital Group all allocate 84 to 97 percent stocks for people who plan to retire in 2045 versus 52 to 61 percent for those planning to retire in 2020.I asked Maria Bruno, a senior analyst specializing in retirement-related strategies for Vanguard, to explain the reasoning behind those allocations. \u201cAs you age and your time horizon shortens, you need to diversify by increasing your exposure to bonds,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will help mitigate the short-term volatility of your portfolio that derives mainly from the equity component.\u201dThis consensus view, though, rests on a fallacy: the belief that as people grow older, their investment horizon shortens and, therefore, their ability to withstand volatility diminishes considerably.I would argue, instead, that there is an insufficient appreciation of just how apt the metaphor of the \u201cinvestment horizon\u201d is. Just as a sailor sees but never reaches the horizon, the same is true for nearly all investors.A just-retired 66-year-old might expect that her assets will need to support her for a further life expectancy of only 20 to 21 years. But what happens if she treats that actuarial expectation as a certainty, spends too much each year, and ends up healthy and vigorous at age 87 with no assets left?At 87, the average woman can expect to live another six to seven years \u2014 a healthy woman, even longer. And she might get \u201cunlucky\u201d and live to be 100, in which case her assets will need to support a retirement of 34 years.The prudent course for any retiree is to plan on a longer-than-normal life. Retirees typically liquidate only a small portion of their assets every year. Accordingly, the mere act of retiring should not prompt any change in your exposure to the financial asset \u2014 common stock \u2014 that is almost certain to produce the highest returns over the long run.But what if there\u2019s a bear market? \u201cNo big deal,\u201d I say. As long as you don\u2019t panic and sell most of your holdings at the worst times, your annual withdrawals are limited. As a result, you should not really worry about fluctuations in the stock market.Not worry about the volatility of the market? True enough, sometimes you\u2019ll be selling when the stock market is depressed, but at other times you\u2019ll be selling when the stock market is elevated.On average, you\u2019ll be liquidating your positions at average prices and, over time, you will earn the average performance of the stock market. And the long-established truth is that a diversified collection of stocks, over most any reasonable time period, will outperform the average performance of bonds.But what happens when our healthy, vigorous retiree gets to be 99? Surely there is not much time left. That is true: She is fast approaching her personal horizon. But her assets have not reached their horizon. They will be bequeathed to her children, or other relatives and friends, perhaps a few favorite charities \u2014 extending the horizon anew.I can count on one hand the number of people who have said to me that they don\u2019t care about any relatives, friends or charities and that it is their intention to spend all of their money \u2014 ideally running the balance down to zero \u2014 on the day they die.It is the realization that the investment horizon is long and that it is continuously receding that leads us in the direction of a correct asset allocation. And that means we should not reduce exposure to the stock market as we age.But what is the correct allocation between stocks and bonds? My answer to that question will come next week.David A. Levine is a former chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, now a unit of AllianceBernstein, who also founded and ran the firm\u2019s fixed-income department.First of two Retiring columns on investment allocation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caution Rebuffed, Unicorns and Other Start-Ups Fixate on Rainbows", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byBut in Silicon Valley, ask any start-up entrepreneur about the shifting economic environment and the answer often goes like this:\u201cI haven\u2019t changed anything since this all started,\u201d said Manav Mital, the chief executive of Instart Logic, which speeds the delivery of computing services to customers.\u201cThe pullback hasn\u2019t affected our hiring plans at all,\u201d said David Vivero, the chief executive of Amino, a free service that matches patients with doctors for appointments. He added that he was looking to increase his work force by about a third.Nor has the downturn changed life at Gusto, a payroll management start-up. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the shift,\u201d said Joshua Reeves, a founder of the company. \u201cEven in downturns, some businesses succeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always the other guy who will suffer,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has invested in the ride-hailing company Uber and the food-delivery start-up Munchery. \u201cI\u2019m no psychologist, but all the people we\u2019ve backed have never been average. They never think the things that happen to average people will happen to them.\u201dEntrepreneurs\u2019 confidence levels remain buoyant even though investors are telling them that the change from go-go-go times to merely go-go will have consequences.The message from Rory O\u2019Driscoll, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, that entrepreneurs should be more careful is often ignored.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a company where the pullback in funding hasn\u2019t been discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a person has had a conversation about this 10 times and it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet\u2026 \u201dMr. O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s voice trailed off. \u201cI\u2019m tired and grumpy because I\u2019ve had three of these conversations today and in every one you have the same discussion,\u201d he said.For now, start-up entrepreneurs are operating much as they did during the recent boom times. Data from Jobvite, a recruiting service used by start-ups, show no drop in hiring activity or salaries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Well-appointed offices that look like photo shoots for Design Within Reach and perks like free Uber rides and in-house meals remain common at the companies.\u201cThe narrative of start-up comeuppance is in the air, but we haven\u2019t seen a statistically significant change in food budgets,\u201d said Arram Sabeti, the chief executive of ZeroCater, which serves meals to tech companies.In fact, the food from tech companies that goes uneaten is piling up. \u201cTwo years ago, we picked up 15 tons of food a week and now we\u2019re picking up 17 tons a week,\u201d said Mary Risley, whose group Food Runners in San Francisco distributes leftover office food to the city\u2019s homeless residents. She attributes the increase largely to start-ups.\u201cI\u2019ve been reading a lot about a slowdown and asking myself about what it means, but we just closed a substantial round of funding,\u201d said Mr. Mital, characterizing his recent financing as \u201cone of the easiest fund-raisings we\u2019ve had.\u201dThe air of detachment pervades the talk. Shan Sinha, the chief executive of the video conferencing start-up Highfive, said his customers were discussing ways to save money over the coming months.

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Updates Bank Stress Test Beyond Pass/Fail", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 European regulators provided details on Wednesday for the latest stress test aimed at measuring the ability of the region\u2019s lenders to survive a financial crisis or severe economic downturn.Unlike tests in past years, the latest test will not have a minimum capital threshold that lenders will have to meet in order to pass. As a result, no bank can actually fail \u2014 or pass \u2014 the examination, according to the European Banking Authority, which regulates lenders in the European Union.Instead, local banking supervisors like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will use the results to determine whether banks need to take additional action, such as raising capital.The test will examine the balance sheets of 51 European banks, representing 70 percent of the region\u2019s banking industry, the authority said. The results are expected to be announced in the third quarter.\u201cThe stress test is designed to provide supervisors, banks and other market participants with a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of E.U. banks to economic shocks,\u201d the authority said in a statement.Several of the region\u2019s biggest lenders, including Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, have reported large annual losses for 2015 and are revamping their operations, including selling underperforming lines of business.European bank stocks have also declined sharply this month as investor concern grows over rapidly declining oil prices, an economic slowdown and bad loans.It is unclear how comprehensive this year\u2019s test will be in terms of assessing the overall health of the banking sector.No banks in Portugal will be part of the examination, which will also look at only one bank in Greece and spare several Italian lenders.In 2014, the regulator examined the balance sheets of 123 of the region\u2019s lenders, identifying 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and would need additional buffers to be prepared for an economic downturn.The latest tests will include several banks in Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries that are not part of the eurozone and are not regulated by the European Central Bank.The European Central Bank has said it will conduct its own stress test of institutions that it regulates but that are not subject to the European Banking Authority\u2019s examination. The central bank has said that its examination would be consistent with the methodology used by the banking authority, but that it would \u201calso give due consideration to the lower size and complexity of these institutions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Negative 0.5% Interest Rate: Why People Are Paying to Save", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byBelow ZeroWhen you lend somebody money, they usually have to pay you for the privilege.That has been a bedrock assumption across centuries of financial history. But it is an assumption that is increasingly being tossed aside by some of the world\u2019s central banks and bond markets.A decade ago, negative interest rates were a theoretical curiosity that economists would discuss almost as a parlor game. Two years ago, it began showing up as an unconventional step that a few small countries considered. Now, it is the stated policy of some of the most powerful global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.On Thursday, Sweden\u2019s central bank lowered its bank lending rate to a negative 0.5 percent from a negative 0.35 percent, and said it could cut further still; European bank stocks were hammered partly because investors feared what negative rates could do to bank profits. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, acknowledged in congressional testimony Wednesday and Thursday that the American central bank was taking a look at the strategy, though she emphasized no such move was envisioned.But as negative rates \u2014 in which depositors pay to hold money in bank accounts \u2014 become a more common fixture, there are many unknowns about what these policies mean for finance, for the economy and even for the definition of money.These are some of the key questions, and, where we have them, the answers.So how do negative interest rates work?It depends. In the cases of interest rate targets set by central banks like the E.C.B. and Swedish Riksbank, they set a negative target rate for banks, and banks in turn pass it along to their customers. The E.C.B., for example, currently has a negative 0.3 percent rate, meaning that when banks deposit money at the central bank overnight, they pay for the privilege.Banks have different ways of passing the negative rates on to depositors, often framed as fees for keeping money in an account, which is basically negative interest rates by another name.Bond markets reflect these negative rates, too, including for longer-term government debt. For example, if you bought a two-year Swiss government bond on Thursday, you would have needed to pay a price that resulted in a yield of negative 1.12 percent. Even 10-year Swiss bonds have a negative rate, a sign markets expect below-zero rates to persist in Switzerland for many years to come.But don\u2019t people just withdraw cash rather than pay to deposit it at their bank or buy a government bond that will give them back less than they paid?You\u2019d think, right? This was exactly why economists had long thought that negative interest rates were impossible. It helps explain why central banks first turned to other tools, including quantitative easing, when they saw a need to ease monetary policy despite interest rates that were already near zero.But it looks as if the convenience of keeping money in a bank account is worth a small negative interest rate or fees for most consumers and businesses, at least at the only slightly negative rates currently in place. Storing and providing security for cash may be more expensive than a small bank charge.When initial experiments in Switzerland and Sweden didn\u2019t result in mass withdrawals from the banking system, larger central banks in need of easier money moved gingerly in the same direction. They\u2019ll stop when either their economies start to grow or they see more concrete evidence that negative rates are doing more harm than good.How is this supposed to help the economy?Pretty much the same way it always is supposed to help the economy when a central bank cuts rates. Lower rates encourage business investment and consumer spending; increase the value of the stock market and other risky assets; lower the value of a country\u2019s currency, making exporters more competitive; and create expectations of higher future inflation, which can induce people to spend now.We have decades of experience with central banks trying to manage the economy by, for example, cutting bank rates to 2 percent from 3 percent when there is an economic downturn. The shift to negative rate policies is, hypothetically at least, the same, but with a starting point of rates already around zero.So does it work?It\u2019s hard to say with any certainty yet. At a minimum, it seems to have an effect of lowering the value of a currency, which makes export industries very happy. It\u2019s less clear whether it can help create sustained economic growth, particularly when the hard-to-calculate downsides are factored in.What are those downsides?The global financial system is built on an assumption of above-zero interest rates. Going below zero could cause damage to the very architecture by which money and credit zoom through the economy, and in turn inhibit growth.Banks could cease to be viable businesses, eliminating a key way that money is channeled from savers to productive investments. Money market mutual funds, widely used in the United States, could well cease to exist. Insurance companies and pension funds could face their own major strains.Is the Federal Reserve going to do this in the United States?Janet Yellen doesn\u2019t think so. But in two days of congressional testimony this week, she also didn\u2019t rule it out.For one thing, the United States economy, and particularly its labor market, looks to be in stronger shape than that of many others around the world. So the Fed expects to be in interest-rate raising mode this year (though exactly how fast is very much in question). But even if the economy does take a turn for the worse, there\u2019s no certainty that negative rates are the path the Fed would take.She also said that \u201cit isn\u2019t just a question of legal authority.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a question of could the plumbing of the payment system in the United States handle it?\u201d she said. \u201cIs our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? We\u2019ve not determined that.\u201dMs. Yellen noted that the rates on Treasury bills could go negative even in the absence of a policy shift by the Fed, as has happened a few times in the past.So what are some of the weird things that could happen in a world in which negative rates become routine?The policies in Europe and Japan are still relatively new and involve rates only slightly below zero. But if the policies become long-lasting, or negative rates go much lower, there are a lot of mind-bending ways it could affect routine transactions.For example, would people start prepaying years\u2019 worth of cable bills to avoid having money tied up in a money-losing bank account? How about property taxes? Would companies and governments put in place new policies prohibiting people from paying their bills too early?Or consider this: Many commercial transactions now take place with some short-term credit attached \u2014 for example, a company that gets a 60-day grace period to pay bills from its suppliers. Would that flip, and suddenly suppliers would prohibit upfront payment and insist that their customers wait 60 days to pay?Might new businesses sprout up that allow people to securely store thousands of dollars in bundles of $100 bills, or could people buy physical objects as stores of value that the banks can\u2019t charge a negative interest rate on?videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cut Compensation at Investment Banks, Then Take Cover", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneLong gone are the days on Wall Street when our leading investment banks were stock-market highfliers.That seems like a long time ago now. Not a single one of the leading American investment banks \u2013 supposedly the best in the world \u2013 trades above its book value. They trade like utilities. Goldman trades at 0.86 times its book value; Morgan Stanley trades at 0.74 times its book value; and Bank of America, which now owns Merrill Lynch, trades at just more than half its book value. JPMorgan Chase, our largest bank by asset size, trades just below its book value. (The dynamic is even worse in Europe, where the big banks seem to be melting down in real time.)What gives? And is there any chance the market will ever again take a more charitable view of the value of these so-called \u201cToo Big To Fail\u201d banks?Not if the apostate Neel T. Kashkari has his way. He is the former Goldman Sachs junior banker who was recently appointed president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.In a speech on Feb. 16 at the Brookings Institution that could just as easily been given by Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Kashkari advocated breaking up the big banks \u201cinto smaller, less connected, less important entities\u201d and \u201ctaxing leverage\u201d throughout the financial system \u201cto reduce systemic risks.\u201d He also called for the big banks to become more like \u201cpublic utilities\u201d by \u201cforcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can\u2019t fail.\u201dWhen Mr. Kashkari, a Republican candidate for governor of California who lost to Jerry Brown in 2014, starts sounding like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the time has come for the leaders on Wall Street to take matters into their own hands and shake up the way these companies are managed before others do it for them.At the top of the list, as I have written before, is the need to revamp the Wall Street compensation system, which is Wall Street\u2019s largest single variable cost and continues to reward bankers, traders and executives for taking risks with other people\u2019s money.This cannot continue. The compensation system must be changed so that the leaders of these companies have their full net worth on the line as they did when the businesses were still private partnerships. And there is little choice but for the overall compensation on Wall Street to fall further than it already has in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Part of the reason Wall Street companies are trading like utilities these days is that, generally speaking, their return on equity has been so dismal. Quarter after quarter, these companies struggle to break the 10 percent threshold that in the old days would have been considered an abject failure.Return on equity, or R.O.E., is important because it measures a corporation\u2019s profitability by showing how much profit a company makes with the money shareholders have invested.Goldman, which as a private partnership used to have a return on equity of more than 50 percent, had a return in 2015 of 7.4 percent. At Morgan Stanley, the return for 2015 was 7.8 percent.There are reasons for this, too: New regulations require that the banks have more equity capital and that they get out of the riskiest business lines \u2014 such as proprietary trading \u2014 that occasionally generated huge profits but sometimes led to huge losses.As a result, the denominator of the return on equity calculation \u2013 equity \u2013 is higher while the numerator \u2014 net income \u2014 is lower. The combination of the two results in returns on equity that are underwhelming, disappoint investors and result in stock prices that value these companies below their book value.What can be done? Either the return on equity benchmark has to be junked and replaced by another ratio that better judges the new realities on Wall Street or Wall Street has to become more profitable. Since return on equity looks like it is here to stay, that leaves one option: Wall Street has to become more profitable if it wants to avoid the worse option of being broken up into smaller pieces. And the only way to do that is to reduce the largest variable cost these firms have: compensation.What the leaders on Wall Street need to do to get their stocks roaring again is to cut compensation. They should reverse-engineer their income statements to increase their profits. If the market is demanding a return on equity of, say, 15 percent, then each quarter, the big banks should solve for the compensation expense that will yield a 15 percent return on equity. For instance, at Goldman in 2015, compensation expense was $12.68 billion, or 37.5 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.For Goldman to achieve a return of 15 percent on its equity capital of $76 billion, it needs to generate an annual net income of $11.4 billion. To have achieved that amount in 2015, it would have needed to increase its reported net income of $6 billion by another $5.4 billion. The obvious place to find that money is by reducing compensation expense by that amount, or by 43 percent.Obviously, the idea of cutting compensation at Goldman Sachs by 43 percent will not be popular among the people who work at Goldman Sachs. But it still would mean they get paid more for working at Goldman than they could doing anything else without putting their own capital at risk.Investment bankers by their very nature are the most risk-averse people on the planet. Where else can you work and get paid huge salaries without risking your own capital? My bet is the compensation on Wall Street can be cut in half and most of the people who work there will stay put.This is what must happen given the new realities of life on Wall Street. Either Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn can make this happen at Goldman on their own or something even worse can be forced upon them by the likes of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Kashkari.An earlier version of this article misstated what Morgan Stanley shares are trading for in relation to their book value. They are trading at 0.74 times book value, not 0.69 times.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street.

{"Headline": "Palau vs. the Poachers", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "FeatureThe island nation has mounted an aggressive response to illegal fishing in their waters. How they protect themselves may help the rest of the world save all of the oceans.Supported byCaught fishing in a marine sanctuary, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 was fleeing to Indonesian waters, beyond Palau\u2019s jurisdiction. Once across the boundary, the crew could easily unload its catch at a local wharf and disappear among the thousands of small Filipino or Indonesian islands of the western Pacific. Determined not to let that happen, the Remeliik\u2019s skipper, running on Bergman\u2019s coordinates, was pushing 15 knots \u2014 a pace that worried its engineer. But the police were desperate to keep up. In the previous six months, they had spotted but failed to capture nearly a dozen other pirate fishing ships. If the Remeliik\u2019s officers miscalculated their heading by even a small fraction of a degree, they would miss their target.Bergman had been tracking the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 for weeks, and emailed an alert about possible illegal fishing two days earlier. Before moving to West Virginia to work for SkyTruth, he spent three years working as a marine ob\u00adserver on Alaskan fishing boats, logging the details of the daily catch, as required by federal and state fishery authorities. At SkyTruth, Bergman did his surveillance work from a far greater remove, monitoring ships by satellite. For months, he had been studying a satellite feed from above Palau. He knew its squiggles and slashes by memory. A passenger boat out of Pitcairn Island appeared every few weeks; a United States Navy ship from Diego Garcia conducted regular maneuvers; a Chinese research vessel was doing a survey of some sort in a grid pattern; a Taiwanese ship that never seemed to fish made repeated trips out to meet other long-line fishing vessels. The Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 stood out, however. Switching among registries of fishing permits, regional tuna licenses and blacklisted vessels, he could tell it had no license to fish in Palau\u2019s waters, even though its zigzag trajectory indicated it was doing just that.In response to Bergman\u2019s alert, an international team gathered into the cramped, second-floor police command center on Koror, Palau\u2019s most populous island. There were three local police officers, an adviser from the Pew Charitable Trusts and two Australian Navy officers, on loan to Palau to advise on everything from running the Remeliik (which the Australians had also donated) to using satellite-data analysis software. Working through the night and the following day, the team radioed the information they received from West Virginia to Allison Baiei, a Palauan marine police officer, aboard the Remeliik.Police efforts like these, coordinated and international in scope, are a rarity when it comes to enforcing the law at sea, but the alternative is usually no enforcement at all. More than two-thirds of the planet is covered by water, and much of that liquid expanse is ungoverned and potentially ungovernable. Criminal enterprise has flourished in the breach. The global black market for seafood is worth more than $20 billion, and approximately one in every five fish consumed globally is caught illegally.After a 51-hour push, much of it through heavy seas, the Remeliik\u2019s unrelenting pace finally paid off: It caught up with the Taiwanese ship just a few miles before the boundary with Indonesian waters. The officers escorted the ship back to port in Palau, and when they inspected the hold, Baiei told me, they found an especially grim haul. Inside, among the stacks of tuna, were hundreds of severed shark fins. The officers piled the contraband onto the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33\u2019s deck and, when they ran out of room there, piled the rest into a bloody heap on the dock. They counted, measured and photographed the fins to use for the eventual prosecution, then dumped them into the sea. \u2018\u2018Disgusting,\u2019\u2019 was all Baiei would say about the scene.In the face of this challenge, Palau has mounted an aggressive response. In 2006, it was among the first nations to ban bottom trawling \u2014 a practice not unlike strip mining in which fishing boats drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor to catch the fish in the waters just above, killing virtually everything else in their path. In 2009, it prohibited commercial shark fishing in its waters, creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary. In 2015, it announced plans to require observers aboard all its tuna longliners. (Elsewhere in the region, observers are aboard just one in 50 tuna longliners.) Palau has also teamed up with Greenpeace, which helped patrol its territorial waters, and it started a campaign on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, raising more than $50,000 to support its conservation work. Palau\u2019s most radical move, though, was creating a \u2018\u2018no take\u2019\u2019 reserve in 2015. Within this zone, which encompasses 193,000 square miles, all export fishing (along with any drilling or mining) will be strictly prohibited.From one perspective, Palau\u2019s work suggests a hopeful future. It offers a model for successful ad hoc collaboration among countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations. Palau has also emerged as a testing ground for some of the technology \u2014 including drones, satellite monitoring and military-grade radar \u2014 that might finally empower countries to spot and arrest the pirates, poachers, polluters, traffickers and other scofflaws who prowl the seas with impunity.But Palau\u2019s conservation efforts are really motivated by a more immediate sense of self-preservation. In September, I sat down with Palau\u2019s president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., in his cluttered, wood-paneled office in Koror. A sturdy man with an intense stare, Remengesau explained to me that more than half of Palau\u2019s gross domestic product comes from tourism, mostly people visiting to dive on Palau\u2019s reefs, which house more fish, coral and other invertebrates per square mile than virtually anywhere else on Earth. Remengesau boiled the problem down to simple economics, noting that sharks were an especially big draw for undersea sightseers. Alive, an individual shark is worth more than $170,000 annually in tourism dollars, he said, or nearly $2 million over its lifetime. Dead, each can go for a hundred dollars \u2014 and usually, he added, that money winds up in the pockets of a foreign poacher.The poachers calculate differently, of course. More than a dozen countries, including Palau and Taiwan, have banned shark-finning. But demand for the fins, especially in Asia, remains high. Shark-fin soup, which can cost more than $100 a bowl, has for centuries signified wealth and status, and it became especially popular in the late 1980s as a status item for China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle and upper classes. Ship captains often allow their crew members to supplement their income by keeping the fins for themselves to sell at port. Shark carcasses take up valuable hold space in smaller ships, and as they decompose, they produce ammonia that contaminates the other catch. Deckhands usually cut off the fins, which can sell for 100 times the cost of the rest of the meat. They then throw the rest of the shark back into the water. It\u2019s a slow death: The sharks sink to the sea floor, where they starve, drown or are eaten by other fish.In a given year, Palau faces 50 to 100 incursions by pirate vessels. Fish ignore borders \u2014 and, it turns out, so do many of the people pursuing them. While port inspections, wheel-room cameras, locational transponders and onboard observers are essential to better monitoring the oceans, policing is the only thing that will make Palau\u2019s new reserve, and others like it elsewhere in the world, more than just lines drawn on the water.The oceans belong to everyone and no one, and the general perception is that they are too big to need protection. We also tend to think of fish as an ever-regenerating crop, there forever for our taking. But roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s ocean stocks are depleted or overexploited; one study predicts that by 2050, the sea could contain more plastic waste than fish. Though most governments have neither the inclination nor the resources to patrol the oceans, Palau is trying a different approach, and whether it succeeds or fails may have consequences for the entire planet.The plan was to patrol the waters near Kayangel, an atoll in the country\u2019s far north, an area popular for sea-cucumber and coral-fish poachers. A tiny, rugged fleck of land, roughly half a square mile, Kayangel has perhaps 60 year-round residents; there is no airstrip, and power and cell service are erratic. Local fishermen had spotted poachers near the atoll, and our patrol was meant to show a police presence in the area.For any given patrol, the chief of the marine police weighs a list of variables \u2014 credible threat, distance to target, available crew, sufficient fuel, weather \u2014 and decides if it\u2019s worth dispatching the Remeliik. Today, we would head out instead on one of the department\u2019s two much smaller fiberglass boats, which they use in shallow waters closer to shore. When we pulled out of port, the sea was glass-flat, but as the land behind us fell beneath the horizon, we began rolling in 10-foot swells \u2014 it was clear why this smaller boat was ill-suited to chasing poachers into deeper water.Baiei said the turning point for Palau, the moment when the nation realized that it needed help, was March 29, 2012. The other officers shook their heads at the mere mention of the date. The agonizing story began earlier that month, when two Chinese poacher boats were spotted near the atoll for several days in a row. They kept escaping: Each was equipped with three 60-horsepower outboard motors, while the local wildlife rangers had only a Zodiac with one outboard motor.Around 7 a.m. on March 29, the Palauan rangers saw one of the Chinese boats again. This time they got close enough to try to shoot out its engines, Baiei said. They hit an engine, but they also hit a Chinese deckhand, Lu Yong. (Palauan rangers say they were not aiming for him; the bullets ricocheted off the engines.) The rangers called for help to rush Lu, 35, to a nearby island where a nurse lived, but he bled to death before they got there. He had a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter in mainland China. But the day would only get more tragic from there.Boarding the Chinese boat and interrogating the rest of the crew, the Palauan rangers soon learned that there was a larger \u2018\u2018mother ship\u2019\u2019 farther at sea, orchestrating the poaching raids. This was too far for the small Zodiac to travel, so two Palauan policemen, Willie Mays Towai and Earlee Decherong, along with an American pilot, Frank Ohlinger, were dispatched in a rented single-engine Cessna to find the ship and call in its coordinates.As night fell, the pilot got lost, and the plane vanished. Meanwhile, about 35 miles from shore, another team, aboard the Remeliik, finally discovered the 80-foot mother ship, which immediately bolted, ignoring several warning shots fired across its bow. After several hours of running, though, the mother ship drifted to a halt. It was soon engulfed in flames, most likely from an intentional fire set to hide any evidence of poaching. The pirate crew scrambled into a lifeboat just before the ship sank, and they were arrested shortly thereafter.The Cessna pilot and the two policemen were still lost, wandering somewhere above the Pacific. The authorities on land came up with an idea: If they could illuminate the islands brightly enough, the pilot might see them and find his way back home. The public safety director ordered all emergency vehicles to drive to the highest points in Koror and turn on their flashing lights. \u2018\u2018Aim spotlights upward,\u2019\u2019 yachters were instructed. The stadium lights at Palau\u2019s Asahi baseball field were switched on. Residents were asked to turn on all household lights. Some stood in the streets waving flashlights. Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, who happened to be vacationing in Palau, provided the two helicopters on his 414-foot mega-yacht, the Octopus, for search and rescue. Allen\u2019s crew was instructed to fire 49 flares, one per minute, into the air. An official in Angaur, an island on the nation\u2019s southern tip, suggested setting some of the outer-atoll wooded areas on fire \u2014 a plan that was quickly dismissed.Back at the command center on Koror, several police officers were trying in vain to contact the plane. Its radio was malfunctioning. They could hear Ohlinger, but he could not hear them. For nearly five hours, culminating in a mayday call at 8:16 p.m., they listened to his growing panic, his rage at the plane\u2019s broken GPS unit and compass and, ultimately, his request that someone alert his next of kin. \u2018\u2018On a good glide slope, heading north,\u2019\u2019 Ohlinger said, as he explained that he and his two passengers planned to crash-land into the sea. \u2018\u2018We are at 6,000 feet, doing 65 knots, out of fuel,\u2019\u2019 were his last words. The wreckage was never found.The major innovation, the one that in the 1930s helped transform fishing from hunting to something more akin to industrial mining, was the giant-scale purse seiner \u2014 a ship that surrounds an entire school of fish with a curtain of netting, sometimes nearly a mile around, then cinches it like a laundry bag. But more innovations followed. World War II gave incentive to the creation of lighter, faster, more durable ships that could travel farther on less fuel. Submarine combat drove improvements in sonar, which turned the ocean top into a glass table, making visible the unseen fathoms below. Subzero onboard freezers freed fishermen from their race against melting refrigerator ice. Innovations in plastics and monofilaments lengthened fishing lines from feet to miles. Lightweight polymer-based nets enabled supertrawlers to rake the ocean even more brutally.But, as the Palauans and their allies are discovering, technology can also be deployed for conservation. Just as authorities can use tracking devices and satellite data to monitor the activities of people on land, they are increasingly able to do so at sea. Since the 1990s, ships have deployed the Automatic Identification System, or A.I.S., a once-voluntary collision-avoidance system whereby onboard VHF transmitters convey their position, identity and speed continuously to other ships and to satellites. In 2002, the United Nations\u2019 maritime organization mandated A.I.S. for nearly all passenger ships regardless of size, and commercial ships, fishing vessels included, with a gross tonnage of more than 300 (typically, that\u2019s a 130-foot long vessel) in international waters.A.I.S. has its shortcomings. Captains are allowed to turn the transponders off when they perceive a credible danger of being tracked by pirates \u2014 a gaping loophole for poachers. The system can be hacked to give false locations. Many of the ships involved in the worst crimes, like the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, are smaller than 300 tonnes and thus exempt from the system entirely. Partly as a response to the deficiencies of A.I.S., many countries now also require fishing vessels to carry an additional device called a vessel-monitoring system, or V.M.S. Typically, this takes the form of a cone-shaped antenna on the roof of the wheelhouse, wired to a locked transceiver and the ship\u2019s control panel, that transmits their location and other data to local fishery authorities at all times.More sea-traffic data may become available soon as countries consider deploying devices in the water \u2014 sonar and camera buoys, as well as low-cost floating hydrophones \u2014 to catch ships approaching restricted areas. Even storm clouds, which long concealed many crimes at sea, no longer pose as much of an obstacle. Satellites armed with syn\u00adthetic-aperture radar can detect a vessel\u2019s position regardless of weather conditions. All this data becomes especially useful when coupled with sophisticated software whose algorithms can trigger alerts \u2014 if, for instance, a vessel goes \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 by turning off its transponder, if it zigzags in certain formations that indicate that it\u2019s fishing or if it enters a forbidden area. Now, instead of blindly patrolling broad swaths of ocean, the police can target their efforts.Still, the most reliable form of ocean law enforcement continues to be real-time direct surveillance, which is neither easy nor cheap. Generating close-in imagery from the sky depends predominantly on military-grade drones. Ordering up high-resolution photographs from space is still extremely costly, sometimes more than $3,500 per picture, and the company or government that operates the satellite often requires the request for the image to be made days in advance, so operators can aim the lens at the right location on its next trip hurtling around the Earth. Palau experimented with smaller, commercially available drones in 2013, in a project funded by an Australian mining magnate, Andrew Forrest. But the drones proved to be too expensive and hard to fly, and the cameras mounted on the drones gave too tightly circumscribed a view of the waters below.The eventual dream is to create systems that pull all the antipoaching intelligence together in real time, giving the police and their helpers a God\u2019s-eye view of their adversaries. In 2014, SkyTruth joined with Google and the nonprofit group Oceana to build Global Fishing Watch, a website that will allow an army of would-be Bjorn Bergmans to track A.I.S. data on roughly 80,000 vessels worldwide. Last year, Pew teamed up with a British company called Satellite Applications Catapult to create a virtual \u2018\u2018watch room\u2019\u2019 program that, drawing on live satellite tracking data, displays a map of the world traversed by lighted dots, each one a fishing vessel. Even as the vastness of the oceans makes it easy for poachers to escape, technology is also making it harder for them to hide.Many valuable fish species \u2014 including tuna, blue marlin and mahi-mahi \u2014 huddle near floating objects for protection and mating. FADs take advantage of this instinct, attracting fish in spectacularly dense schools that fishermen quickly scoop up. \u2018\u2018Drifting\u2019\u2019 FADs are unanchored: Fishermen track them by following the currents. \u2018\u2018Moored\u2019\u2019 FADs are tethered to the ocean floor, typically with concrete blocks. Increasingly, fishing companies are deploying \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 FADs equipped with sonar and GPS, enabling operators to sit back and wait for an alert when it\u2019s time to retrieve their haul.The global popularity of FADs is, at least in part, an unintended consequence of the movement to save dolphins. Commercial fishing fleets once found tuna by looking for dolphins, which follow tuna schools and swim near the surface above them. In the 1980s and 1990s, the push for \u2018\u2018dolphin free\u2019\u2019 tuna drove many of these fishermen from the Eastern Tropical Pacific, near Baja, to the Central and Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, where the dolphins typically don\u2019t follow tuna. In making this move, many of these ships turned to FADs as their new tactic \u2014 even though the devices are widely criticized for further industrializing the harvest of fast-disappearing species like sharks, sea turtles and tuna.On one patrol with Baiei, we stopped at a FAD so that I could dive in for a closer look. Bathwater-warm, the ocean was translucent turquoise, the current as strong as a river. The FAD was low-tech and anchored, just a plastic buoy attached to a thick, mollusk-coated rope tethered to the ocean floor more than 500 feet below. Large bamboo leaves ran down the first 50 feet of the rope, flapping like fuzzy moth wings. Hundreds of tiny silver fish darted under the shade of the leaves. Not one fish was more than a foot long.We visited three more FADs during the patrol that day, traversing more than 100 miles. All were barren. The fish, Baiei explained, were all being taken before they could even come to the reserve. Tuna, like many large ocean fish, are migratory. Even if their natural path might take them to the safety of Palau\u2019s asylum, they can be picked off beforehand in any number of ways \u2014 including by being netted at one of the more than 50,000 floating FADs in the Western and Central Pacific, most of which are perfectly legal.In recent years, a handful of countries have tried to slow the ocean plunder. They have limited trawling, put caps on FAD numbers and imposed rules to limit \u2018\u2018bycatch,\u2019\u2019 the unwanted species caught in the hunt for prized fish. Perhaps the most promising tactic has been to create more no-take reserves like Palau\u2019s. In 2014, the Obama administration added 400,000 square miles of similarly protected territory to United States waters. In 2015, the British government announced its intent to establish the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve (322,000 square miles) around the Pitcairn Islands. But these reserves work only if they are well policed. Otherwise, they become magnets for poachers who see them as robust and competition-free zones. And, as we saw at our own little FAD, even a well-policed reserve is not enough to protect the fish who freely swim outside their safe zones. Presently such reserves cover around 2 percent of the world\u2019s seas, but many oceanographers say we need to cover at least 10 percent to make a substantial difference.As the sun set, one marine officer said he wanted to check a final FAD near an islet called Orak, this time in hopes of landing a few fish for dinner. After dragging their longline in circles around it for an hour, they gave up, empty-handed. Docking instead at a nearby island, the officers bought some chicken stew from the local market.I wanted a better view, but as I started to climb onto an upper deck, one of the Indonesian crewmen lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. My hand was inches away from touching an electrified steel cable that the fishermen use to stun catch that flop wildly when first pulled on deck. The crewman pointed to a six-inch black burn mark on a shipmate\u2019s arm, warning me of what the cable could do.As the officers questioned the ship\u2019s captain, I wandered to the back of the ship. A ladder down a hatch led to a four-foot high tunnel, where crawling on hands and knees was the only option. Running the length of the vessel, the tunnel was lined with a dozen six-foot-long cubbies, each with wadded-up clothing at one end serving as pillows. The trip from Taiwan to these waters (about 1,400 miles) takes a little over a week. In high seas and heavy weather, staying on deck is out of the question. The farther I crawled, the darker and muggier it got and the heavier the flow of fumes, heat and noise. A rat scurried ahead. A rancid-smelling liquid dripped from above. The captain later told me that this was runoff from the upper-deck cutting tables.At the deepest end of the tunnel, I came to the ship\u2019s huge diesel engine, churning furiously. I sat in that tight space for a couple of minutes to take in the scene. It dawned on me that the passageway I had just descended was not just the men\u2019s sleeping quarters. It was also the engine\u2019s main exhaust pipe.Back on the Remeliik, I passed the time reading a confidential investigation report about the 2012 Cessna incident, which had been leaked to me by a Palauan official. It in\u00ad\u00adcluded transcripts of interviews with the 25 fishermen from the illegal Chinese boats, who had been arrested and held in the Koror jail for 17 days. Most of the men had never been to sea before, nor did they know the name of their ship, the fishing company or even their captain. Most had handed their identity cards over to the fishing company, which had hired them only several months earlier. Many claimed that they fled that day because they thought the Palauans, who were not in uniform, were planning to rob them. \u2018\u2018He claims that he does not know about any fishing permits,\u2019\u2019 a police investigator said of one deckhand. \u2018\u2018They only follow what the captain tells them.\u2019\u2019The crew members pleaded guilty and were fined $1,000 each. Their small fast boat was destroyed, their gear confiscated. They were then flown home, with their slain colleague, Yong Lu, in a coffin, on a charter flight sent by the Chinese government. One line in the investigation report struck me. It said that in several days of poaching, the Chinese crew caught fewer than a dozen fish, primarily lapu lapu, and several large clams, most of which they later threw overboard as they fled the authorities. It seemed a tragically small yield.In the wheel room of the Remeliik that night, the officers did a post mortem about the day\u2019s boarding, and the discussion turned to the crews that work on these poacher ships. \u2018\u2018Aren\u2019t they the enemy?\u2019\u2019 I asked. Several officers shook their heads to say no. Once the authorities take the foreign crews to shore, there is no guarantee that Palau will have the translators to communicate with them, jail space to hold them or even the laws to effectively prosecute them. Many of the poachers they arrest are from family-owned businesses and are unable to pay the $500,000 fine Palau has the option to levy. The government can seize the ship, but the cost to feed, house and repatriate the crew is often more than its resale value.Near the end of our patrol, Baiei asked me if I had ever seen a diver with the bends. I said I hadn\u2019t. He explained that many of the poachers they chase are Vietnamese, young divers who target sea cucumbers, which live on the ocean floor and look like giant, leather-skinned slugs. The Vietnamese crewmen hold rubber hoses in their mouths attached to an onboard air compressor, strap lead weights around their waists, then dive, often deeper than a hundred feet. During an arrest last year, Baiei said, one of these divers shot to the surface too quickly, causing excruciating bubbles to form in his joints and elsewhere. They took him to a hospital to recover. \u2018\u2018He just kept moaning for days,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said.One of the other officers, who had been listening to the conversation quietly, looked up from his inspection logs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the real bycatch,\u2019\u2019 he said. For Palau\u2019s police, the catch \u2014 the far more elusive target \u2014 was the fishing companies who send these desperate men to sea to flout the law. But in a sense, even those bosses are bycatch, too, in a worldwide fishing economy where sanctioned corporations, far more than poachers, are stripping the oceans of life. To save Palau\u2019s fish, and the world\u2019s, the law and its enforcers need to bring an entire industrial system to heel: a mission that requires a level of international cooperation and political will that has yet to materialize.An article on Feb. 21 about the efforts taken by Palau to stop illegal fishing in its waters referred incorrectly to the percentage of illegally caught fish that is consumed. One in every five fish consumed globally \u2014 not in the United States \u2014 is caught illegally.Ian Urbina is an investigative reporter who has been on the staff at The New York Times since 2003.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Shortcuts in Evaluating Your Investment Risk", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byEarly in my career, I worked for a big brokerage firm. Back then, I made a habit of seeking out the veteran stockbrokers and quizzing them about their careers. One day, I had a pretty extensive conversation about risk with one of those grizzled Wall Street guys.I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201cLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re moving into a high-rise condominium in Florida, and there\u2019re only two units for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is the penthouse \u2014 beautiful view, amazing balcony, but it\u2019s 37 floors up. The other is a garden-level walkout unit. Not the same view, but on the first floor, and your door exits right onto the street.\u201dHe continued, \u201cYou want to know the risk tolerance of your clients? Just ask them which one they\u2019d choose. If they choose the penthouse, they can handle a lot of risk. If they choose the garden unit, they\u2019re very conservative investors.\u201dIt\u2019s a really great story, and I\u2019ll always remember it. But it\u2019s also total garbage.There are many stories like this one, basically shortcuts that people try to use to determine how much risk they can handle with their investments. Maybe you\u2019ve heard the one where your hobbies determine the risk you\u2019re comfortable taking? If you\u2019re a private pilot or a rock climber, the legend goes, then surely you can handle lots of investment risk.This year\u2019s scary markets have led to lots of talk about how you should go about deciding how much risk to take. The way this decision manifests itself is through the percentage of your money you decide to have in the stock market.Unfortunately, you can\u2019t just push a button and get an easy answer to the \u201chow much risk\u201d question. But that doesn\u2019t keep people from trying. If you\u2019ve been to one of the major brokerage firms in the last 20 years, you may have completed what\u2019s called a risk tolerance questionnaire. You get a series of 10 to 20 questions intended to figure out how much risk you can handle, like:I would consider selling my investment if it\u2019s down:a) 20 percentb) 30 percentc) 40 percentd) 50 percent or greater.In theory, based on your answer, you should know how you\u2019ll react during a scary market.Many in the industry use these questionnaires as a shortcut to plug investors into a prepackaged blend of mutual funds without really considering the specifics of annoying, messy things like values and goals. In other words, it\u2019s a lazy way of making a basic diagnosis and then writing you a prescription.The questionnaire is seen as a way for advisers to cover themselves in case risk appears (the market is down) and clients don\u2019t like it. Advisers can point to the questionnaire and claim they were just giving the client what they wanted.Traditionally, the problem with these tools has been that if you answer these questions during a bull market, you tend to answer, \u201cRisk? No problem, bring it on!\u201d But if you were to answer the same questions during a really scary market, you\u2019re more likely to say, \u201cRisk? Yikes, get me out of here!\u201dIf you or your adviser is not careful to examine the last few times you felt elated or scared about your financial life, you could be in danger of doing the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time. Remember, our natural temptation is always to buy high and sell low \u2014 to be greedy when everyone else is greedy and scared when everyone else is scared. And that\u2019s the exact opposite of what Warren Buffett suggests we do.These tools may sound intelligent. There may even be really intelligent people administering them. But the truth is, they are just a more sophisticated version of the condominium example.Let me be clear: I don\u2019t think questionnaires are completely useless. In the hands of a thoughtful adviser, they provide a starting point for useful conversations. But the way they are often used in the industry, as a push-button answer to how much risk you should take, is just plain wrong.You may find that you only need to have 20 percent of your assets in stocks to get the return you need to reach your goals. You may find you need 80 percent. Whatever you discover, if reaching your goals requires more risk than you\u2019re comfortable taking, the next logical step is to reassess your goals. Have some real, serious conversations about what trade-offs you\u2019re willing to accept.Now that we\u2019ve been reacquainted with scary markets, use what you\u2019ve learned to get clear about what you can handle in terms of risk. Sure, put yourself through one of the risk tolerance questionnaires, but also make sure you go through the process of building a plan. Figure out what you need in the stock market to meet your goals. Finally, have an honest conversation with yourself about whether you can handle the risk. And if you can\u2019t, then go back to the drawing board and try again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economic Picture Turns Uglier, Beijing Applies Airbrush", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 This month, Chinese banking officials omitted currency data from closely watched economic reports.Weeks earlier, Chinese regulators fined a journalist $23,000 for reposting a message that said a big securities firm had told elite clients to sell stock.Before that, officials pressed two companies to stop releasing early results from a survey of Chinese factories that often moved markets.The effort to control the economic narrative plays into a wide-reaching strategy by President Xi Jinping to solidify support at a time when doubts are swirling about his ability to manage the tumult. The persistence of that tumult was underscored on Thursday by a 6.4 percent drop in Chinese stocks, which are now down more than a fifth since the beginning of this year alone.But the tightly scripted story makes it ever more difficult to get information needed to gauge the extent of the country\u2019s slowdown, analysts say. \u201cData disappears when it becomes negative,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, which analyzes the Chinese economy.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The party\u2019s attitude has raised further questions among executives and economists over whether Chinese policy makers know how to manage a quasi-market economy, the second-largest economy in the world, after that of the United States.Economists have long cast some doubt on Chinese official figures, which show a huge economy that somehow manages to avoid the peaks and valleys that other countries regularly report. In recent years, China made efforts to improve that data by releasing more information more frequently, among other measures. It also gave its financial media greater freedom, even as censors kept a tight leash on political discourse.\u201cMany economic indicators are on a downward trend in China, and economic data has become quite sensitive nowadays,\u201d said Yuan Gangming, a researcher at the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.The restrictions illustrate the Chinese government\u2019s competing priorities, said Leland R. Miller, president of China Beige Book International, which surveys Chinese companies. \u201cThe environment is getting tougher and tougher to operate in,\u201d he said, though he added that his company had not been told to rein in its activities.\u201cWe are going to continue to see crackdowns on people telling a different story than what Beijing wants to hear,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAt the same time, Beijing appears to be conflicted on this issue, because it recognizes that without independent gauges, commercial relations and foreign direct investment will suffer, due to growing skepticism over official data.\u201dA spokeswoman for Markit declined to comment, while Caixin representatives did not respond to a request for comment.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.\u201cIt\u2019s a very influential economic indicator, and it\u2019s highly cited overseas,\u201d said Mr. Yuan, the researcher at Tsinghua. \u201cGiven the international worry over the Chinese economy, I had a sense last August that the Caixin indicator wouldn\u2019t really last long, because its publishing in mainland China had touched high-tension lines.\u201dBoth sets of numbers, which show commercial banks\u2019 foreign exchange purchase positions, appeared last year in the central bank\u2019s monthly announcements. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, did not answer a request for comment.The National Bureau of Statistics did not return requests seeking comment.Ms. Stevenson-Yang, of J Capital Research, said she and her colleagues had seen growing discrepancies in official data in the last two years in a variety of sectors, including retail, shipping and steel production. She said a colleague had once called a Chinese cement factory to ask for production data, and a factory employee had thought the researcher was calling from a government-affiliated research association. The employee told the researcher that the factory had already changed its numbers twice and would rather not do it again, so the researcher could choose any number that fit.\u201cWhen you go around and meet state-owned industry people, everybody laughs at the national statistics, so I don\u2019t know why foreigners believe them,\u201d Ms. Stevenson-Yang said.Capital Economics, a London research firm, said in a recent report that problems with China\u2019s statistical system \u201cgo beyond those found in an emerging economy. The biggest is that the G.D.P. growth rate is politically sensitive, which makes it more likely to suffer manipulation.\u201d The firm does its own growth-rate estimate for China\u2019s gross domestic product, which it put at 4.3 percent last year.China\u2019s online monitors have intensified their policing of chatter about markets. \u201cThe People\u2019s Bank has gone crazy,\u201d read one recent post that was later deleted, referring to the central bank. Another deleted post said: \u201cOne mistake after another. All assets are gone.\u201dLast June, Liu Qintao, a journalist for a newspaper in Shandong Province, posted in an online forum a message he had seen about Dongguan Securities, a Chinese brokerage firm. The post said Dongguan Securities had warned \u201cV.I.P. investors\u201d about coming risks and had urged them to sell.The next day, Dongguan Securities said none of its employees had issued the warning. Chinese stock markets began crashing two weeks later.On Jan. 8, more than six months after he posted the message, officials fined Mr. Liu $23,000 on a charge of having spread fabricated information. Mr. Liu said in an interview that he was being made a scapegoat and was appealing the fine.\u201cI didn\u2019t fabricate the message,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would I do that? Who would make up things like that? All I did was copy and paste it.\u201dThe China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to a request for comment.Last summer, Mr. Carnes said, China started to make it more difficult to gain access to online information about companies. \u201cIn general, over time, the trend has been positive and improving, but since last summer, we did see another step backward,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic and feel over all that the long-term trend is still improving,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is an unfortunate setback.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Private Equity Leaders Expect to Become Buyers in 2016", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported bySuperReturn InternationalBERLIN \u2014 Oh, what a difference a few years make.In 2013, Leon D. Black, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management, famously said that the company was \u201cselling everything that not\u2019s nailed down.\u201dThat came near the height of a period of selling when private equity firms returned hundreds of billions of dollars in capital to investors and exited investments, including dozens of public listings of portfolio companies in London and the United States.But a global upheaval in markets in recent months, driven in part by a drop in energy prices and a slowdown in China\u2019s economy, has brought the initial public offering market to a halt in the United States and begun to weigh on the valuations of companies both private and public.That is creating an opportunity for private equity firms to become buyers once again, industry leaders said at the SuperReturn International conference in Berlin on Tuesday.\u201cThe macro today is just terrible if you\u2019re a seller,\u201d Donald J. Gogel, the chairman and chief executive of Clayton Dubilier & Rice, said during a panel discussion on Tuesday. \u201cBut as private equity investors, we\u2019re both buyers and sellers. We\u2019ve just come off of five extraordinary years last year in terms of where the private equity industry returned some $900 billion of proceeds back to investors. It\u2019s very churlish to complain about exits constrained in 2016.\u201d\u201cThe flip side of all of this turmoil is that we can put our buyers hats on again and go back to doing what I think our investors expect us to do: to find good values in the most turbulent of times,\u201d he added.Steve Koltes, the co-founder of CVC Capital Partners, said valuations of potential private equity targets remain high, in part because of the low cost of capital.But he said he would expect the decline in valuations of publicly traded companies in recent months to trickle into the private market.Mr. Koltes said that CVC had sold 6 billion euros, or about $6.6 billion, in public stocks from its portfolio last year through I.P.O.s and block trades. He said the turmoil in the markets in recent months had reduced the valuation of those companies by \u20ac1.5 billion since CVC\u2019s exit.\u201cWhen I look at those stocks that are now worth four-and-a-half billion, I say those are pretty good values,\u201d Mr. Koltes said.William E. Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, said there was a \u201creal turning of the tide\u201d in terms of the investment environment, with a significant valuation reset in the public markets.\u201cThat\u2019s likely to follow through to the private markets,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the early stages of the private market revaluation. It will take on the order of six to 12 months to really take hold.\u201dAs for Mr. Black, he said Apollo\u2019s teams were reviewing three or four memos a week related to the debt of \u201cvery good, franchise companies\u201d were the pricing has come down substantially in recent months and can provide attractive returns.\u201cThat is a very attractive risk-reward opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot more of them coming.\u201dHe also noted that Apollo had put about a third of the capital in its latest fund \u2013 about $18 billion \u2013 to work up until about a month ago.If the deals are completed, Apollo will have put about half of the capital in its latest fund to work, Mr. Black said.\u201cI think there are opportunities on a selective basis on the equity side,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, increasingly over this next year, there will be more opportunities on the debt side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s Hybrid Bonds Are in a Death Spiral", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDeutsche Bank is turning hybrid bonds from a financial regulation poster boy into a problem child.The German lender moved on Monday to reassure investors worried about delayed coupons on its new AT1 securities. It should not be a big deal if Deutsche Bank suspends payment on its hybrid bonds. It suspended payment of ordinary share dividends last fall for two years, and the new \u201cadditional Tier 1\u201d hybrids are supposed to absorb loss while the bank is viable. That\u2019s why they differ from hybrid forebears in 2008. Yet instead of damping volatility, the fear of a trigger is making it worse.Bank stocks have been falling over growth fears. That eventually started to catch up with additional Tier 1 securities. Deutsche\u2019s are particularly vulnerable because of the bank\u2019s weak profitability, relatively low capital and uncertainty over German AT1 accounting idiosyncrasies.Consider Deutsche\u2019s 6 percent perpetual bonds. In early January, these yielded around 7 percent, on an expected maturity in 2022. Yet as equity prices fell, investors started to discount AT1s with equitylike yields, pushing down prices. As yields rose, the chances that Deutsche might not call the bond in 2022 increased, thus extending the possible maturity and magnifying losses. Finally, renewed threat of coupon termination meant the risk of a smaller near-term cash flow. What looked like a short-dated bond risked becoming a long-dated, zero coupon instrument. The price fell to 72 percent of par on Monday, from 93 percent at the start of the year.The problem for regulators and investors alike is that all this creates a feedback loop. As AT1 prices fell, investors had few places to sell. Banks do not like making markets in the distressed debt of their peers, and Asian private banks \u2013 big buyers of high-yield securities \u2013 were on holiday on Monday. So investors sold credit default swaps. That pushed Deutsche\u2019s senior credit default swaps to over 270 basis points, a level not seen since the eurozone financial crisis. Yet the risk of Deutsche failing is barely comparable: Its 53 billion euros of tangible book value is 40 percent higher than the 2011 figure.The AT1 death spiral is only one small factor in the current market maelstrom. But it highlights the risks of dressing up equity as debt. Regulators hoped the new hybrids would be better at absorbing losses than the precrisis ones. The instruments are great at absorbing losses, but the market is not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Economic Stupidity", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byYet economic risks have by no means been banished from the world. And you should be frightened by how little many of the people who would be president have learned from the past eight years.If you\u2019ve been following the financial news, you know that there\u2019s a lot of market turmoil out there. It\u2019s nothing like 2008, at least so far, but it\u2019s worrisome.Once again we have a substantial amount of troubled debt, this time not home mortgages but loans to energy companies, hit hard by plunging oil prices. Meanwhile, formerly trendy emerging economies like Brazil are suddenly doing very badly, and China is stumbling. And while the U.S. economy is doing better than almost anyone else\u2019s, we\u2019re definitely not immune to contagion.It looks, in other words, as if we\u2019re still living in the economic era we entered in 2008 \u2014 an era of persistent weakness, in which deflation and depression, not inflation and deficits, are the key challenges. So how well do we think the various presidential wannabes would deal with those challenges?Well, on the Republican side, the answer is basically, God help us. Economic views on that side of the aisle range from fairly crazy to utterly crazy.On the Democratic side, both contenders talk sensibly about macroeconomic policy, with Mr. Sanders rightly declaring that the recent rate hike was a bad move. But Mr. Sanders has also attacked the Federal Reserve in a way Mrs. Clinton has not \u2014 and that difference illustrates in miniature both the reasons for his appeal and the reasons to be very worried about his approach.Now, the idea of making the Fed accountable sounds good. But Wall Street isn\u2019t the only source of malign pressure on the Fed, and in the actually existing U.S. political situation, such a bill would essentially empower the cranks \u2014 the gold-standard-loving, hyperinflation-is-coming types who dominate the modern G.O.P., and have spent the past five or six years trying to bully monetary policy makers into ceasing and desisting from their efforts to prevent economic disaster. Given the economic risks we face, it\u2019s a very good thing that Mr. Sanders\u2019s support wasn\u2019t enough to push the bill over the top.But even without Mr. Paul\u2019s bill, one shudders to think about how U.S. policy would respond to another downturn if any of the surviving Republican candidates make it to the Oval Office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Global Banking Hub Is Mostly Leery of an E.U. Exit", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 With a referendum looming on whether Britain will leave the European Union, the country\u2019s voters seem sharply divided on whether to stay or go.But for the big banks that dominate the City, as London\u2019s financial industry is known, there is little disagreement: They don\u2019t want to risk going it alone.\u201cLondon is a global center; it\u2019s also a European center \u2014 one is contingent on the other,\u201d said Alan Houmann, managing director of European government affairs for Citigroup. \u201cFinancial institutions come into London from third countries, like the U.S. and from the rest of the E.U., so this creates this huge ecosystem at which London sits at the center.\u201dPrime Minister David Cameron, who wants his country to remain in the bloc, is negotiating changes to the country\u2019s terms of membership ahead of a summit meeting with European leaders on Feb. 18 and 19. (The referendum in Britain could come as soon as June.) With his counterparts in Europe, Mr. Cameron is trying to secure Britain\u2019s status in the financial hierarchy by seeking assurances that banks and other firms will not be discriminated against as the eurozone becomes more integrated.He is navigating a political minefield. As much as Germany and France want Britain to stay part of a club that has helped reinforce peace and regional stability for decades, other members worry about the precedent of granting any one country too many side deals or breaching fundamental principles of unity.And the big banks are hardly a sympathetic cause, making industry executives somewhat more tempered in their comments on a Brexit. The British public blames highly paid bankers for the financial crisis and the scandals over currency trading and interest-rate rigging.Bankers do not exactly love the raft of regulations in Europe, like the cap on bonuses and a proposal to tax financial transactions. But many believe that a Brexit would be problematic.Were Britain to leave the European Union, bankers in London might no longer have the automatic right to provide services to clients in other European nations \u2014 like securities trading, foreign exchange and investment management.Britain would also cede its ability to help shape, block or amend European financial and banking laws. It could be demoted, in the catchphrase of anti-Brexit campaigners, from being a rule maker to a rule taker.\u201cBanks won\u2019t disappear from London overnight, but they will over time if Britain votes \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d to the European Union, Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde, the co-chief executives of Goldman Sachs International, argued in an op-ed article in The Times, the London newspaper.Goldman has been more visible than many big banks on this issue and has donated a six-figure sum to Britain Stronger in Europe, a lobbying campaign that is opposed to a Brexit. Goldman declined to comment on its donations.Even bankers who operate solely within Britain acknowledge the potential disruptions.Secure Trust, a small, domestically focused British bank, has little to gain commercially from the European Union\u2019s single market. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Lynam, is also unhappy with the way European regulators interpret international rules. He notes, for example, that the European Union requires Secure Trust to maintain capital reserves \u2014 cushions against risk \u2014 that he says are larger than necessary for an institution like his that mainly serves consumers and small businesses.Although he believes that a Brexit would be \u201cmade to work,\u201d it would most likely mean years of negotiation over the details of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the bloc. This process, he said, would be \u201cmessy, costly, disruptive and time-consuming.\u201d\u201cWe need to know what are the options being offered to us by way of concessions, relative to the dangers of the leap into the unknown,\u201d Mr. Lynam said.He is also concerned about the backlash among the banks\u2019 customers. Most opinion polls show that the British public is almost evenly split on the Brexit issue.\u201cIf I take a public position I will upset half my customers \u2014 a quarter of a million customers,\u201d said Mr. Lynam. \u201cSo I won\u2019t be in a rush to do that.\u201dStill, some in the City have openly contemplated a Brexit.One is Norman Blackwell, a former adviser to two Conservative prime minsters, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, who is now chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Last year, Mr. Blackwell told the House of Lords \u2014 where he is a member \u2014 that Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc might become \u201cincreasingly unsustainable.\u201d He noted that his comments reflected his personal views.And some hedge fund executives in the City would just as soon quit the European Union. Hedge funds have tended to chafe under the closer oversight that European regulators have demanded since the global financial crisis of 2008.But among the City\u2019s hedge funds, there is no consensus, particularly given that they would still face European rules to court European business.\u201cHedge fund businesses in the U.K. recognize that they would not be able to avoid E.U. regulation if there were a Brexit, since all non-E.U. hedge funds today have to comply with a range of E.U. rules in order to raise capital in the E.U. or trade on the bloc\u2019s capital markets,\u201d said Jack Inglis, chief executive of the London-based Alternative Investment Management Association, a trade group.Even the big international banks that benefit most from the European single market assume they would probably survive a Brexit. Most have operations in the eurozone that could be expanded.Some are already moving some operations from London to reduce costs. Credit Suisse, for example, opened a branch office in Dublin.Seen in that light, a Brexit is not as risky to any specific bank as it is to London\u2019s role as a global financial center.\u201cIf no one moves, then no one moves,\u201d Mr. Houmann of Citi said. \u201cIf everyone moves a bit, then there\u2019s quite a big drop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Stocks Gyrate, It\u2019s Time to Measure Your Risk Tolerance", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyIt\u2019s time you got to know yourself a little better.And the time is now, when the stock market has been mostly falling, the talking heads are raising their voices, and your friends who went to school longer than you did are sending emails asking if you\u2019re selling your investments and putting money under the mattress.Suddenly, they see risk everywhere and feel it acutely. Maybe you do, too. But here\u2019s the problem with listening to them too much: It can make you sick to your stomach with fear. That can lead to hasty financial decisions and stock transactions that you may regret.To combat those feelings, you can conduct a self-evaluation of your risk tolerance. Two companies, FinaMetrica and Riskalyze, have built businesses around these sorts of assessments. While they generally work with financial advisers who put clients through the tests, both have made versions of their tools available to New York Times readers at my request.Try a few of them, or take an hour or so and run through them all. There are few financial tasks more important than acquiring this self-knowledge because too many people don\u2019t know their tolerance well enough and take on too much risk. This can result in getting greedy and buying more investments while stock prices are high and selling when stocks have plunged, thus locking in losses. The result of such moves is too often a portfolio that earns many percentage points less over the years than it may have if you had just left things alone.The first part of the process is determining how much risk is required for you to meet your goals: What annual return will you need on your investments to meet them, given what you think you can save?This is not always easy to sort out. Most people have a bunch of buckets of money for different goals, or they try to at least. So what are you aiming to do, and by when? Buy a first home in five years? Send a child to college in 15 years? Retire in 30? And which of these things is most important? Unless you make or save so much money that you can meet those goals through guaranteed returns on certificates of deposit, you\u2019ll probably need to take some investment risks.The second step is figuring out your risk capacity. Can your plan withstand major events that you may not expect, like a mentally ill adult child who requires expensive treatment, the death of a spouse or your own disability? If there\u2019s a shortfall somewhere, can you grab money from other sources? This is one area where a good financial adviser can help by making highly educated guesses, using historical data and software, about the odds of extreme market events testing your capacity or destroying it altogether.Risk tolerance is the third and final step, and it\u2019s all about feelings and personality. Precisely how does taking financial risks turn your stomach \u2014 or turn you on? Humans aren\u2019t so great at figuring this out for themselves, and financial advisers may overestimate clients\u2019 intestinal fortitude.This is where the tests try to help. The founders of FinaMetrica and Riskalyze are somewhat skeptical of one another\u2019s approaches, as you may expect competitors to be. FinaMetrica asks more questions that range wider. Riskalyze focuses on specific investing situations and whether you might consider (or would feel good about) certain risks based on the possibility of various returns. The company also analyzes portfolios and suggests new ones on behalf of its adviser clients (though not in the test made available to Times readers), something FinaMetrica does not do directly. Both companies ask for email addresses from anyone who samples their tests, and they have no intention of selling the data; Riskalyze will send a follow-up note to see if you want the company to pair you with a financial adviser.Among the advisers whom I communicated with this week that use the tests, the majority seem pretty happy with the results, though they state that a numerical score is only a starting point for conversation, not a mandate for specific categories of investing and behaviors.Even broad labels like moderate or conservative are ones that the Riskalyze crew prefers to avoid. \u201cWe are fighting failed semantics,\u201d Michael McDaniel, a founder, said. \u201cWhat do those terms even mean? They are qualitative and subjective. We are quantifying the semantics.\u201dRiskalyzes\u2019 scores range from 1 to 100. If yours is under 45, you\u2019ll probably sleep best with a portfolio that is mostly bonds, cash and the kinds of stable stocks that hold up well when markets are churning. Over 75, and an account filled with stocks, real estate and commodities probably won\u2019t give you an ulcer. (FinaMetrica\u2019s ranges are in the graphic that accompanies this column.)If you\u2019re part of a couple, it\u2019s crucial that both of you take the same test separately, without comparing notes, and get your own scores. For FinaMetrica, the average score for men is 54, while women are more risk averse at 47. \u201cThat is a reconciliation challenge,\u201d Paul Resnik, a founder, said. \u201cShe is going to live longer and need to take a bit more risk.\u201dHere\u2019s what he would ask about how you dealt with the 2008-9 market collapse: Did you throw up your hands and sell everything; freak out and sell most stocks; experience major insomnia but didn\u2019t make any rash changes to your portfolio; worry some but made no changes; or did you rebalance your portfolio to buy stocks as prices fell while selling the few investments that had held up well, or even engage in some bottom feeding? What you actually did, in his mind, is the best indicator of what you\u2019ll do this time and in the future.He has a point. And it\u2019s a good reminder that even if you think you know yourself and you successfully passed the 2009 exam, you should take a few tests and check up on yourself once again. What has changed in your life that might cause you to make rash decisions now?According to FinaMetrica, about 60 percent of the people who take the test and consult with an adviser find that there is no investment strategy that will allow them to reach all of their goals given their risk tolerance. Because that tolerance is part of your personality, it\u2019s difficult to change it much.But there is no shame in changing a goal or two, especially if many of them were stretch targets to begin with. So you push your target retirement age to 68 or decide you can live on 72 percent of your preretirement income instead of 78. Maybe your child takes on a bit more student loan debt.None of this will ruin anyone\u2019s life. And if it keeps you from living with the droning buzz of anxiety every time there is a market hiccup, you\u2019ll probably be happier for it.Advertisement"}

Icahn and David Einhorn \u2014 disclosed they had sold some of their stakes in the company\u2019s stock over the last three months of 2015.Apple\u2019s debt sale is the second-largest bond offering this year, behind Anheuser-Busch\u2019s $45.8 billion bond issue in January, and more than twice as large as AT&T\u2019s $5.99 billion offering that month, according to Thomson Reuters.Apple habitually uses the debt markets despite having $215.7 billion in cash on its books, largely because 93 percent of that cash is abroad and would incur taxes if it were returned home.Company executives said last month that they planned to be \u201cvery active\u201d in the American and international debt markets this year to pay for Apple\u2019s capital return plan. Apple has completed $153 billion of its $200 billion buyback and dividend program.New investment-grade bond sales were humming along in January until the global markets became anxious about plummeting oil prices and fears of economic weakness. After a $2.9 billion bond by Home Depot issued on Feb. 3, the market for new investment grade corporate bonds all but dried up until Tuesday, Thomson Reuters said.IBM announced a sale of $5 billion in bonds of varying maturities on Tuesday, and Comcast priced its $2.25 billion bond deal.Apple said in a securities filing on Tuesday that it would use the money for general corporate purposes, which could include acquisitions and debt repayment. Part of the offering, which includes fixed-\u2009and floating-rate bonds of varying maturities, is a seven-year green bond raising money to invest in clean technology and other environmentally friendly projects.In a separate securities filing, Mr. Icahn disclosed that he sold seven million shares of Apple over the last three months of 2015,Mr. Icahn has been a vocal investor, urging Apple to buy back its shares and at one point wooing Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, with an invitation to dinner at Mr. Icahn\u2019s apartment. The investor currently has a 0.84 percent stake in the company.David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital and another vocal Apple shareholder, also pared back his position in Apple, nearly halving Greenlight\u2019s 11 million stake by selling 4.9 million shares. The firm now has a 0.11 percent stake in the company.One major hedge fund, however, took the opportunity to buy shares. Tiger Global Management took a new position in Apple, scooping up 10.6 million shares.Shares of Apple fell 4.6 percent over the fourth quarter of the year.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nervousness About Global Banking Giants Intensifies", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byStocks & BondsAn unsettling trend has emerged from the heavy selling that sent global markets tumbling this year: Investors are getting nervous about the world\u2019s biggest banks.The concerns about the banks are clearly reflected in the stock markets, where shares in banking giants are plunging. But there are also ominous signs in markets that investors use to bet on the perceived creditworthiness of large financial firms.A crucial benchmark for the banking sector, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, was down more than 3 percent on Monday and had lost nearly 20 percent of its value this year.There were other signs of nervousness.Investors are again rushing into benchmark government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 1.75 percent on Monday; it yielded 2.27 percent at the end of last year. The price of gold is rising. The Vix, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, rose over 10 percent.But the plunge in bank stocks seemed to stir up the most concern.When investors sell bank shares or bet against the banks in credit markets, it can be a signal that a period of financial turbulence has entered a new, potentially more serious phase. It suggests that banks \u2014 meant to act as the gears of an economy, transmitting credit to firms and households \u2014 are becoming more vulnerable to the market volatility and any underlying economic weaknesses. In sluggish economic times, banks may suffer higher losses on some loans, while the current low interest rates make it hard for lenders to earn robust profits on other loans.Analysts noted that the declines in bank shares had occurred as other traditional indicators of fear flashed more brightly. \u201cThe fear trades are becoming more obvious \u2014 and one of those is dumping financial stocks,\u201d said James W. Paulsen of Wells Capital Management.It was not just bank stocks showing pain.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down by more than 2 percent for much of Monday but, after a late rally, the benchmark closed down 1.42 percent. It has lost over 9 percent of its value this year and is now 13 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year.The Nasdaq index, which contains many technology stocks, declined 1.82 percent. It is now 17.92 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year. A decline of 20 percent or more would put the Nasdaq in a bear market.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.1 percent, at 16,027.05.While many large technology companies have strong profits and sturdy balance sheets, their shares are often highly valued, making them vulnerable when markets sell-off. And some analysts think the fall in technology shares is a sign that the froth is finally coming out of the market, putting it close to a bottom. \u201cThis is reminiscent of the late stages of a correction rather than the early part of one,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. Correction is the Wall Street term for a market decline of 10 percent or more.Still, the recent plight of bank stocks does not bode well.On Monday, shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, plummeted nearly 10 percent in Frankfurt, while those in Standard Chartered, a British bank, fell nearly 6 percent, and stock in Citigroup declined more than 5 percent.Deutsche Bank and a handful of other European banks are contending with their own problems that could explain the depth of their recent declines. Banks issue debt to raise money for their loans and operations. In recent weeks, investors have paid a higher price to buy insurance against a bank defaulting on such debt. The cost of using so-called credit-default swaps to gain protection for five years on Deutsche Bank\u2019s debt has doubled since the start of this year, according to data from Markit.Outside of Europe, though, the moves in bank shares are hardly reassuring.Citigroup\u2019s shares, for instance, are down by more than a fourth so far this year. And its stock trades at nearly half of the bank\u2019s book value, which is a theoretical measure of the value that would be left for shareholders if the bank were liquidated. The discount to book value exists at other large banks and effectively indicates that investors have doubts about the banks\u2019 ability to earn a strong return on their capital.Still, Citigroup made over $17 billion in profits last year, has stable management and, looking at its balance sheet, possesses the financial strength to weather an economic slowdown.There is a good chance that investors have become too pessimistic about the big banks\u2019 prospects, and their stocks could bounce back if the wider funk in the market passes. Most banks, after all, are substantially stronger than they were in 2008. And, since then, the banks have managed to earn profits even as they have dealt with a barrage of government lawsuits as well as economic and financial turbulence in Europe and Asia.Still, the declines in bank shares may not indicate that banks are particularly fragile right now but that investors think they will struggle to earn solid profits in the future, at least in part because of ultralow interest rates around the world.Central banks have kept interest rates low to stimulate demand for loans. But loans with low interest rates are often less profitable for banks. As a result, banks may then lend less, which may then reduce the overall impact of low interest rates on the economy.Monday\u2019s trading illustrated the deep stress in the energy sector. Shares in Chesapeake Energy, a beleaguered oil producer, lost a third of their value on Monday. The trade publication Debtwire reported that Chesapeake had hired restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, leading investors to speculate that Chesapeake was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as the low price of oil weighs on the energy industry.Chesapeake put out a statement late Monday morning that Kirkland & Ellis had been one of its legal advisers since 2010 and was counseling the company in its financial restructuring efforts. But the oil driller took pains to note that it \u201ccurrently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The shift has rattled markets around the world, but Japan is particularly vulnerable because of a jump in the value of the yen. A stronger currency hurts profits at companies like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn much of their income abroad.The yen climbed as high as 110.9 to the dollar Friday before settling back to about 112 in late-afternoon trading. The currency\u2019s value has increased about 10 percent since its most recent low in December.Investors\u2019 embrace of the yen has been little affected by the Bank of Japan\u2019s introducing negative interest rates two weeks ago.

But investors appear to believe that the alternatives are worse.The Nikkei more than doubled between late 2012 and the middle of last year, buoyed by an improving global economy and the loose monetary policy of the central bank. Under Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor appointed in early 2013, the bank has been flooding financial markets with cash by buying large amounts of government bonds. The policy led to a sharp devaluation of the yen, but its weakening effect on the currency appears to be waning.The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, sought to calm the market turbulence on Friday.\u201cThe flight from risk is spreading to financial markets around the world, but the Japanese economy is in very solid shape, so investors\u2019 psychology is too pessimistic,\u201d he told reporters after a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting.He added that \u201cabrupt exchange rate movements are undesirable\u201d \u2014 a phrase often used by the Japanese authorities to signal displeasure with the yen\u2019s direction, which has sometimes been followed by actual financial intervention to reverse its course.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 The mood in the markets may be getting grimmer, but in the booming world of exchange-traded funds, people just want to party.It was an invitation-only party (crabs, cocktails and a D.J. on a moonlit dock) thrown by Jane Street, a secretive E.T.F. trading firm that, after years of minting money in the shadows of Wall Street, is now pitching itself to some of the largest institutional investors in the world.And the message was clear: Jane Street, which barely existed 15 years ago and now trades more than $1 trillion a year, was ready to take on the big boys.Much of what Jane Street, which occupies two floors of an office building at the southern tip of Manhattan, does is not known. That is by design, as the firm deploys specialized trading strategies to capture arbitrage profits by buying and selling (using its own capital) large amounts of E.T.F. shares.It\u2019s a risky business.And in many cases, some of the most popular E.T.F.s track hard-to-trade securities like junk bonds, emerging-market stocks and a variety of derivative products, adding an extra layer of risk.These dangers were brought home last August, when markets were rattled by China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency; some of the largest E.T.F.s sank by 50 percent or more.While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what they can do,\u201d said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. \u201cIf you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it\u2019s fewer and fewer firms.\u201dIt is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion.And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader \u2014 one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm\u2019s capital.In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop.Here is a small sample of Jane Street\u2019s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master\u2019s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master\u2019s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor\u2019s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon).For large asset management firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and Invesco, the business of rolling out one E.T.F. after another has become a major profit center. But in many ways, the real money is being made by the trading firms that specialize in making a market in these securities.For example, Jane Street, which is privately held, has increased its shareholder\u2019s equity, or net worth, to more than $1 billion today from $228 million in 2007.That cash cushion handily surpasses what such established investment banks as Evercore, Moelis and Greenhill have (as of 2014) as well as that at money management firms like Eaton Vance.Moreover, it supports just 450 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business.Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level.Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm\u2019s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading.A star trader for the company, he also oversees its hiring process.Jane Street has acquired a reputation for being perhaps the toughest interview in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.This is in part because the firm hires only a handful of new employees each year. To survive, candidates have to ace brain-twisting math riddles and game theory tests.But as Mr. Lehoczky has said when asked what he is looking for in an E.T.F. trader, the ideal candidate possesses what he calls second-order knowledge \u2014 a form of intellectual humility in which really smart people can accept being wrong and own up to mistakes.In that vein, a prospect might be fed a math problem that cannot be answered, just to gauge reaction to failure.Because Jane Street finds itself competing more with Facebook and Google for talent than with, say, Goldman Sachs, the firm lays on the perks. These include a catered breakfast and lunch, a substantial gym right off the trading floor, generous child care benefits and an in-house speaker series that has featured the likes of Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens and Garry Kasparov.As for compensation, how much Jane Street\u2019s rocket scientists get paid is as closely guarded a secret as its trading formulas. Still, it is apparently quite a bit.\u201cAs a trader, if you do well, you will retire before you turn 30,\u201d said one employee on an industry message board.A number of larger banks, Goldman in particular, have been involved in exchange-traded funds for some time now, but the rest of the Wall Street banks are seeking to recruit their own E.T.F. hotshots.One such trader is Monish Shah, a 31-year-old native of Mumbai, who was hired by the Japanese bank Mizuho to build a trading desk in its New York office.Mr. Shah fits the profile of the up-and-coming E.T.F. trader: He is young, has a master\u2019s degree in quantitative finance at Georgia Tech and is as much a writer of code as he is a trader.On an old-school trading desk of mostly white men in their 50s buying and selling common stock, Mr. Shah stands out.Ensconced at the far end of the firm\u2019s equity desk, his four computer screens flash an array of color-coded execution cues, and he is a frequent target of good-natured trading-room banter, sending up his supersize console, his youth and even his Indian accent.As stocks tumbled yet again on a Friday this month, curses rang out up and down the desk. An E.T.F. that Mr. Shah had been eyeing was down more than 3 percent, and now his color-coded signals were flashing green for buy \u2014 which is what he did, just as the market bell rang at 4 p.m.Within a half-hour, the desk was empty as his colleagues rushed to catch the early train home. But Mr. Shah was not going anywhere; he had a business to build.\u201cThere are so many moving parts; if just one thing goes wrong, you get killed,\u201d Mr. Shah said, letting out a slow sigh. \u201cSo yes, it is stressful \u2014 but it is also my passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlyle Group Reports Drop in Profit and Announces Stock Buyback", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byThe Carlyle Group on Wednesday announced its first stock buyback as it tries to counter the perception, heightened by turbulent markets, that the boom in private equity is over.The gain amounted to 24 cents a share, lower than the 31 cents a share expected in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.\u201cCarlyle had a strong 2015 amid challenging markets,\u201d said David M. Rubenstein, the co-chief executive of Carlyle. The firm will buy back $200 million of Carlyle shares, he added, because despite Carlyle\u2019s history of strong performance, \u201cthe equity market currently ascribes little value to our diversified investment platform.\u201dBoth Apollo and Fortress told investors last week that they would buy back shares \u2014 Apollo $250 million worth and Fortress $100 million. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company kicked of the trend when it pledged to buy back as much as $500 million worth of shares last October.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.With the price of oil down sharply and global markets flailing, the rich performance fees that Carlyle receives on its investments have slowed. Those fees are driven in part by the buyout firm\u2019s exit of these investments by listing them in the public markets\u2014 which have been fewer in number.In the final quarter of the year, Carlyle said it made $4 billion on proceeds from sales of 140 investments in portfolio companies. Over 2015, Carlyle made $18 billion compared with $19.7 billion in 2014. It also said it raised $2.7 billion from investors in the last three months of the year, raising the total amount raised over the year to $16.4 billion.For Carlyle, distributable earnings, or the cash generated and eligible to be passed along to shareholders, was $145 million in the fourth quarter, down 53 percent from $311 million last year.One of the biggest disappointments for Carlyle has been its investment in the hedge fund Claren Road, which is part of its global market strategies business. Assets under management at the hedge fund fell to less than $2 billion at the end of last year from $8 billion at its peak in 2014. Carlyle bought a majority stake in the hedge fund, founded by four Citigroup traders, in 2010 as part of a move to diversify beyond its core business of buyouts.But there other bright spots in the unit. The firm is raising money for a second energy mezzanine fund, with $2.7 billion already committed, which recently began collecting fees. Carlyle is also planning to raise money for a new distressed fund that will focus on turnaround deals and credit opportunities.Carlyle\u2019s real estate assets gained 27 percent over the year, while its core buyout funds gained 13 percent. Executives have been quick to point out that while this rate of appreciation has slowed for its cornerstone buyout business, it still outperformed the 1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the same period.Striking a more positive note for 2016, Carlyle\u2019s co-founder, William E. Conway, said that the firm already had $4 billion of deals that in the pipeline and roughly the same amount in companies that it was contracted to sell.\u201cWe expect a tougher environment over the next few years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is in this environment we\u2019ll expect to see the best opportunities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Bond Yield Slides Below Zero and Stocks Fall", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Given Japan\u2019s outsize public debt, holding an i.o.u. from its government might seem like a risky proposition that would require the promise of a substantial reward.But this week, as global economic fears drove money into safer assets, investors in Japanese debt began essentially performing that service for free.On Tuesday, the yield on Japanese 10-year bonds, the benchmark of government borrowing, dropped to zero for the first time. They quickly fell into negative territory, meaning some investors were buying bonds despite knowing that if they held them until maturity, they would come away with less money than they paid.And on top of that, a strong yen dragged Japanese stocks down more than 5 percent in the worst trading day this year. The market opened lower again on Wednesday.The move was intended to bolster the Japanese economy, but the flight by global investors to perceived safe assets is complicating the effort.Like savers depositing money at a local bank, banks keep their own unused cash at the central bank. The interest they earn on those reserves \u2014 or do not earn, as the case may be \u2014 helps determine the cost of other kinds of borrowing and lending.The Bank of Japan\u2019s new policy is intended to stimulate the economy, which narrowly avoided falling into recession last quarter. By making it unprofitable for banks to hold cash, Mr. Kuroda hopes to encourage them to lend more freely and get businesses and households to spend. He also wants to give a lift to consumer prices, which have been sagging after a welcome but short-lived bout of inflation.In other countries that have introduced negative interest rates, like Sweden and Switzerland, government bond yields have also been pushed below zero.Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said that the reversal in bond yields was bound to happen eventually, given the negative interest rate policy, but it occurred more quickly than many expected. The imposition of negative rates on bank reserves will not even take effect until next week.The speed, he said, was because of a factor that is complicating Mr. Kuroda\u2019s stimulus program: a rush by global investors to buy the yen, which is seen as a safe currency at a time of economic uncertainty. The resulting rise in the yen\u2019s exchange rate has hurt the Japanese stock market and darkened the outlook for inflation, canceling out much of the efforts of the Bank of Japan, or B.O.J.\u201cThe China slowdown, falling oil prices, fears about a U.S. recession \u2014 the headwinds facing the B.O.J. are very strong,\u201d Mr. Adachi said.One goal of negative interest rates is to redirect investors\u2019 money from bonds into more theoretically productive assets like property and stocks. But in at least one sector, finance, the policy has deepened the equities rout. Banks are reluctant to pass the costs of negative rates on to depositors, for fear they will pull their money out of their accounts en masse. Instead, the banks are absorbing the penalties themselves, cutting into profits.This week the yen has strengthened to a little over 114 to the dollar, about 10 percent stronger than its most recent low. That is bad news for the many Japanese companies that earn revenues outside Japan: the stronger the yen, the less their foreign-currency earnings contribute to profits.The Nikkei 225-stock average dropped 5.4 percent Tuesday, its biggest one-day drop since May 2013, as investors reacted to the potential blow to corporate earnings. It was down a further 0.7 percent in early trading Wednesday morning.Easy money from the central bank had kept the yen relatively weak since 2013, but a reversal appears to be gathering pace despite the central bank\u2019s latest move.Japan\u2019s status as a haven for investors can seem puzzling. It is carrying the heaviest government debt load in the world, at the equivalent of about two and a half years\u2019 economic output. But most experts are sanguine about the risks. The debt is still amply funded by local savings. And taking the private sector into account, Japan as a whole is a major net creditor, not a borrower. That greatly reduces the risk of instability.For now, the bigger danger appears to be that efforts to get its economy growing again will stall. Stimulus by the Bank of Japan has played an outsize role in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic policy, known as Abenomics. One concern for government and central bank officials is that companies will resist demands to increase workers\u2019 pay as the stronger yen eats into profits. That would block what the bank and many economists see as a crucial means of promoting spending and inflation.\u201cCorporate management now has many excuses for not raising wages,\u201d Mr. Adachi said. He added that the Bank of Japan would likely impose even steeper negative rates, something Mr. Kuroda hinted was possible in a policy speech last week.\u201cOne purpose of the B.O.J.\u2019s move was to dispel the idea that it lacks ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cKuroda will continue to try and surprise the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s 3 Mandates: Price Stability, Jobs and ... Wall Street?", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSuppose a visitor from the future comes and tells you these facts about the financial markets in the year 2030: The stock market has fallen sharply, as have the price of oil and investors\u2019 expectations for interest rate increases over the next couple of years.You would probably assume that the economy was heading down the tubes and in real trouble, quite possibly moving toward a recession.A different visitor from the future arrives and tells you of this state of the world in 2035: The jobless rate is below 5 percent, and employers are hiring at a rapid clip and giving workers their biggest raises in years. Service industries that account for a large percentage of the economy are growing nicely, and consumers are spending money at a steady pace. Everything is just fine.You\u2019ve surely already guessed that both these descriptions apply to the United States in 2016, with big implications for businesses of all stripes and for the presidential election. But the tension \u2014 between a miserable few months in the financial markets and generally solid economic data \u2014 also exposes one of the thorniest questions with which policy makers at the Federal Reserve must grapple.If it\u2019s market data, then Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, and her colleagues should forestall any further interest rate increases indefinitely and perhaps reverse their quarter-point increase in December and entertain instead more radical easing measures. If it\u2019s economic data, they should feel comfortable proceeding with pushing interest rates higher.But beneath that question lies an even harder one. Can Ms. Yellen wean the economy off what is often called \u201cthe Greenspan put?\u201d And should she?The Greenspan put is the idea \u2014 much disputed within the halls of the Fed, but taken for granted in much of the financial world \u2014 that the central bank will forever stand willing to intervene to keep markets from falling too much. Greenspan is, of course, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and a put is an options contract that insures against decline.Perhaps most famously, in October 1987, the morning after the stock market crashed, the Fed offered this one-sentence statement: \u201cThe Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation\u2019s central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\u201dIt did the trick. The market stabilized, and the United States economy kept growing for four more years. Eleven years later, when a crisis in emerging markets seemed to threaten the booming American economy, the Fed cut interest rates three times, successfully containing the damage. When the dot-com bubble was collapsing in 2001, it did the same, less successfully.In each case, Fed officials argued that they were not focused on trying to prop up the market for its own sake, but were trying to keep the economy on an even keel despite market turmoil. When the stock market drops, Americans are less wealthy and so would be expected to spend less money, and capital is more expensive for businesses, which would tend to make them less inclined to invest.While headlines tend to focus on the stock market during periods of turmoil, these episodes usually involve a lot more happening in the financial world beneath the surface, like the interest rates on riskier bonds spiking relative to those of safer bonds, and the drying up of credit availability. In effect, the Fed cut rates in these episodes not to try to bail out investors in the stock market, but to offset these effects for ordinary consumers and businesses.That\u2019s the line you\u2019ll hear from Fed officials, anyway. The challenge is that, in practice, this behavior looks an awful lot like the Fed stepping in to bail out the stock market \u2014 so much so that financial markets tend to price in lower future interest rates whenever there is a drop in the stock market, as has happened in the early weeks of 2016.The Fed started the year with signals that it would most likely raise its short-term interest rate target four times in 2016. After an approximately 10 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 but steady economic data \u2014 futures markets now suggest only one rate rise is the most likely outcome. In other words, markets seem to believe that the Greenspan put has become the Yellen put.And to the degree that the Greenspan put is real, and continues, it raises difficult questions.It might seem great to keep markets from falling too much, but that can create complacency and just encourage investors to take greater risk \u2014 creating much more damage when the bubble ultimately pops. This arguably is part of what happened in the 2008 financial crisis: that years of Greenspanian work to keep markets from plummeting had made the entire financial system brittle and overleveraged.There\u2019s a simpler moral case against central banks propping up falling markets, which is that it implies a government entity using public resources to keep a predominantly wealthy investor class from losing money. The interests of Wall Street and Main Street don\u2019t always align.There are some hints that the Yellen Fed is reluctant to react to the latest palpitations in markets. On Tuesday, the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, noted that there had been episodes in which markets tumbled but no broader slump ensued.The challenge, as Mr. Fischer suggested, is to decide which type of market move this really is.Is it more like mid-2007, when turmoil in financial markets was the early warning of a recession that wouldn\u2019t begin until the end of that year? Or is it more like 1998, when the Fed cut rates in response to market turmoil that never caused economic ripples on United States shores?He and Ms. Yellen will show their conclusions through their actions \u2014 and in the process send a signal to Wall Street about whether, a decade after Mr. Greenspan left office, his approach to the job persists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
