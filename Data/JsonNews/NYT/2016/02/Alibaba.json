{"Headline": "Yahoo Again Considers Selling Itself as Investor Pressure Rises", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is game on once more for a potential Yahoo deal \u2014 maybe.In acknowledging that it is exploring \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d which is Wall Street\u2019s favorite way to say \u201cputting itself up for sale,\u201d Yahoo finds itself in a familiar place. In 2008, Microsoft tried and failed to buy the web company.Three years after that effort, as activist investors like Daniel S. Loeb hovered, speculation ran wild that the company might get sold. Then competing groups of investors prepared for the chance to buy a minority stake in Yahoo \u2014 only to see that opportunity disappear.Now it is 2016, and Yahoo is reluctantly weighing a sale of its core Internet operations as hedge fund activists like Starboard Value once more criticize the company\u2019s management.It is clear that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, would prefer her own self-help plan of cutting costs, businesses and employees. Both Ms. Mayer and people close to the company have said that the current focus on a so-called reverse spin, where it would spin off into a separately traded company Yahoo\u2019s core business along with its stake in its Japanese affiliate, makes the most sense.But pressure from Starboard and others have finally forced Yahoo into weighing alternatives in the name of getting the most for long-suffering shareholders. In the company\u2019s words, it is leaving no stone unturned.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The company\u2019s announcement on Tuesday sought to make clear that it would consider \u201cqualified strategic proposals\u201d \u2014 language aimed at preserving whatever negotiating leverage it can with potential suitors. That may be difficult, given how stagnant its stock has been over the past decade.Public market investors still assign no value to Yahoo\u2019s core Internet operations. The company\u2019s stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, alone comes to about $26 billion, or virtually all of Yahoo\u2019s current market value.But clearly what remains \u2014 including Yahoo\u2019s mail, sports, finance and search operations \u2014 has some value, a point that both management and investors agitating for a sale have argued. The company says that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its core units should amount to $1 billion.Verizon Communications, often mentioned as a likely suitor for Yahoo, valued AOL, a similarly stagnant business, at roughly 7.5 times Ebitda in its $4.4 billion takeover of the onetime Internet giant last year. Analysts and investors have speculated that putting AOL and Yahoo together, a combination dreamed of for some time, could yield advertising efficiencies that could compel Verizon to pay up for Yahoo.Both corporate suitors and private equity firms have expressed interest in a potential deal, as varied as Verizon, TPG Capital or Bain Capital, according to people briefed on the matter.But it is early days yet, with several potential buyers cautioning that their plans are in the preliminary stage. The slowdown in the debt markets may put a dent in the ability of private equity firms\u2019 ability to buy Yahoo, though bankers said that the company\u2019s relatively steady revenues would support the financing required in a leveraged buyout.Yahoo may yet forgo a sale, at least if it had its way. It certainly has the experience in doing so. The trick now will be in convincing shareholders that sticking to its plans will pay off in a way that an outright sale will not \u2014 an argument that may be harder to make with irate investors prepared to wage battle once more.Advertisement"}

That is a shift from the company\u2019s position as recently as December.\u201cWhat I am trying to do is reassure people,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in an interview. \u201cYou could classify it as a call for patience. I am asking shareholders to understand this is a complicated situation.\u201dIn a conference call with analysts, she added: \u201cIt is going to be very busy.\u201dVery busy, and very riveting. Whether the intense, glamorous and controversial executive will get more time to fix the company promises to be one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent dramas of 2016. The next move is up to activist investors, who can try to elect a new slate to the Yahoo board.Whether it is sold or survives, Yahoo is getting smaller. It said on Tuesday it would lay off about 15 percent of its 11,000 employees. By the end of the cuts, the company said its work force would be about 42 percent smaller than it was in 2012.In addition to being smaller, Ms. Mayer said, the company would be simpler. Yahoo will shed assets, cut expenses and focus on the areas of the company that are growing. When she arrived at Yahoo after working as an executive at Google, she said, \u201cWe were sitting on $5 billion in deteriorating revenue with no clear path to growth.\u201dIn essence, she said that Yahoo was no longer deteriorating and was poised for better times \u2014 not in 2016, perhaps, but 2017.Investors seemed not quite sure how to react to the news, which came with the release of Yahoo\u2019s quarterly results. Yahoo shares, which slumped for most of Tuesday as the overall market fell, at first perked up. But in after-hours trading, the stock declined slightly.\u201cThe company is open to all options,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that Yahoo as an independent company no longer exists within two years.\u201d\u201cEach quarter is worse than the last,\u201d Starboard wrote in a letter, adding that requiring \u201canother year for shareholders to wait while the existing leadership continues to destroy value is not acceptable.\u201dStarboard did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But SpringOwl Asset Management, a firm whose investors have been publicly critical of Yahoo\u2019s management, were not satisfied with the proposed changes or happy about Ms. Mayer\u2019s attitude.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cI expected defiance, and I expected a convoluted solution,\u201d said Eric Jackson of SpringOwl. \u201cMy expectations were exceeded on both counts.\u201dHe noted that Yahoo, despite supposedly being willing to entertain offers, did not mention hiring an investment firm to facilitate the process. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this is a real shift or not,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Ms. Mayer said in the interview that the company already had retained advisers to help with the spinoff, and they would help evaluate any offers for the core assets. The board, she said, would be \u201creceptive\u201d to offers.Yahoo\u2019s language on Tuesday is likely to formally begin what could be months of inquiries from both strategic and financial suitors. Some have been open in expressing their interest: Late last year, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, said at a conference that he would look at buying Yahoo if it were put up for sale.As Ms. Mayer looks to complete her fourth year as chief executive, Yahoo stubbornly remains a marginally profitable company that is not growing. That was underlined in its fourth-quarter earnings report.Revenue came in at $1.273 billion, compared with $1.253 billion in 2014. Operating earnings were 13 cents a share, in line with forecasts. Last year, Yahoo earned 30 cents a share in the quarter.Yahoo also recorded a $4.46 billion charge in the quarter for certain businesses, including its blogging site Tumblr, which it acquired for $1 billion.Mr. Jackson of SpringOwl said that Tumblr had been Ms. Mayer\u2019s signature acquisition, and that she had increased the number of employees when she began at Yahoo. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to sharpen our focus,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she do that three and a half years ago?\u201dKenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the conference call, \u201cI do feel comfortable that we can do it this year.\u201dYahoo was a mess when Ms. Mayer arrived from Google. The executive suite was a revolving door. The company\u2019s market share in search was dropping. Yahoo Mail was an also-ran and efforts in mobile were minimal.Statistics released this week by eMarketer, a research firm, showed just how much Yahoo was struggling.In 2015, Yahoo captured $3.37 billion in digital ad revenue worldwide, or 2 percent of the market, eMarketer estimated. That is down from a 2.4 percent share in 2014. Mobile ads were equally dismal.In search, Yahoo is barely holding its own. It will capture 2.1 percent of the $94.07 billion worldwide search market this year, the same share as in 2015, eMarketer said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Maybe the same thing, or worse.In December, Yahoo ditched plans to spin off its valuable stake in the Chinese online commerce powerhouse Alibaba. After Yahoo devoted years to studying the mechanics, the United States government signaled that Yahoo would have to pay Uncle Sam its cut. That\u2019s why Yahoo is now studying other options.Time could maybe find a way to make good use of Yahoo\u2019s nearly one billion users. In theory, there should be opportunities to sell advertising more tactically and find more readers. Time did not, however, capitalize on a similar strategy when its former corporate parent, Time Warner, was absorbed by AOL. Indeed, Time\u2019s chief executive, Joseph A. Ripp, served as vice chairman of AOL after the merger. That deal was supposed to give Time\u2019s publications access to millions of eyes. The experiment failed badly.What\u2019s more, the arcane and rarely enlisted deal structure Time would use has tripped up others. Procter & Gamble, for one, wound up having to abandon its reverse Morris Trust plan to unload Pringles a few years ago for a straight sale to a different buyer. Yahoo can ill afford further delays to sorting itself out, and the maneuver is a time-consuming one. With other deep-pocketed suitors like Comcast and Verizon circling, there may yet be a simple solution for Yahoo.Of course, Paul Taubman\u2019s investment bank, PJT Partners, one of three firms advising Yahoo\u2019s board panel, just used a reverse Morris Trust to acquire Blackstone\u2019s advisory business.

Instead, she has focused on trying to streamline and improve the core business while shaping a tax-free transaction to hand off the company\u2019s $25 billion stake in Alibaba to Yahoo shareholders.Some investors have lost faith in Ms. Mayer and her strategy, however. After three and a half years as chief, she has shown little progress in fixing the 21-year-old company, whose many challenges have been a Waterloo for several leaders.Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management, is among those who have been pushing for radical change.\u201cThings are moving in the right direction, and we\u2019re happy about that,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday.But he added that it was unclear whether the board would agree to any transactions. Mr. Jackson and other investors said they still expected Starboard to field a rival slate of directors for election at Yahoo\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting to keep the pressure on the board for a sale.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.In a statement on Friday, the board said it was \u201cthoroughly committed to exploring strategic alternatives while simultaneously supporting management and the employees in their implementation of Yahoo\u2019s strategic plan.\u201d It added, \u201cWe believe that pursuing these complementary paths is in the best interests of our shareholders and will maximize value.\u201dYahoo hinted that it would be more interested in selling parts of the business rather than all of it. \u201cIn addition to the reverse spin, there are strategic alternatives that could help us achieve the separation, while strengthening our business,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement.Some of Yahoo\u2019s divisions, such as its small-business services unit, have already been designated as tangential to the company\u2019s principal business.Tumblr could also be cleaved off and would be attractive to outside buyers \u2014 Facebook was interested in the New York-based blogging service before Yahoo bought it in 2013 for $1.1 billion \u2014 but it also helps prop up Yahoo\u2019s weak use numbers, especially among young people.Flurry, the mobile analytics business that Yahoo bought two years ago, also would be appealing. It is used by about 800,000 independent apps and would give a strategic buyer an instant entry with software developers. But Yahoo has been integrating its ad sales technology with Tumblr, and unwinding that would be complex.Robert Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said Wall Street was unlikely to be satisfied with a few asset sales.\u201cBy far, what investors want and will push for is the cleanest, fastest solution that optimizes value, and that is selling the core,\u201d Mr. Peck said.The board has tapped financial advisers, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Paul J. Taubman\u2019s firm, PJT Partners, and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to help with the review process.The committee will recommend to the board what it determines to be the best transaction \u2014 if one exists.The company declined to make any other additional disclosures about the sales process.Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco, and Leslie Picker from New York.Advertisement"}

In recent years, iQiyi\u2019s executives have said repeatedly that they are planning to list the company in the United States in the next few years. Listing the video site, which Baidu acquired in 2012, allows it to retain talent by offering new stock incentives and greater independence to the company\u2019s leaders.Baidu competes with its Chinese rivals Alibaba and Tencent to invest in online-to-offline services, the sorts of businesses where the Chinese use smartphones to order things as diverse as meals and massages brought to their homes. This has been an expensive undertaking, with Baidu operating profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 falling by more than a third from a year ago in part because of rising costs.The buyers would expect that Qiyi would remain a strategic partner after the transaction and enter into cooperation agreements with Baidu if the deal were consummated, Baidu said.\u201cThere can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any legally binding agreement will be executed or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated,\u201d Baidu added.Such a transaction by a management-involved group for iQiyi would lighten Baidu\u2019s burden in another expensive area: streaming video.

The deal would give the buyers a name that has faded amid intense competition from Google\u2019s Chrome and other browsers but still has a following in the developing world.Opera, a Norwegian browser developed in the 1990s, gained prominence a decade ago with a browser designed specifically for mobile phones that used compression technology to speed download times.

It is the top browser in Africa, according to StatCounter, and it is the third most popular in Russia and India and the fourth in Indonesia.Opera Software, the browser\u2019s parent company, said in August last year that it was undertaking a strategic review. It has reported annual losses over the past two years, and its growth prospects have disappointed investors. Even after takeover rumors drove up its shares in recent days, they are still down about one-quarter from a year ago.The group has offered 71 Norwegian kroner, or $8.31, a share, a premium of about 56 percent, based on the average share price over the past 30 days.Opera said that the agreement would give Opera access to Kunlun and Qihoo\u2019s Internet users in China, as well as funding. Kunlun and Qihoo will also be able to sell their products to Opera users and use its mobile advertising platform.Qihoo runs its own mobile browser, which it could combine with Opera\u2019s, and it also could benefit from the company\u2019s advertising network. Kunlun, which makes and licenses games, could use Opera\u2019s apps as a way to broaden the distribution of those games.Opera\u2019s board has unanimously decided to recommend that shareholders accept the offer.The deal is still conditional on Kunlun\u2019s getting approval at its general meeting in March to participate in the consortium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Decision to Explore a Sale Exposes a Weak Board", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorInstead, the company said that \u201cmarket perceptions\u201d dictated that it do another transaction. The board would spin off Yahoo itself and, for good measure, said it would consider \u201calternatives.\u201dBut only a few months later, the board has again shifted course, this time initiating a full-fledged process to sell the company. An independent committee of the board has been formed, and lawyers and three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 have been hired. Even the hiring of three banks shows the bloat at Yahoo as it searches for someone to lead it somewhere.The company says that this is only one option, but independent committees have a life of their own. The train has started and it will probably stop at a sale.Moreover, it is nearly impossible to run a turnaround plan when you are actively exploring a sale and are contacting bidders. The board knows this, and so the talk of a sale being \u201conly an alternative\u201d is cheap.It\u2019s exactly what a weak board would do at this time \u2014 throw its hands up, despite the possible value of waiting.This is a result in part of the failures of Ms. Mayer. A rock star hire, one of her ideas was that Yahoo could be a top-tier player again if it acted like her old employer, Google. That meant spending billions of dollars on acquisitions, giving employees free food and free iPhones, sponsoring the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and throwing multimillion-dollar holiday parties.All of this would be fine if you are Google or Facebook and are minting cash. But it seemed wrong for Yahoo to again sponsor the World Economic Forum this year. You may suspect that many at the forum were looking at the Yahoo executives and thinking that this would be their last year there. What a waste of money, and what bad public relations.All this would make it hard for any board to maintain control. The default, of course, is to pull the ripcord. I had thought that the Yahoo board was taking a stronger stance by trying to buy a year with the Yahoo spinoff, but the board has buckled under pressure, with a potential proxy contest from the hedge fund Starboard Value looming.Yahoo\u2019s bankers will now call the usual subjects and run an auction. This typically takes about one to two months, although given the fact that everyone knows the situation here, it may go more quickly.During that time, indications of interest will be received and the field will be narrowed to a few bidders. Private equity players will undoubtedly bid, but so will strategic ones like Verizon, which bought AOL.Yahoo is likely to sell for less than all of the money Ms. Mayer spent. If she had sought to liquidate Yahoo as soon as she took over and distributed the proceeds, Yahoo shareholders would have fared much better than they will now.Whatever the outcome, Ms. Mayer will be able to parachute out of Yahoo with a big paycheck \u2014 more than $28 million, according to company\u2019s last proxy statement, although a decline in the stock price will make this less. And that is on top of the more than $100 million she has already earned at Yahoo for her years there. The notion of pay for performance loses out once again.This does not mean that an agreement of the Yahoo board to sell the company is the end of the Yahoo story. Some hedge funds like SpringOwl are likely to oppose a sale as insufficient. Other funds like Starboard are salivating for a sale. Indeed, Starboard is likely to try to unseat the Yahoo board in a proxy contest, if only to make sure the board does not again change its mind and decide not to sell.So the next fight to come at Yahoo will be whether the company is selling too cheaply.It all brings to mind a truism on Wall Street, that once you are at the mercy of financial engineers and schemes, it is over. Say good night, Yahoo.Advertisement"}
