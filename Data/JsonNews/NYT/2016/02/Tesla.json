{"Headline": "Video Review: The BMW X5 xDrive40e, a Hybrid for the Future", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byDrivenINEXPENSIVE gasoline has fueled sales of the crossovers and sport utility vehicles that Americans love. That\u2019s good for the automakers\u2019 bottom line, but it also presents a challenge as fuel economy standards get stricter.It would appear that this technology is the way to go for the foreseeable future, since batteries that take cars hundreds of miles are expensive (looking at you, Tesla) and there is no refueling infrastructure yet in place for cars using hydrogen fuel cell technology.With a pure battery range of 14 miles, the 40e is no Volt. It charges in three hours on 220-volt current, seven hours on 110. It can reach 75 miles an hour on battery power alone; the gas engine assists from there. It does not have to be charged up to operate, but that defeats the purpose, right?In total, there are 308 horses and a healthy 332 pound-feet of torque. The lithium-ion battery pack is beneath the cargo floor where in the X5 35i, the 40e\u2019s fully fossil-fuel sibling, the third row of seats would live. The 40e is strictly a five-seat affair.There are three drive modes: Max, Save and Auto. Max provides pure electric power; Save forces gas operation and even charges the battery a bit. Most owners will use Auto, in which the 40e behaves much like any hybrid. The difference is that the smooth electric-to-gas transition happens at higher speeds, up to 45 miles an hour.Impressively, the 40e drives much like a standard 35i.The brake pedal feels a touch disconnected, common with hybrids. From inside the cabin, the quiet 4-cylinder engine seems as if it\u2019s in the next county.Quicker than a Prius, the 40e bolts from zero to 60 miles an hour in 6.5 seconds with a standard all-wheel-drive system that\u2019s always active. It drives well, though at 5,220 pounds, it\u2019s around 430 pounds heavier than the 35i, and that mass is felt. The hippopotamus ballerinas from \u201cFantasia\u201d come to mind. It\u2019s an S.U.V., not an M3.Fuel economy depends on how it\u2019s driven and how frequently it\u2019s charged. If you understand the government rating of 56 miles per gallon equivalent, you\u2019re smarter than average. I saw everything from 57 m.p.g. (driving carefully in urban conditions) to 21 m.p.g. with a hard foot and a spent battery. My total average for the week was 31 when I plugged it in nightly.Whatever the fuel economy, occupants will enjoy the interior. Soothing accent lighting bathes the entire cabin. Seats are bolstered for a wide range of posteriors. The 40e is most efficient when a destination is set on the navigation system (by drawing letters and numbers on the iDrive function knob) since the eDrive takes into consideration the topography of the route. Be aware that the drivetrain turns off if you open the front door. It\u2019s a safety feature.In the rear, a low-profile drive shaft tunnel keeps the back seat spacious. Two adults can stretch out; three smaller passengers should be comfortable. The seats split 40-20-40. The battery pack eliminates the cargo area available in the 35i without the back seat option, but the trunk space remains the same size.Today\u2019s cheap gas makes it tough to break even financially. The car starts at $63,095 (the version I tested was $71,995) and the eDrive hybrid system is $5,000 more. A $4,668 federal tax credit nearly covers that bill, but don\u2019t forget the charger installation. Still, if plug-in hybrids are the future of efficiency, we could all do a lot worse than drive something as well engineered as the X5.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/automobiles/autoreviews/video-review-the-bmw-x5-40e-a-hybrid-for-the-future.htmlAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "End of the Road May Be Near for Side Mirrors", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byWheelsBEFORE engineers dreamed of eliminating drivers in cars, they imagined eliminating the side mirrors. The protuberances are ugly, create aerodynamic drag, and their associated blind spots are the bane of parking-challenged drivers everywhere.But now, a long-sought solution looks closer to finally stripping cars of their Mickey Mouse ears, as many automakers demonstrate video systems that replace side mirrors with cameras.Continental, a major parts and systems supplier to automakers, calls them digital mirrors.In a customized Mercedes-Benz CLS, Continental demonstrated how its system would work. Thumb-size video cameras on the exterior of the car replace the side-mounted mirrors and use interior screens on the left and right side of the dashboard to deliver views of what is next to and behind the car.The screens are near where a driver would normally look to check a mirror, and the camera views are wider than what a physical mirror can provide, eliminating blind spots along the side of the car. The cameras, which can automatically adjust to reduce glare from sunlight or increase brightness at night, are also helpful in tight parking spots.\u201cNo matter where someone stands behind you, you can see them,\u201d said Philipp Hoffmann, BMW\u2019s project manager for camera monitor systems, as we backed up in a crowded parking lot during the International CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last month.We were in an exotic-looking BMW i8 sports car with tiny cameras on stalks instead of side mirrors. Together with a camera just above the rear window, the three views can be displayed on a high-resolution monitor that replaces the rearview mirror. A glance up gives the driver a picture of what is beside and behind the vehicle.Mr. Hoffmann pushed a button and the rearview monitor image transformed into a virtual panoramic rear view that electronically stitched all three camera pictures into a seamless image. The resulting live image made it appear as if nothing was behind the driver to obscure the view.Mr. Hoffmann also demonstrated how the video cameras, which can recognize and gauge the speed of objects around the car, can be tied into automatic braking, parking and collision systems to protect the driver and the i8\u2019s glossy finish.Because of the potential benefits, other technology suppliers, like Valeo and Visteon, are also keen on mirrorless systems and hope that regulations requiring old-fashioned physical mirrors will be amended.Mr. Hoffmann said he expected to begin road testing of the mirrorless systems in Europe this year, quickly followed by additional testing in Asia. He remained hopeful that the United States would follow suit soon.Rearview cameras provide a precedent. Those that eliminate the blind spots directly behind vehicles are already deemed a significant safety improvement and will be mandatory in cars and light trucks in the United States by 2018.LaneWatch uses a camera on the passenger side to give the driver a video view in the dashboard screen of the right side lane whenever the turn signal is activated. Mr. Zuby said there was a correlation between the LaneWatch system and a reduction in accident insurance claims, although further study was needed.Using cameras instead of physical mirrors could also end dangling damaged mirrors. To replace a typical mirror, which features built-in defrost, turn signal and blind spot sensors, can be expensive, as much as $946 on a 2015 Acura RLX, according to the insurance institute. Mr. McConnell at Continental noted potential savings in building cars that no longer need the structural support for side-mounted mirrors.Still, the mirrorless demonstrations from Daimler, BMW and Continental show that the systems will present a challenge to drivers. Unlike other safety systems that are installed and applied without the drivers\u2019 knowledge or input, like electronic stability control and airbags, digital mirrors require training and practice to use.Looking up into the rearview mirror, for example, to see what is beside you in the BMW i8 is not instinctive for a driver trained to perform shoulder checks.\u201cYes, it may require some driver training,\u201d Mr. Hoffmann acknowledged. Further refinements need to be worked out, too. The BMW\u2019s panoramic video mode has a slight fun-house mirror effect, for example. .On the other hand, having a single panoramic video view may be an improvement over the combination of old and new technology now deployed in cars that use a rearview camera and traditional side mirrors.Advertisement"}

The have-nots, which are the companies that are trying to raise now, are going to have to dramatically restructure their companies. The haves will thrive while the have-nots sadly may find themselves put out of business because they found themselves on the wrong side of the fund-raising cycle.\u201dDo you think Schreier is right?Here\u2019s what I think, informed by talking to people much smarter than myself: After the recession, we had a wealth of money flowing in from sources that weren\u2019t there just a few years before: sovereign wealth funds from Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Russia. You have hedge funds and other money managers whose clients want to diversify their investments. For that, they look to tech.On the other side, you have a preponderance of entrepreneurs who, for the last few years, have been able to toss out any stupid idea they wish and get at least a few million dollars thrown at them to pursue it. That behavior, according to the folks I talk to, is abnormal. There are too many start-ups on the market and too many bad ideas still limping along because the money hasn\u2019t dried up yet.So fast-forward to now. Public markets are insane. Investors are getting nervous, and the money faucets are closing off. The window for going through an initial public offering, at least in the next 12 to 18 months, seems to be much narrower than it has been over the last two years. So what does that mean?I like to think of it as \u201cThe Lion King\u201d meets \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\u201d Circle of life, and all that.Obviously, this won\u2019t be welcomed with open arms by all investors or start-ups. But the people I\u2019ve spoken with generally think this is a positive progression for the start-up environment as a whole, and a necessary cycle that will only happen over and over again. It\u2019s like nature. Death begets rebirth, ad infinitum.So things will be bad, but maybe not for everyone. That\u2019s good, right?Anyway, it started snowing again, so I guess my dog doo problem is temporarily fixed. How do people live in this city?See you soon!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CUNY Schools to Lure Foreign Entrepreneurs With New Visa Program", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byThe entrepreneurs will qualify for a skilled-worker visa, known as an H-1B. Applicants need an employer to sponsor them for the visas, which are extremely limited: The visas are capped at 65,000 a year, with another 20,000 available for foreign students who have earned graduate degrees in the United States. Last year, 233,000 people entered the lottery for the visas, with about two-thirds of them losing out.But people working with nonprofits and institutions of higher education are exempt from the caps, and IN2NYC will use its partnerships with CUNY to help the entrepreneurs get the visas.Mr. Ryan said many New York companies had to hire employees abroad, so being able to keep talent in the city was a priority. \u201cIt\u2019s not as impactful as opening up the number of H-1B visas,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great step forward.\u201dMaria Torres-Springer, the president of the development corporation, said the program would build on New York\u2019s history of being a welcoming place to immigrants. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing innovation hubs really beginning to blossom all over the city,\u201d she said, mentioning a clean-technology incubator she recently visited in Brooklyn, made up mostly of immigrant workers.\u201cThe program builds on the momentum, in a way where international entrepreneurs who want to relocate in the city now have a pathway to do that, as opposed to navigating what is currently a complex system.\u201dIN2NYC will work with seven campuses: Baruch College, City College, the College of Staten Island, LaGuardia Community College, Lehman College, Medgar Evers College and Queens College.Entrepreneurs will form a board of directors, most of whom will be American citizens or permanent residents, to establish the employer-employee relationship that an H-1B visa requires. Since entrepreneurs will be employed at a college for more than half their time, collaborating with professors and students, they will be exempt from the H-1B visa caps.\u201cThe impact of an immigration lawyer to help the next Elon Musk with no visa or a college student with no status has never been more significant,\u201d said Peter F. Asaad, the managing legal partner of Immigration Solutions Group, an immigration law firm in Washington that is providing counsel to New York City.Mr. Musk, the founder of SpaceX and the co-founder of Tesla Motors, was born in South Africa and came to the United States as a college student. Mr. Brin, the co-founder of Google, was born in Russia.Mr. Asaad has advised New York City on previous immigration programs involving entrepreneurs, and he thinks there will be a large pool of applicants who will already have \u201csubstantial amounts of angel investors and other sources believing in their company.\u201dThe development corporation expects that each entrepreneur will initially employ at least three people. Applications will be accepted in late spring, with the program scheduled to start in autumn.Mr. Ryan sees only an upside.\u201cEven if there are only a certain number who take advantage of this,\u201d he said, \u201cone of them will end up starting a really successful company, and that company will employ 500 people and create huge tax dollars.

MetLife sued the government in January 2015 over the designation, also known as Sifi. It argued that the agency improperly imagined a situation in which the insurer was in financial distress and measured the predicted impact, as opposed to considering the probability that it would find itself on the brink of bankruptcy. The government, MetLife says, initially said it would consider that probability when examining the risks in the firm. Banks are already subject to stricter supervision under the Dodd-Frank reform law, but regulators can also look at other financial institutions, like insurers, based on factors such as how connected the firm is to other companies.
