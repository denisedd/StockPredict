{"Headline": "Bankers Grapple With How to Help Emerging Markets", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 After a week of discussions here, bankers and policy makers agreed that stemming the rush of investments from emerging markets was one of the most important challenges facing the global economy. But there was little agreement on how to actually do that.On official panels, in closed-room sessions and over drinks in Lima restaurants, market participants struggled to come to grips with the persistent flows of money escaping emerging-market stocks and bonds in search of safer investment shores.\u201cWe have never seen something like this,\u201d said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks. Mr. Tran said that he was expecting net outflows from emerging markets to be around $800 billion for this year and next \u2014 by far the largest amount since institutions began investing in these markets in the late 1980s.The fear is that these numbers could increase substantially, especially if China\u2019s currency weakens further. That could result in a rolling series of emerging-market crises.And Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, said at a panel discussion on Saturday that if you had just awakened from a yearslong slumber and had to make a decision about raising rates, you would most likely choose not to do so.\u201cWe have a global economic growth problem,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.But those on the front lines of the outflows of funds from the emerging markets \u2014 central bankers in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia and Mexico \u2014 are beginning to say that the Fed\u2019s decision to hold back has actually made their job more difficult. That is because instead of staying put, or making new investments, investors are rushing out all the faster, spooked that the Fed has larger fears about China and other emerging markets.\u201cI heard time and again this week from governors of emerging-market central banks that it\u2019s not the hike itself that worries them,\u201d said Jacob A. Frenkel, the chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase International and the former head of Israel\u2019s central bank. \u201cIt\u2019s how much and when it occurs.\u201dSome experts argued that money would continue to flow out of China, the emerging market that most worries investors, regardless of whether the Fed raised rates.For years, Chinese savers were happy to keep their wealth in the renminbi because they knew it would keep its value, said David Lubin, head of emerging-market economics at Citigroup. Now, with the renminbi expected to devalue more, \u201cthey are looking to shift into dollars,\u201d Mr. Lubin said.This trend will continue regardless of what the Fed does, he said.The mantra, from the I.M.F. on down, has been that emerging-market governments need to regain the confidence of investors by keeping budget deficits under control and not letting their currency declines run out of control.\u201cEmerging-market countries have to put their own house in order,\u201d said Ariosto Revoredo de Carvalho, a senior executive at Brazil\u2019s central bank. \u201cThere is no cavalry here \u2014 no external help coming from China or the Fed. That puts more pressure on governments to do their own work.\u201dAnd while there have been a few calls from economists for countries most vulnerable to outflows to impose capital controls to make taking money out of these economies more difficult, most central bankers at the Lima meetings rejected such an option.\u201cThe first thing an investor asks when he comes in is where is the exit,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank, who was speaking on a panel about monetary policies in Latin America. \u201cIf he does not know where it is, he won\u2019t come in.\u201dAs an open economy, Mr. Carstens said, Mexico depends too much on these investors for its financing needs to scare them away with such policies.Over the last week, emerging-market currencies and stock markets have experienced a bounce of sorts \u2014 halting what had been a deep slide.But analysts are not convinced that financial stability can return to these markets without a greater sense of certainty about what the Fed plans to do.\u201cDelaying an increase in rates only increases volatility and uncertainty in emerging markets,\u201d said David Fernandez, a currency and bond specialist at Barclays in Singapore. \u201cEmerging markets will continue to see outflows.\u201dThe I.M.F.\u2019s public stance in support of the Fed has provoked some criticism here \u2014 especially because the fund, more than any other institution, is aware of how dangerous the combination of uncertainty and volatile capital flows can be for emerging-market economies.\u201cWhen I travel around the world, I find hardly anyone supporting the Fed\u2019s policy on interest rates,\u201d said a senior European official, who did not want to be publicly identified criticizing the I.M.F. \u201cThe fund has become very short-term-oriented.\u201dSome also saw the fund\u2019s support of the Fed as going beyond its mandate, which is to keep an eye on the financial health of its member countries.The fund has heard the criticisms.David Lipton, the No. 2 executive at the I.M.F., said the fund was aware that this liquidity had adverse side effects. But, he argued, if lower rates were needed to keep the United States economy healthy, then that should be the course of action.For the time being, emerging markets will keep playing a waiting game.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unwrapping the Cable TV Bundle", "Date": "2015-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTV TransformedIt has been a turbulent few months for media companies. In early August, media stocks including Disney, Viacom and Time Warner fell sharply. Investors seem to be worried, principally, about one thing: The prospective undoing of the expensive cable television bundle.People seem to be growing agitated with their cable bills, especially as more online choices like Netflix or Hulu are being offered at a fraction of the price.Most industry analysts agree that the bundle, as it exists now, is in trouble. Or, as CBS\u2019s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, put it earlier this year: \u201cThe days of the 500-channel universe are over.\u201d\u201cThe days of the 150-channel universe in the home, while not necessarily over, are changing rapidly,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people who are going to be slicing it and dicing it in different ways.\u201dBut what does all that slicing and dicing mean for consumers? There is more television programming than ever, and far more choice of when and where to watch it. But in a few years, if the cable bundle as it exists is coming apart, will people who want to watch a variety of television actually pay more or less?Analysts are divided, but some see a path for a cheaper cable bill. That will result from what one analyst described as increased offerings of so-called skinny bundles, or slimmer packages than the hundred-plus cable channels of today.\u201cThe skinny bundle is going to pick up speed,\u201d said Tony Lenoir, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. \u201cThere will be more choices, and that is all good from a consumer\u2019s point of view.\u201dAll good, in this case, could include the amount a consumer spends, but how the consumer will spend in the new environment is an open question.You might drop an expensive cable bill to get a slimmer package, like one offered by Sling for about $20 a month that comes with greatly reduced channel offerings. Then that could be supplemented by other online services like Netflix ($8 a month), HBO Now ($15 a month) or Amazon Prime ($8.25 a month). But what offerings will be available in the future is unclear.\u201cI\u2019m not sure the savings will go into buying HBO, Netflix and Hulu,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG. \u201cYou could probably spend some of the difference but you spend it on other forms of entertainment.\u201dThat could include online gaming, or a future in which a YouTube star will command paid subscriptions for access to content.\u201cThis is where it gets interesting,\u201d said Michael Goodman, the director of digital media strategies at Strategy Analytics. \u201cThe pendulum is clearly swinging in the direction of skinny bundles, and likely at some point you\u2019ll start to see \u00e0 la carte programming. But be careful what you ask for.\u201dRight now, there is pressure for change and resistance to it. ESPN has lost roughly three million subscribers in the past year, according to Nielsen, because of people\u2019s cancellation of their cable subscriptions.Media analysts were skeptical about the FiOS Custom TV package because it would charge additional fees if people wanted to add channels from a range of categories like children\u2019s and pop-culture programming.Given such pricing tactics, some analysts still defend the merits of the bundle.\u201cDo you want to lose 90 percent of your content and save the equivalent of three glasses of wine?\u201d said David Bank, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a solution looking for a problem, from a pure economic perspective.\u201dThe bundle offers choice and is a \u201creally good system we have going,\u201d Mr. Bank said. And he is not convinced that the majority of Americans are going to opt out in the next five years.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think the revolution is about to hit us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to call outside of the next 10 years.\u201dThe problem, analysts said, isn\u2019t the channel bundle itself: It\u2019s the fees providers charge, including set-top box rental and router fees. As a result, the average cable bill has ballooned to $92 a month, according to SNL Kagan.\u201cWhen Comcast says it costs $50 or $75 or whatever, it doesn\u2019t really cost that much,\u201d said Mr. Goodman of Strategy Analytics. \u201cIt costs another $30 to $50 more when you pay those various fees.\u201dMr. Goodman says this makes a service like PlayStation Vue \u2014 available starting at $50 a month on Sony game consoles and other devices \u2014 attractive and possibly a model for the future.\u201cSony does not have to charge you for a set-top box and they don\u2019t have to recoup the price of the equipment because you already paid for your PlayStation,\u201d he said.PlayStation Vue is not without drawbacks: It does not offer ESPN, for example. But it represents the sort of arithmetic that has made some analysts optimistic that consumers will pay less in the next five years or so for similar skinny bundles.The future, Mr. Goodman argues, is one in which the consumer will likely pay less but will have to be very vigilant about what to mix and match \u2014 or slice and dice.\u201cMore choice,\u201d he continued, \u201cmeans you\u2019re going to have to pay attention to what you\u2019re buying.\u201dAn article on Monday about alternatives to the traditional cable television bundle referred incorrectly to PlayStation Vue\u2019s channel lineup. It includes, not excludes, the Discovery Channel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Economy Really in Trouble? A Debate", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking StockI write about economics for a living. Part of my job is to look into the maw of economic data, financial market indicators, anecdotal reports from businesses and whatever else I can get my hands on, and turn it all into a crisp, clear narrative about the United States and global economies.But right now I\u2019m stuck. I have no idea how the United States economy is doing. And the closer I look at the data, the more contradictory it looks.There is also a strong case that the United States economy is robust enough to withstand whatever challenges might arise from overseas, and that the evidence of a slowdown is scattered and overstated. Fewer people have filed for unemployment insurance in recent weekly readings, for example, than any time since 1973.I\u2019ve tried several times in the last few weeks to convince myself that one of those stories is correct, but just can\u2019t decide between them. And because The New York Times is not fond of headlines that include the \u201cshruggie\u201d emoticon (for the uninitiated, that would be \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af), I have held off writing anything.Why am I telling you all this? Because sometimes the most accurate portrayal of a situation revolves around uncertainty \u2014 and because we journalists aren\u2019t always honest about that. This is my effort to be a little more honest.Rather than picking an analytical case and pretending to be more certain than I am, I want to walk readers through the conflicting evidence. Below, I do so in the form of the debate that has been playing out within my own head \u2014 and, very likely, around conference tables at every economic research group and central bank you can think of.It sure feels as if we\u2019re on the verge of something bad. The expansion is six years old, making it already the fourth-longest since World War II. If the economy does soften, the Federal Reserve is out of ammunition to do much of anything about it. This feels a little like late 2000, when there were signs the economy was losing momentum even though growth was still technically positive. Then in 2001 there was a mild recession.Whoa, not so fast. Back then there was a huge correction in the stock market and downturn in business investment that caused the recession. What are the sectors that you see correcting in 2015 or 2016 that put the economy at that much risk?Emerging markets, especially China? They\u2019ve had years of huge capital inflows, in no small part because of Fed policies, that papered over longer-term problems. Now the capital is flowing in the other direction, and the correction is looking to be vicious.Sure, but why would that cause anything more than modest ripples for the United States economy? Total exports to China were $124 billion last year, about 0.7 percent of United States G.D.P. And I know you\u2019re going to mention financial linkages, but it\u2019s not as if American banks are sitting on a ton of Chinese government debt. Even if things get worse in emerging markets, isn\u2019t this more like 1998, when an emerging markets crisis enveloped East Asia and Russia? As a reminder, the United States economy grew 4.7 percent in 1999, faster than in the preceding 15 years.Yeah, but there\u2019s no doubt that the financial markets, including in the United States, have been flashing warning signs since this summer.Sure, markets have been jumpy lately. But when you step back and take a bit of a long view, is it really anything to sweat about? The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was actually up very slightly for the year at Monday\u2019s close (up 0.6 percent, to be precise). Long-term Treasury bond rates have fallen a good bit since the summer but are still higher than they were back in the spring, meaning that the bond market isn\u2019t exactly panicking.Maybe Wall Street is just whining because after five years in which asset prices soared much more than the real economy, markets are taking a breather while the rest of the economy catches up?Maybe, but there are some cracks showing in the data on the real economy too. The last couple of jobs reports have been really bad! This month the data on retail sales and surveys of businesses have shown the same kind of softness. Maybe the economy is like Wile E. Coyote running off the cliff, and as soon as we look down we\u2019ll see it was all a mirage and fall.Come on, that\u2019s not how the economy works.For the economy to fall into recession, something has to cause it. A financial crisis that freezes up the credit system, tight monetary policy intended to fend off inflation, a collapse in the stock market, something. Recessions don\u2019t just happen for no particular reason.It\u2019s true that the economy is starting to feel an impact of the strong dollar (resulting in weaker exports) and cheaper oil (which means less oil and gas exploration). But we\u2019ve seen soft patches like this many times before. For example, job growth has been really weak the last couple of months, but it was about equally weak in June and July of 2013, and nobody even remembers that soft patch.And if you look at the broadest measures of the economy, there\u2019s not much sign of a downturn at all. For example, over the first nine months of 2015, United States gross domestic product rose at about a 2 percent annual rate, including a 1.5 percent third-quarter pace reported Thursday, broadly similar to the last several years. This could just be a case where people are freaked out by the market moves and are straining to discern a downshift in the economy that isn\u2019t really there.Yeah, but look at all the anxiety we\u2019re hearing this earnings season. Big, stalwart companies like Caterpillar and Walmart have downgraded their forecasts. Surely those are the canaries in the recessionary coal mine.There you go with the clich\u00e9s again. When you look a little more closely at some of these disappointing forecasts, what they\u2019re really telling us about the state of the economy is far more ambiguous.Take Caterpillar. Yes, it slashed its revenue forecast for 2015 and said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the next three years. But the major reason is the downturn in mining and energy exploration because of cheaper oil and other commodities. Obviously, it\u2019s too bad for those people who will lose their jobs, but the flip side is cheaper gasoline and other fuels for American consumers, which is an economic boost.We\u2019ve had years in which the problem in the economy has been companies that won\u2019t invest and workers who aren\u2019t getting pay raises. Walmart\u2019s earnings are suffering because of the opposite! That\u2019s good news for the economy, even if it\u2019s bad news for Walmart shareholders.O.K., Pollyanna, anything out there that does make you nervous?Oh, sure. The drop in stock prices and rise in borrowing costs for riskier companies means that capital is more expensive, and the dollar keeps strengthening on currency markets that will keep holding things back. And if I\u2019m wrong about any of this, the economy really does lack the shock absorbers right now that would help it: The Fed\u2019s most effective tools are pretty well spent, and there\u2019s no way a Republican Congress would even consider fiscal stimulus.So I get being nervous, but this doesn\u2019t feel like a moment when there are huge imbalances sitting out there due for a correction.I hope you\u2019re right. But if the 2008 crisis taught us anything, it\u2019s that trouble can spread in ways that are hard to predict, even if you think you know what\u2019s going on.Yeah, but what happened in 2008 was a once-a-century kind of storm. If you always think that the big one is imminent, most of the time you\u2019ll turn out to be wrong.Advertisement"}

They differ only in the proportions of these allocations. They are what is known as \u201cfunds of funds\u201d: they don\u2019t buy stocks and bonds directly but rather hold shares in four other Vanguard index funds: its Total Stock Market index fund, Total International stock index fund, Total Bond Market II index fund and Total International bond index fund.\u201cLifeStrategy Income is one of our single-fund solutions,\u201d said Francis M.

Vanguard responded to research showing that too many investors have a home bias \u2014 they invest too much of their money in their home country and end up with insufficient diversification, Mr. Kinniry said.\u201cOur rationale was accessibility and affordability,\u201d he said.

The managers bought in about five years ago and have watched the stock mostly climb since.\u201cStarbucks overplayed back in the 2000s when they focused almost exclusively on growing their number of stores,\u201d Mr. Ficklin said. After shuttering several hundred underperforming outlets, the chain has aimed to increase same-store sales and find new goods to sell besides its many coffee concoctions. \u201cThey\u2019ve rolled out better food offerings and are selling more tea,\u201d he said. Starbucks is also striving to keep expanding in emerging markets like China.An advantage of investing in large, established outfits is downside protection when other stocks slip, Mr. Davidowitz said. \u201cOur portfolio tends to have lower volatility than the market,\u201d he said.Polen Growth, which has a net expense ratio of 1.25 percent, gained 0.7 percent in the third quarter.When investors short a stock, they borrow it and then sell it. When they must return the borrowed shares, they buy them. If the price has fallen, they profit. If it has risen, they lose. In theory, short sales are infinitely risky because a stock\u2019s potential rise has no ceiling.\u201cWe say there\u2019s risk in going long and in going short,\u201d Mr. Orkin said. \u201cShorts are riskier than longs on an individual basis. But when you have longs and shorts together in a portfolio, we believe it makes a lot more sense.\u201d In that view, shorting can represent an additional tool for diversification.Lately, Mr. Orkin has shorted for-profit education companies. He would not say which ones. \u201cTheir degrees are generally overpriced and of low quality,\u201d he said.He said he was also bearish on China\u2019s economic prospects and has capitalized on that belief by shorting commodity-sensitive companies like producers of copper, iron ore and mining machinery.For the fund\u2019s long positions, Mr. Orkin has lately favored the same sorts of investments that the Polen managers do: well-known, enduring companies that sell directly to consumers. The fund\u2019s recent holdings included Target, Walt Disney and Home Depot.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for stable, well-run longs,\u201d he said. Disney typifies that, with its sturdy brand and portfolio of movies, broadcast networks and theme parks. Plus, the economy has lately helped both Disney and Home Depot. \u201cLower gas prices are good for Disney\u2019s theme parks, and Home Depot is benefiting from the housing market recovery,\u201d he said.Mr. Orkin trades frequently; his fund\u2019s recent turnover ratio was 434 percent. He attributed that to his efforts to manage risk. \u201cWhen the market gets volatile, we tend to trade more,\u201d he said. But he said the goal was to achieve steady returns, even as he jumps in and out of investments. \u201cWe say we\u2019re trying to climb a staircase, not ride a roller coaster.\u201dThe fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.44 percent, returned 5.13 percent in the third quarter.Advertisement"}

Ferrari will not receive any of the proceeds from the $859 million I.P.O., at the midpoint of the range; they will mostly go to Fiat Chrysler.Fiat Chrysler will maintain an 80 percent stake after the offering and plans to distribute the rest to Fiat Chrysler\u2019s investors by 2016, according to the filing.Ferrari\u2019s history is rooted in racing. Enzo Ferrari started a team in 1929 called Scuderia Ferrari, but the company didn\u2019t produce its first car until 1947. Two decades later, Fiat acquired a 50 percent stake, which increased to 90 percent after Enzo Ferrari died in 1988. His son, Piero Ferrari, holds the remaining 10 percent, which he will keep after the I.P.O.Ferrari shipped a mere 7,255 cars last year, a tactic the company uses to cultivate a reputation for exclusivity. Of course, this low-volume strategy also limits revenue and profit growth, as Ferrari said in the section of its regulatory filing that describes potential risks of investing in the I.P.O.For the six months through June, net revenue increased 2.8 percent from the same period in 2014, and net profit rose by 10 percent, according to the filing.One of Ferrari\u2019s crucial sources of marketing is through its Formula One racing team, which has won 224 Grand Prix races and 15 drivers\u2019 world championships since Formula One began in 1950, the filing showed.Other I.P.O.s have sputtered this week. Pure Storage, a data-storage provider, was priced at the midpoint of its marketed range and decreased in its first day of trading Wednesday, while the Digicel Group, a mobile and cable services provider, canceled its I.P.O. altogether.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eye Treatment Closes In on Being First Gene Therapy Approved in U.S. ", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat could become the first gene therapy to win approval in the United States moved closer to market on Monday, when its developer announced that the medicine had succeeded in a late-stage clinical trial in treating an inherited eye disease that can cause blindness. The developer, Spark Therapeutics, said the treatment had allowed people with certain so-called inherited retinal dystrophies to more easily maneuver in dimmer light than they could before. The company said it planned to apply to the Food and Drug Administration next year for approval to sell the product.\u201cWe saw substantial restoration of vision in patients who were progressing toward complete blindness,\u201d Dr. Albert M. Maguire, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania and a lead researcher in the study, said in a news release being issued by Spark. Dr. Katherine High, Spark\u2019s president and chief scientific officer, said this was the first successful randomized, controlled trial for any gene therapy aimed at an inherited disease. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in gene therapy for most of my career,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, and I\u2019m delighted.\u201d Besides encouraging the once beleaguered field of gene therapy, the results \u2014 if interpreted positively by investors \u2014 could help lift biotechnology stocks, which have been battered recently by concerns over a backlash against high drug prices. Still, much remains unknown. Spark did not provide the actual trial data, saying only that the treatment achieved the main goal of the study as well as two out of three of its secondary goals. It is also unclear what the F.D.A. will deem sufficient for approval of the product. Spark\u2019s stock had slumped in the last two months as it changed how it would measure the results of the trial. Gene therapy involves putting healthy genes into the body to take the place of mutated genes that cause disease. There have been hundreds of trials of gene therapy in humans since 1990, and none have resulted in a medicine winning approval from the F.D.A. One gene therapy for an extremely rare disease was approved in Europe in 2012, but there are questions about its effectiveness. In the last few years, prospects and results have improved and several new gene therapy companies have gone public, including Spark. Even so, two gene therapy companies, Celladon and Avalanche Biotechnologies, had disappointing trial results recently.Spark\u2019s product, called SPK-RPE65, is aimed at retinal diseases caused by mutations in a gene called RPE65; this gene plays a role in maintaining the health of the photoreceptors in the eye. Spark estimates there are 3,500 people in the United States and five major European countries with these conditions, though the treatment would not be expected to help people whose disease had progressed past a certain point. The 31 patients in the study, ranging in age from 4 to 44, have one type of Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis, which causes night blindness and an erosion of peripheral vision, and can eventually lead to total blindness. Twenty-one of the participants were randomly assigned to have a virus carrying the RPE65 gene implanted into their eye via a surgical procedure. The 10 others, the control group, received no treatment. The main measure of effectiveness was how much light participants needed to successfully navigate an obstacle course of sorts \u2014 following black arrows on a white tile floor, going up and down steps, and avoiding objects like wastebaskets. There were seven possible levels of illumination ranging from that of a moonless summer night to that of a brightly lit office. One year later, those who had received the treatment improved by an average of two light levels, meaning they could complete the course in dimmer light than before, Dr. High said. That was better than those in the control group by a statistically significant amount, though she declined to provide the results for the control group. Two-thirds of those in the treated group were able to complete the course in the dimmest light, the level corresponding to a moonless summer night. The company said there were no serious side effects or immune system reactions in the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said Gordon Gund, chairman of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which helped pay for the development of the therapy and some earlier studies of the therapy. He said that while the condition Spark is treating is rare, \u201cthis really provides us a platform for many other successful gene therapies.\u201d One question is how long the effect will last. Theoretically, gene therapy could provide a permanent fix. (Spark claimed the ticker symbol \u201cONCE\u201d when it went public early this year.) But some academic groups that tried a similar RPE65 gene therapy reported earlier this year that the effect wore off after one or more years. In the new trial, the treatment did not achieve one of the secondary goals \u2014 improving visual acuity, as measured by reading letters on an eye chart, by a statistically significant amount. Dr. Julia A. Haller, ophthalmologist in chief at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and president of the Retina Society, said that visual acuity was \u201cnot an endpoint that would be expected to improve dramatically,\u201d because the therapy was aimed at night vision and peripheral vision. Dr. Haller, who was an unpaid consultant in the trial, said the presentation of data from the trial would be the \u201chottest thing\u201d on the program at the Retina Society\u2019s annual meeting in Paris this weekend. \u201cTo get to this point, for this to come to fruition, is huge,\u201d she said. The therapy was originally developed by Dr. High and her colleagues at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. She co-founded Spark in 2013. In a somewhat unusual move, the hospital invested more than $30 million to help the company get started. The hospital now owns more than a third of the company, a stake worth close to $400 million.

{"Headline": "U.S. Announces Plans to Combat Illegal Fishing and Other Steps to Protect Oceans", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdministration officials also said they intended to expand the use of satellites that track illegal activity by detecting night lights used by fishermen to attract fish, and committed to better track all seafood that enters American ports.Chilean officials said they intended to cordon off more than 200,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean near Easter Island from commercial fishing and oil and gas exploration.Emphasizing the urgency of the crisis, Secretary of State John Kerry told the conference that the sea was acidifying 10 times faster than at any other point in history, and that one-third of the world\u2019s fish stocks were overexploited.\u201cThere\u2019s a direct line between black-market fishing, black-market drugs, smuggling and human trafficking,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cAnd people need to focus in on that intently.\u201dIn interviews last month and on Monday, Mr. Kerry elaborated on the administration\u2019s vision for better protecting the oceans. Pointing out that at least $10 billion is lost globally each year because of illegal fishing, Mr. Kerry said countries had to do more to police their waters. The biggest challenge to protecting the world\u2019s oceans, he said, is not writing new rules or declaring new areas off-limits to commercial activity, but enforcement.As an example, he cited the case of the Thunder, a ship that had topped Interpol\u2019s most-wanted list for more than $60 million worth of illegal fishing.The chase ended in April when the ship sank, possibly on purpose to dispose of evidence, in the waters off the West African island state of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. The ship\u2019s captain and two crew members, who have been detained in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe since the sinking, have been tried for environmental and maritime crimes. A verdict in the case is expected this week.In this series on lawlessness on the high seas, Ian Urbina reveals that crime and violence in international waters often goes unpunished.The Thunder\u2019s prime catch was toothfish, more popularly called Chilean sea bass, known on docks as \u201cwhite gold\u201d because its fillets often sell for $30 a plate or more in upscale restaurants in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re a tiny country with huge waters around us and limited resources,\u201d said Frederique Samba Viegas D\u2019Abreu, the attorney general of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, adding that this case was among the most expensive in his country\u2019s history.In late September, another toothfish vessel that had been wanted by Interpol, chased by Sea Shepherd and detained in Thailand escaped port and disappeared on the high seas. Thai port authorities say they are investigating how the ship got away and what sort of crew was aboard.Mr. Kerry said he hoped to see the House move forward with the measure, which, he said, has been bogged down by questions over whether it would put American fishermen at a disadvantage if the United States were to enforce it while other nations did not.Mr. Stumberg analyzed $300 million worth of American government purchases of fishery products, including frozen shrimp, canned tuna and livestock feed, which he said were most likely to be produced by slave labor. The biggest barrier to determining which federal contracts are most directly tied to sea slaves, he said, is the lack of specificity in the federal database.Mr. Kerry said he hoped to broaden oversight of seafood as it enters American ports to account not just for environmental crimes but labor concerns too. Port or fishery authorities responsible for reviewing imported seafood need to have not only \u201can understanding of the fishing chain, but also some sort of sign off or seal of approval as to what the conditions were in which it was fished,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slide in Manufacturing Continued in China Last Month", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s sprawling manufacturing sector continued to shrink in September, data released on Thursday showed, despite strength in service industries.Yet some economists said that because of unprecedented government spending, monetary stimulus and a growing services sector, China\u2019s economy as a whole might be more resilient than it seems at first glance.\u201cAll this talk about this impending crisis just seems so far off the mark, when you look at these indicators,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist following China at Capital Economics.Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets were closed on Thursday for a holiday, but other Asia markets were up. And that momentum carried over to European stocks, which opened strongly higher \u2014 despite new manufacturing data indicating only slow growth in the eurozone and signs of a potential slowdown in Britain. By mid-afternoon in Europe, though, stocks indexes were flat or only slight up for the day.For China, manufacturing output, as measured by the official purchasing managers index, was 49.8 in September, compared with a reading of 49.7 in August. The official nonmanufacturing survey result was 53.4, unchanged from August. The survey measures the change in conditions from the previous month; readings below 50 signal contraction.The results of another survey, compiled by Caixin, a Chinese financial news company, and Markit, an economic data provider, suggested a worse picture. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index, also released on Thursday, was 47.2 in September, down slightly from 47.3 in August and the lowest reading since the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009.China\u2019s economic growth has been battered in recent months by a fall in housing construction. That has led to a huge surplus in materials like steel and cement, which has idled plants or caused them to operate at a loss.\u201cThe industry has reached a crucial stage in its structural transformation,\u201d He Fan, the chief economist at the Caixin Insight Group, said in a news release accompanying the data. \u201cTepid demand is a main factor behind the oversupply of manufacturing and why it has not recovered.\u201dAt the same time, lackluster demand in crucial export markets in Asia and the West, and broader slumps in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Turkey, have weighed further on China\u2019s economy.On Monday, official figures showed profits at China\u2019s larger industrial companies fell 8.8 percent in August, compared with a year earlier, the biggest drop since the state statistics agency began releasing monthly data in 2011. Profit fell 22 percent at automakers and 72 percent at oil and natural gas companies.The statistics agency said that industrial profits had been reduced by China\u2019s surprise decision on Aug. 11 to devalue its currency, the renminbi, by the most in nearly two decades.That could benefit exporters, making China\u2019s goods relatively cheaper for overseas buyers. But it also makes imported materials more expensive for Chinese industries. The subindex for new export orders edged up 0.2 to 47.9, but activity was still shrinking over all.European manufacturers, which count on China as a big export market, are generally holding steady at low-level growth, according to the purchasing managers index published on Thursday by Markit. With some variations among the 19 eurozone countries, the overall index remained at 52 \u2014 still slightly in the growth range.But manufacturing activity in Britain, which has been Europe\u2019s fastest-growing economy, dipped to a three-month low, according to Markit, registering a 51.5 reading for September, compared with 51.6 the previous month.In China\u2019s case, although questions about the country\u2019s economic data are not new, many economists now doubt that the country will be able to reach its official target for economic growth of 7 percent this year. Official data did, however, show that rate being achieved in the first six months of the year.Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said there were reasons to hope for a better outlook, especially if the government eased monetary policy again this year. Mr. Liu said he expected growth in gross domestic product to improve slightly toward the end of the year, despite the gloomy manufacturing data.\u201cThe authorities will definitely miss a 7 percent growth, but we may not miss that target by a great margin,\u201d he said.Officials had hoped that consumer demand and the rise of a vibrant services sector would help offset the industrial slowdown and become the economy\u2019s main engines of growth.Both purchasing managers index surveys released on Thursday showed that the services sector continued to expand in September, but that growth, too, faced pressures. The Caixin services purchasing managers index reading, released alongside official data, was 50.5, down from 51.5 in August and at a 14-month low.\u201cIf you look at manufacturing sectors associated with consumption and services, their profitability remains quite healthy,\u201d Mr. Liu said.He pointed to profits in the food processing, education and recreation industries as evidence that services were strong, though not enough to counter the weakness in manufacturing.Mr. Evans-Pritchard agreed that the services figures were a sign of resilience in the economy.\u201cPeople have been talking about the need to rebalance towards consumption. There\u2019s a tendency to focus on industry data, but it is worth mentioning that those are no longer the key driver,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the growth is coming from consumption.\u201dMarkit\u2019s eurozone purchasing managers index, also released on Thursday, showed manufacturing slowing its pace of expansion. The index for September was 52, below the 52.3 reading in August. It has been above 50 for more than two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Environmentalists Praise Wildlife Measures in Trans-Pacific Trade Pact", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Environmentalists praised wildlife protections included in the sweeping Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal announced Monday, calling them groundbreaking.They said the pact would strengthen international environmental enforcement agreements and could go a long way toward diminishing the illegal trade in certain plants and animals.Those measures represent a major breakthrough on one of the most divisive issues in the contentious trade negotiations, as well as a significant victory for the Obama administration, which had pushed for strong environmental provisions against the objections of most other countries involved in the 12-nation deal.\u201cThe provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership go beyond what we have seen in other trade agreements,\u201d said David McCauley, senior vice president for policy and government affairs at the World Wildlife Fund, which was among several advocacy groups that had worked closely with the administration on the final language. \u201cWe see this as a very big deal.\u201dIn particular, the draft showed that Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, had pushed for but failed to achieve a requirement that the pact\u2019s signers abide by existing environmental treaties, which have few enforcement provisions.But the final deal includes that requirement, along with new enforcement methods. It also places new limits on wildlife trafficking and subsidies for illegal fishing.The United States and several of the Asian countries participating in the trade deal are sources of and crucial markets for illegal animal parts like African rhinoceros horns, ivory and tiger bones. In Asia, some exotic animal parts end up as meals or in medicine shops, where they are sold as cures for various ailments including impotence. In Western countries, some smuggled items, like lion heads, end up in living rooms as trophies.Worldwide, the illegal trade is estimated at about $20 billion a year by Interpol, the international police agency.Under provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, countries would be required to enforce laws and regulations to protect wildlife covered under the Cites agreement from illegal smuggling, or risk economic sanctions.The agreement goes further by requiring countries to take action to protect any wildlife, even if it is not covered under Cites, if the wildlife has been illegally taken from any country.United States law enforcement officials say that smugglers have often considered themselves safe from prosecution after their goods left the countries of origin, because the destination countries typically did not pursue investigations.By contrast, the wildlife provisions of the trade agreement require cooperation among law enforcement agencies across international borders and require that the agencies share information to help investigate international criminal gangs involved in wildlife trafficking.The agreement also has what some environmental groups and trade officials call historic measures to protect against overfishing, which causes losses estimated at $10 billion to $23 billion a year because of depleted stocks.Under the agreement, countries would agree to prohibit some subsidies that they provide to their fishing fleets. United States trade officials said the measure was a major concession for several countries that have large fishing industries.Environmental advocacy groups, while praising the wildlife language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, said that the impact would be only as good as participants\u2019 willingness to enforce it.\u201cThere has to be vigilance in monitoring the agreements and making sure that countries live up to their end of the bargain,\u201d said Glenn Prickett, chief external affairs officer for the Nature Conservancy.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an environmental organization that worked with the Obama administration on the environmental chapter of the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership trade agreement. It is the World Wildlife Fund, not the World Wildlife Federation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Risky Strategy Sinks Small Hedge Fund", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an upstart hedge fund that pitched large returns in periods of market turbulence by relying on a complex and controversial trading strategy.At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, investors would have had a gain of more than 600 percent, according to projections in investor documents for the new hedge fund, Spruce Alpha.But when markets again turned volatile this August, Spruce Alpha, which had started in April 2014, failed to turn the turmoil to its advantage. For that month \u2014 a particularly difficult period for many money managers \u2014 Spruce Alpha fared worse than most, losing investors 48 percent of their money, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.The under-$100 million fund, which was managed by the $1.5 billion Spruce Investment Advisors, has for now moved its positions into cash, said a person briefed on the fund. The fund has told investors that they can redeem what remains of their money.Spruce Alpha\u2019s woes are a black eye for Spruce Investment, the 14-year-old Stamford, Conn., firm led by John C. Bailey, who previously worked at an asset management firm that was once owned by the bond giant Pimco.Spruce Investment specializes in managing money for the wealthy and institutional investors like the Hamlin School, a private all-girls school in San Francisco, which did not invest in the hedge fund. Roughly half the money that Spruce Investment manages belongs to three family offices, a corporation and a pension plan.The Alpha fund was the asset management firm\u2019s first foray into direct hedge fund trading. The firm said it had planned to raise as much as $500 million for the portfolio.To sell the fledgling fund to investors, Spruce emphasized not only an outsize hypothetical performance going back as far as 2006 \u2014 but also that one of its top managers, Robert Stock, was a former researcher who had worked on simulations of laser defense missiles.In April, Mr. Stock left the firm. Several other top executives have also left Spruce Investment this year.The implosion in Spruce Alpha is unlikely to make waves in the more than $3 trillion hedge fund industry. For the investors who have lost nearly half of their investment, however, it is a cautionary tale of relying on glowing, but backdated, performance data.Back-tested results in hedge fund marketing materials have long drawn scorn from some in the hedge fund world. The results are typically recreated with the benefit of hindsight, making it easier for a fund to post hypothetical good results.Norman Kilarjian, a partner with Aksia, a hedge fund advisory firm to institutional investors, said individual investors should not put great credence into back-tested results in hedge fund marketing material because the results are derived assuming optimum trading conditions.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a back-test that didn\u2019t look fantastic, but investors are often falling for it,\u201d he said, not commenting on any specific hedge fund.It is not clear exactly what caused the big losses in August. Spruce Alpha used a sophisticated strategy that involved derivatives to amplify returns from trading in exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, of various strategies. The strategy seeks to make money off the volatility in the stock market.E.T.F.s are securities that hold a portfolio of stocks and trade shares throughout the day. At first, these securities mostly just mirrored the holdings of major stock indexes, but they have since grown increasingly complex, with some relying on derivatives to amplify returns.In 2009, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warned about the risks of investing in the strategy. \u201cInvestors should be aware that performance of these E.T.F.s over a period longer than one day can differ significantly from their stated performance objectives,\u201d the regulators said in an investor alert.The back-tested results for the Spruce Alpha fund may not have taken into account how markets and investors would react given the kind of circumstances that took place in August. The hypothetical results could have underestimated the fact that some E.T.F.s are used as trading instruments that big money managers move quickly in and out of in times of extreme market volatility.In a disclaimer to its marketing materials, Spruce Alpha also noted some of the unreliability of back-tested returns. The hypothetical results \u201cdo not represent the results of actual trading\u201d and \u201cwere achieved by means of the retroactive application of a hypothetical model that was designed with the benefit of hindsight and could be adjusted at will until desired or better performance results were achieved,\u201d the disclaimer reads.The tests had apparently not simulated a situation like Aug. 24, when some E.T.F.s seized up in the first few minutes at the start of trading. But a handful of nimble managers still managed to excel, some even maintaining double-digit returns for the year at the end of the month.Todd Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. research for Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ, said leveraged E.T.F.s were an inherently risky strategy that is more akin to \u201cgambling than investing\u201d and should be viewed as purely a trading strategy.Mr. Rosenbluth said he was not surprised by Spruce Alpha\u2019s poor performance in August because it used a strategy that tends to perform best when markets are volatile in one direction as opposed to the big up and down swings in stock prices seen in August.\u201cIt\u2019s investing on steroids, and there can be benefits to taking on leverage, but it is easy to get hurt and even easier to get hurt when the markets react differently than you expect,\u201d Mr. Rosenbluth said.The person briefed on the Spruce Alpha fund said the August losses were the result of unprecedented upheaval in the history of the VIX, an index that measures volatility in the market.Mr. Bailey of Spruce Investment did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Stock said the Alpha fund\u2019s poor performance in August was a mystery to him. He noted that the hedge fund had posted strong returns early this year.\u201cThere is so much that goes into the strategy that it\u2019s hard to encapsulate it,\u201d Mr. Stock said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a multitude of ways one could picture implementing this strategy,\u201d he said, adding that sizing of positions, risk management and choosing the right E.T.F.s were all factors that contribute to the success or failure of the strategy.Referring to the Alpha fund\u2019s August performance, Mr. Stock added: \u201cI have trouble understanding the kind of performance they got.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Rule Adds a Layer of Protection to Swaps Trades", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRisky practices on Wall Street allowed the American International Group to place the dangerous trades that nearly took down the financial system in 2008.Now, seven years later, federal regulators are passing a rule that aims to end customs that helped A.I.G. bet the house.The rule focuses on the enormous market for swaps \u2014 the financial contracts that banks and investors use to hedge risks and make wagers. The new regulations seek to strengthen this market by requiring users of certain swaps to undergird their trades with financial collateral like cash or government bonds. Financial firms already post collateral, also called margin, on many of their trades. But this does not happen at the outset of a trade on a great many swaps, particularly those between the large Wall Street banks that dominate the swaps market.The effect of the swaps margin rule will be felt most keenly on Wall Street, where swaps trading is generally more profitable than trading in stocks and bonds.Now, big swaps dealers, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, will have to post margin to one another as soon as they enter a trade, rather than only when a trade progresses and causes a loss to one side.Using cash and other forms of collateral for the new margin requirements could be costly for the dealers. Still, the threat of such a cost may prompt the banks to streamline their swaps trading substantially, thus dampening any cost from posting more collateral.\u201cWe welcome the F.D.I.C.\u2019s approval of its final rule on margin requirements,\u201d said Mary Johannes, a senior director at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents participants in the swaps market. But Ms. Johannes added that adapting to the rule before next September would be \u201cchallenging, particularly as regulators in other jurisdictions have not yet published final rules, and harmonization across jurisdictions is not yet clear.\u201dThe swaps margin rule being approved by federal regulators applies to trades that take place directly between institutions.The Dodd-Frank Act, which Congress passed in 2010 to overhaul the financial system, sought to shrink these direct trades. The concern was that banks might set weak standards for certain big swaps customers, causing a precarious buildup of risks in a market that is quite opaque. In the lead-up to its near collapse, Wall Street banks exempted A.I.G. from posting much margin. When losses grew on A.I.G.\u2019s trades, and A.I.G. was struggling to make its margin payments, the banks were exposed to potentially huge losses. In the end, the taxpayer bailout was needed to funnel payments to the banks that A.I.G. could not make on its swaps.Seeing the dangers of swaps struck directly between financial institutions, Congress also sought to reduce the amount of direct swaps and instead force firms to route their swaps through clearinghouses. In theory, clearinghouses make the swaps market safer because they collect standardized amounts of margin from all their customers on all the trades they handle.To help ensure that more trades go through clearinghouses, the swaps margin rule currently being approved in effect sets margin on direct trades at a higher level than what is required by clearinghouses. On a conference call with reporters, a federal banking official estimated that margin on direct trades might turn out to be 30 percent higher than trades going through clearinghouses.There was some disagreement around one part of the swaps margin rule.Units within a single bank often do large amounts of swaps trades with one another. Although there would seem to be little need for units within the same bank to post collateral to one another because they belong to the same entity, there was a concern about these internal trades. Some specialists feared that the main deposit-taking subsidiary of a bank, which benefits from taxpayer-backed deposit insurance, was taking on the risk of its swaps dealing affiliates. To help address this, Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman of the F.D.I.C., said in July that entities on either side of an internal bank trade should post margin to each other.The final rule did not go that far. Instead, it requires a \u201ccovered swaps entity\u201d of a bank to collect margin from an affiliate at the outset of a trade. But it would not have to post margin to that affiliate at the start of a trade. \u201cWhile the system over all would have been best served if banks posted as well as collected margin with their affiliates,\u201d Mr. Hoenig said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cmuch is accomplished with the requirement that the insured bank collect margin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Glencore Isn\u2019t Out of the Woods Yet", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Shares of Glencore, the giant Swiss-based mining and trading company, may have recovered from a panic sell-off this week, but few analysts consider the company out of danger.Glencore still has a heavy debt load, and investors remained worried about global economic trends and some management missteps. And the slowing Chinese economy is hurting demand for many of the commodities, like copper, that the company not only mines but also heavily trades.\u201cThere is clearly a very strong degree of fear in the market more broadly associated with China,\u201d said Paul Gait, a mining analyst at Bernstein Research in London.Until recently, though, the company\u2019s management, led by Ivan Glasenberg, seemed reluctant to acknowledge the severity of the situation.The company announced on Aug. 19 that it had lost $676 million for the first half of the year, compared with a profit of $1.7 billion for the period a year earlier. But Mr. Glasenberg tried to soothe concerns, writing in a letter to shareholders that commodity prices \u201cappear driven increasingly by perceptions and technical factors rather than reality or fundamentals.\u201dIn response, investors and analysts began asking whether the company would be able to continue servicing its heavy debt, which the company said was $30 billion at the end of the first half of 2015. The company does not include $17 billion in trading inventories in that figure, an omission that may be further spooking investors.Fears that Glencore cannot meet its debt obligations evidently helped lead to the steep drop on Monday, when the shares fell 29 percent in a single trading day. The company reacted on Tuesday with a statement saying that its business was \u201coperationally and financially robust\u201d and had \u201cabsolutely no solvency issues.\u201dBy Thursday, after first being sharply higher, shares closed down 0.58 percent for the day. That left them down about 6.2 percent for the week.While Mr. Gait and some other analysts doubt that Glencore is on the verge of being unable to pay its debt, analysts say the company will probably be under pressure until it convinces investors that it has taken steps to address their concerns.\u201cDownside risk will likely continue to dominate\u201d the company\u2019s shares \u201cuntil it can reinforce its capital base,\u201d wrote Dominic O\u2019Kane, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Cazenove in London.Glencore\u2019s origins are the trading operations of Marc Rich, the trader who fled to Switzerland to avoid tax evasion charges in the United States. He was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. Mr. Glasenberg and a group of associates bought out the business in the early 1990s and took it public in 2011.Mr. Glasenberg, who owns more than 8 percent of the stock, has built the company into a global behemoth with 181,000 employees and contractors.Based in Baar, Switzerland, Glencore has an unusual combination of businesses. The company is a major metal producer with mines in Zambia, Australia, Chile and elsewhere, and oil production in Equatorial Guinea and Chad. It is also a leading trading firm, moving oil and other commodities around the world and parking them in a vast network of storage tanks and warehouses.Glencore argues that this combination of businesses gives it a unique insight into markets. While the company appears to have been caught off guard by this year\u2019s drop in commodity prices, the trading arm, in theory, should be a more stable business during that downturn by being able to hedge against price fluctuations.\u201cThe absolute price level is not that relevant for a trading business,\u201d said Roland Rechtsteiner, a Zurich-based partner at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Mr. Rechtsteiner said the volatility of prices and the ability to arbitrage between different geographic areas were more important for trading profits.That held true in the year\u2019s first half, when Glencore\u2019s overall earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation from trading fell by about 27 percent, to $1.2 billion. But the company\u2019s energy trading profits more than doubled to $479 million, as Glencore was able to navigate the turbulent oil market.A key building block for Glencore was the $30 billion takeover of the miner Xstrata in 2013, which was one of the world\u2019s biggest coal extractors and exporters, but also big in copper and other metals.That deal so far has looked poorly timed. Mr. Glasenberg paid in shares, but Xstrata brought a pile of debt along with its mines. And since then coal prices have declined, not only because of the general commodities downdraft but because coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels, is falling from favor.And the price of copper, which is the biggest contributor to Glencore\u2019s operating income, at about 30 percent, has also been falling, down about 18 percent this year.Analysts at Goldman Sachs have forecast that copper, now about $5,000 per metric ton, might fall to $4,500 by the end of next year.That is one reason Glencore has at least temporarily closed some of its copper mines in Africa, shutting down the Katanga mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Mopani mine in Zambia.The company is now moving fast to cut its debt load. In September, it placed $2.5 billion in shares; Mr. Glasenberg and other employees took 22 percent of the offer. The company has also suspended its dividend, saying it plans to sell $2 billion in assets.Some analysts say that those moves, though not small, are not enough. As a miner and trader of commodities whose prices still may not have found their bottom, Glencore is too dependent on forces not completely in its control.How Glencore fares, Mr. O\u2019Kane of J.P. Morgan wrote, may \u201chinge on small changes in commodity prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In 3rd Quarter, Investors Rode the Rapids After Stocks Plunged", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA long stretch of unusual calm in the stock market gave way to a succession of violent swings in the third quarter as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at last and then were disappointed \u2014 after the briefest spurt of euphoria \u2014 when the Fed demurred.The net result was the worst quarter in four years, and some strategists predicted further trouble ahead.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t end happily,\u201d said Komal S. Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. \u201c2016 looks like a volatile and pretty difficult year for markets in the United States and around the globe.\u201dIt was certainly a difficult quarter. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 6.9 percent in the three months through September, closing at 1,920, roughly where the benchmark stood in May of last year.The decline was part of a broader trend toward shunning the risky assets that had been coveted for six-plus years. High-yield bonds fell, as did many commodities.Treasury prices rose as their yields fell during the quarter, with the return on the benchmark 10-year note dropping to 2.04 percent from 2.35 percent at the end of the previous quarter. Treasuries are often a safe harbor during turbulent market conditions, and with the Fed maintaining its target for short-term rates at zero to 0.25 percent, as it has for nearly a decade, traders saw no reason to expect the outlook for long-term rates to change anytime soon.If Wall Street seems unwilling to take yes for an answer, investment advisers say, it\u2019s because the Fed\u2019s welcome caution in raising rates is more than offset by the fact that the Fed sees so much to be cautious about.\u201cThe market didn\u2019t expect a rate hike, and it didn\u2019t get one,\u201d said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust. \u201cThe problem is the tone of the minutes and press conference that suggested the Fed is worried more about the global growth outlook than previously. That\u2019s really spooking the market.\u201dLaird R. Landmann, co-head of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, agreed that central bankers were unnerving investors and suggested that they might have given themselves the jitters, too.\u201cThere\u2019s a mind-set that has developed at the Fed where they\u2019re waiting for a perfect moment that never comes,\u201d he said.With or without the Fed\u2019s help, enough happened in the third quarter to leave owners of stock funds feeling a bit twitchy. The average domestic portfolio fell 7.8 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by specialists in energy and other natural resources, communications and technology.\u201cThere are yellow lights flashing out there in terms of the global economy, but there\u2019s no deterioration in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Stephen E. Kylander, manager of the RBC Mid Cap Value fund.That should be good news for small and medium-size companies. They depend on foreign markets for a smaller proportion of their sales than big companies do, but they benefit just as much from lower interest rates. Yet mid- and small-capitalization funds underperformed in the third quarter: Midcap portfolios lost 9.4 percent and small caps lost 10.8 percent.One reason for the weakness, Mr. Kylander said, is that while smaller companies tend to have a domestic focus, many would like to gain a foothold overseas and cannot.But he sees value in market segments that offer decent dividend income, like utilities and commercial real estate investment trusts, and in domestically focused industries like trucking.Shareholders in international stock funds used the third quarter mainly as an opportunity to sell, driving the average one down 10 percent. Europe displayed newfound stability over the summer as Greece ceased to be an urgent problem for the moment, but that was more than offset by deteriorating conditions in emerging markets. Funds that specialize in Latin America, Asia and diversified emerging markets had average losses of 12.8 percent or more.Chinese stocks had an awful quarter; funds that focus on the country plunged 20.9 percent. The economic malaise there continued and may have contributed to the decline in American stocks and the limited relief experienced when the Fed stood pat.China is a huge exporter, and with the decline in the renminbi it has begun to export deflation to other developing countries, forcing them into a difficult, maybe hopeless, position. If they weaken their currencies to match the renminbi devaluation, the burden of their immense dollar-denominated debt will grow when expressed in their own currencies. If they keep their currencies relatively strong, however, their exports will become less competitive.\u201cThere is no room for them to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. He expects the developing countries to devalue, even if it leads to credit downgrades, defaults and difficulty in refinancing debt for corporate and government borrowers.\u201cThey will have to go through with it to have fewer negative effects on competitiveness,\u201d he predicted.It\u2019s a no-win situation. Mr. Sri-Kumar noted that emerging markets accounted for more than half of global economic output. They\u2019re not the small, exotic growth stories of 10 or 20 years ago.If those countries slow because of this crisis, \u201ceventually it\u2019s going to reverberate back to the United States,\u201d he said.Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted a year ago that the Fed would hold rates steady this year, and fragility in the developing world has persuaded him to extend his forecast through 2016. That could leave the stock market in a bad spot, in his view, as investors, desensitized to the putative benefits of ultra-easy monetary policy after nearly a decade, sell into any short-lived rally after the Fed postpones a rate increase, as it did last month.He recommends sheltering in high-quality bonds and blue-chip stocks that pay generous dividends.Nothing goes down forever. At some point, perhaps in the first quarter, emerging stock markets will be cheap enough to present a low-risk buying opportunity, he said.Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, expects a shorter wait for the Fed to move.\u201cThe Fed is still looking at raising interest rates at some point in the coming months,\u201d she said.Ms. Patterson encourages investors to have a relatively heavy allocation in American stocks while they wait, particularly in financial services and consumer discretionary companies, and remain light in emerging markets and energy. She would also be comparatively light in bonds, although she finds mortgage-backed securities to be sound bets, she said, because they are less sensitive to rising rates and she detects consistent improvement in the housing market.Ms. Nixon at Northern Trust has a similar view of American and emerging markets: heavy in the first, light in the second. She also advocates a more modest than usual bond allocation. As for the Fed, it \u201cwants to get off the zero,\u201d she said, but \u201cthe job isn\u2019t going to get any easier\u201d given the global backdrop. So \u201cif the Fed hikes, it may be one and done,\u201d she said.Mr. Landmann at TCW contends that the Fed is content to keep rates where they are.\u201cThey\u2019re looking for reasons not to tighten,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, at any given meeting coming up, that we have more than a 50-50 chance of tightening if things stay as they are.\u201dBut with rates so low, Mr. Landmann cautioned, if conditions deteriorate in China and elsewhere and begin to weigh more heavily on the American economy and markets, there will be little the Fed can do. For six years, investors have bought stocks after declines. Now might be a good time to sell after rallies, he advised.\u201cIf you\u2019re a conservative, value-oriented investor, when prices go up you want to use it as an opportunity to take risk out of your portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cAsset prices can\u2019t stay high forever. There may be decent returns for the next quarter as the Fed stays on hold, but even that won\u2019t work after a while. The rest of the world may take matters into their own hands. It may not matter what the Fed does.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Chief Defends Investments in Labor, Stores and the Web", "Date": "2015-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is the consummate Walmart company man.\u201cThe reaction by the market \u2014 while not what we\u2019d hoped \u2014 was not entirely surprising,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese investments are critical to our current and future success as a company. Simply put, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dThe problems encountered by Walmart did not appear overnight, nor will a solution. The company that once redefined the retail landscape with its cavernous warehouselike stores that sold thousands of items at a discount \u2014 pushing small mom-and-pop stores across the country out of business \u2014 now finds itself facing formidable rivals in the digital-shopping arena.Moreover, its costs are climbing sharply higher at a time when sales are flat. Its stock is down 30 percent so far this year. This month, it laid off nearly 500 employees from its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.With more than $485 billion in annual revenue (just a bit behind the entire economy of Norway), 5,000 stores and clubs scattered around the world and 1.4 million \u201cassociates\u201d (employees), Walmart is still the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable retailer by far. But its size also makes changing course akin to turning around an ocean liner in a swimming pool.Among some of the needle-moving maneuvers being hotly debated among Wall Street analysts is whether the company should spin off its lower-margin Sam\u2019s Club unit, exit challenging overseas markets or buy an e-commerce player.Those decisions and many more are in the hands of Mr. McMillon, a 49-year-old whose family moved to Bentonville when he was a teenager.While Mr. McMillon was handpicked by the Walton family and is steeped in the Southern conservative stances, traditions and history of the company, his appointment, nonetheless, has represented a generational, cultural and societal shift within the retailer.In the last year, Walmart has stopped selling Confederate-flag merchandise as well as assault rifles, has publicly supported gay rights and, after years of criticism, has raised its minimum starting wage to $9 an hour.Now, progressives may be cheering, but Wall Street is not. Investors fear that Walmart\u2019s heavy investments in labor, in the Internet and in discounts will weigh on the retailer\u2019s short-term earnings \u2014 and many are running the other way.\u201cWalmart expects a return from these wagers,\u201d Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS, wrote in a note. Still, \u201cit\u2019s unclear if its investment of $1.5 billion in labor and \u2018several billion dollars\u2019 in pricing will push it ahead of others, or just keep pace.\u201dWalmart would have an easier time if it were not under siege from multiple directions.Membership-only warehouse clubs like Costco and hard discounters like Aldi are eating away at Walmart\u2019s price-competitive edge. Hectic lifestyles are driving shoppers to smaller and more convenient dollar stores \u2014 even pharmacies \u2014 for groceries. Amazon and its vast online catalog, and the advent of seemingly every product imaginable at shoppers\u2019 fingertips, is neutralizing the advantage of Walmart\u2019s supercenter-size assortment.But despite declaring a decade and a half ago, in 1999, that it was determined to take on the web, Walmart has stumbled in its attempts to dominate online as it had brick-and-mortar. In the company\u2019s critical early days online, its insular culture helped drive away a celebrated e-commerce guru. It has been slow to roll out an online grocery store.Last year, Amazon sold almost $90 billion worth of products online, compared with just $12.2 billion Walmart sold through its website. E-commerce still makes up only about 2.5 percent of Walmart\u2019s annual sales, and its growth online is slowing. Its peers, however, have hardly done better; Target, for example, gets about 2.8 percent of its sales through its website.Walmart has promised to marry its fledgling web operations with its brick-and-mortar footprint of more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club locations in the United States, allowing customers all manner of options: online ordering, in-store pickup, curbside pickup and home delivery.But the retailer\u2019s transition to a multichannel operator \u201cis costing more and lasting longer than expected,\u201d said Simeon Gutman, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cNot sure it\u2019s the last time we\u2019ll be saying this.\u201dBut for some, it is not surprising that Walmart faces an uncertain future as the middle class is struggling. Though the job market is picking up, wages and income have grown slowly, especially for the typical Walmart shopper with an annual household income of just over $53,000, according to a survey conducted last year by Kantar Retail, a consulting firm based in London. Kantar found that Target\u2019s shoppers tended to make about $12,000 more annually.Paradoxically, labor groups say that Walmart, as the nation\u2019s largest private employer, shares the blame for America\u2019s ailing middle class. And they say that while it is a step forward for Walmart to increase the pay of its most poorly paid workers, the raise \u2014 to at least $9 this year and $10 next year \u2014 is not nearly enough.For the company to attribute its recent woes to higher wages for its workers is gratuitous, said Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Making Change at Walmart, a campaign to improve working conditions at Walmart backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers union.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to blame a large profit drop on a $1 billion wage increase,\u201d Ms. Levin said. \u201cIf you look at what $1 billion means to Walmart, it\u2019s a very small fraction of their annual U.S. sales. If they had moved the needle at all on sales, this is a conversation we wouldn\u2019t be having in the first place.\u201dAfter falling short of a number of performance goals, Mr. McMillon saw his own compensation shrink 24 percent to $19.4 million last year.Mr. McMillon and his wife, Shelley, live in a house that sits on nearly 100 acres in north Bentonville, according to county assessor records.

{"Headline": "Pandora Shares Plummet as Competition Grows", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Friday, a more telling yardstick emerged as a measurement for Apple\u2019s success: Pandora Media\u2019s stock price.Shares in Pandora, the Internet radio service, fell by 35 percent in one day, wiping away $1.4 billion in the company\u2019s market value. The stock closed at $12.39, its lowest price in more than two years.\u201cThe fear from the investor world is that there is going to be a continued battle to fight for users,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, \u201cand that will depress what is already is not much cash flow even further.\u201dBut Pandora also downgraded its financial guidance for the rest of the year on Thursday, saying that it now expected its adjusted earnings to be in the range of $51 million to $56 million, down from the $75 million to $85 million it had predicted three months before. Its expected revenue for the year was lowered by about 2 percent, to a range of $1.153 billion to $1.158 billion.Those revised figures suggested a shrinking ability by Pandora to make money from its listeners, and some analysts reacted with alarm.\u201cWe are shocked by guidance implying monetization is hitting a wall,\u201d wrote Robert S. Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, in a research report that decreased his company\u2019s price target for Pandora to $18 a share, from $25.In another report, Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets wrote, \u201cWe expected a modest impact from the Apple Music launch, but it turned out to be more fundamentally challenging than we thought.\u201dPandora declined to comment.Pandora has long been the largest Internet radio outlet in terms of users, and it has withstood challenges before, including the introduction of Apple\u2019s iTunes Radio in 2013. Pandora, which makes about 80 percent of its revenue from advertising, has steadily increased the amount of money it makes from each listener. For the third quarter, the company\u2019s revenue per thousand listening hours was $60.52, its highest, according to Mr. McAndrews.But after years of steady growth, Pandora\u2019s lead has begun to erode. It number of active users \u2014 those who tune in to the service at least once a month \u2014 peaked at 81.5 million at the end of last year, and in its third quarter fell to 78.1 million.At the same time, it is spending more to attract those listeners. Pandora\u2019s sales and marketing expenses grew by 48 percent in its third quarter, compared with the same period last year, and in the conference call on Thursday, Michael S. Herring, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that its marketing budget would increase further next year.The issue of competition has intensified as digital music services proliferate and their features overlap. Services like Spotify, Apple Music, Rdio and Google Play let users pick exactly what song to listen to, but also have radiolike features similar to Pandora, letting users listen passively by feeding them songs tailored to their tastes.\u201cHistorically, Pandora\u2019s marketing was viral; it marketed itself,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cNow because there is so much competition, to generate the same level of revenue, they have to spend more to get there.\u201dInvestors have also long been concerned about the cost of music licenses. That cost has gradually declined. But in its third-quarter report, Pandora revealed two significant expenditures.The company said that it had reached a $90 million settlement with the major record labels on royalties for songs from before 1972, an issue that has caused uncertainty for many companies. Pandora also said it was taking a $23.9 million charge for songwriting royalties.One of Pandora\u2019s biggest costs will be set when the Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of federal judges, sets recording royalty rates for the next five years. A decision by the board is expected by the middle of December.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Flurry of Deals, the Beginning of the End?", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe first day of Wall Street\u2019s workweek normally comes with the announcement of a corporate merger or two, hence the nickname \u201cMerger Monday.\u201d But these days, a more appropriate moniker might be \u201cManic Monday.\u201dThere was more than $170 billion of deal-making unveiled on Monday. Dell agreed to acquire EMC, the storage provider, in a deal worth about $67 billion, and Anheuser-Busch InBev said it had raised its bid for SABMiller to about $103 billion. Add in a few smaller transactions and you have one of the biggest days ever in Wall Street deal-making. Mergers and acquisitions are on track for a record year. So far in 2015, there have been nearly $3.5 trillion worth of transactions, according to Thomson Reuters. One Wall Street banker described Monday as feeling \u201ca little bit like 1986 or maybe 2007.\u201d If that\u2019s right, these deals do not portend good things, and will likely represent the end \u2014 or at least the beginning of the end \u2014 of a bull market.That doesn\u2019t mean the market is going to falter tomorrow, or even in the coming months. If history is any guide, there is likely a year of more deal-making, and with interest rates likely to remain low, it is possible it could go on even longer. When Wall Street banks announce their earnings over the next two weeks, expect talk of an unusually long list of deals in the pipeline. But to many astute financial minds, this level of deal-making is unsustainable.In June, this column pointed out that the latest spate of deal-making was a sign of a weak economy. But these deals may underscore something graver: weak fundamentals. Consider what\u2019s behind Monday\u2019s announcements: businesses that are under siege and trying to transform themselves. In the case of Dell-EMC, Dell is trying to move away from its personal computer business while EMC has been struggling in the face of a changing environment for computer storage. According to my colleague Peter Eavis, Dell\u2019s private numbers reflect a net loss of $768 million, compared with a $570 million loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was also down, falling to $27.5 billion in the latest six months, from $29.5 billion in the year-earlier period. The deal may very well work \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s probably what both companies should be doing \u2014 but the transaction is hardly being struck from a position of strength.The same is true of the possible Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller tie-up. Market share has declined for both companies and sales have fallen in developed countries, where microbrews are stealing significant market share. The rationale for merging is very clear: cost-cutting.Both of these deals may turn out to be good for shareholders, but they both say a lot about what\u2019s driving the current round of mergers and perhaps more important, the larger economic forces at work. Big companies that have been cutting their way to profitability for the last several years have run out of costs to cut. So what do they do? Merge to cut costs even more.\u201cCorporate consolidation can perhaps provide some last drops of stock market intoxication,\u201d Spiros Malandrakis, an analyst at Euromonitor, wrote last month about the potential beer merger.If you were to lay the performance of the S.&P. 500 over a chart of deal volume over the last 30 years, you\u2019d see that deal-making is a lagging, not a forward-looking, indicator to the stock market. In other words, a rise in deal volume follows a rise in the stock market; it doesn\u2019t come ahead of it. Also, there is often a spike in deal-making in the year and a half before a major market correction. The biggest deals tend to happen at the end of a bull market cycle, like the 2007 leveraged buyout of the Texas utility TXU, which ended with a bankruptcy filing last year. Of course, deals would make more sense at the beginning of a cycle, but chief executives are usually too worried about their own businesses to take a large risk.Dell is certainly taking a big risk, as the deal for EMC will saddle it with $50 billion of debt. Meg Whitman, the chief of Hewlett-Packard, used the transaction\u2019s heavy leverage to take a jab at her rival. \u201cTo pay back the interest on the $50 billion of debt that the new combined company will have on their balance sheet, Dell will need to pay roughly $2.5 billion a year in interest alone,\u201d she wrote in a note to her employees. \u201cThat\u2019s $2.5 billion that they will allocate away from R.&D. and other business-critical activities, which will keep them from better serving their customers.\u201dThat might be true, but Moody\u2019s is actually planning to upgrade Dell\u2019s debt based on the deal, contending the numbers make sense: \u201cDespite the significant increase in debt and initial leverage, Dell\u2019s overall credit profile will be enhanced with the acquisition of EMC, a merger that will create the largest private technology company in the world based on revenues.\u201dSurely, the Dell-EMC deal and the potential beer combination are far more logical than pie-in-the-sky deals driven by illusory goals or fantastical synergy claims, such as the infamous AOL-Time Warner merger in 1999, widely considered the worst deal ever. We haven\u2019t seen anything that silly \u2014 yet. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solution Without a Problem? A Tax on High-Frequency Trading ", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket MoversThe odd thing about all this concern is that most of the investors who are actually facing off against the high-frequency traders \u2014 often on behalf of retirement savers \u2014 don\u2019t see this as anything like the most costly problem they are facing, even in the arcane realm of trading mechanics.The most commonly cited statistics suggest that high-frequency traders are making, at most, a few billion dollars a year in the stock markets. That take has been shrinking steadily in recent years, according to research from the Tabb Group, and is much smaller than what was captured by the old middlemen in the stock markets whom the high-speed traders largely replaced: the bank and brokerage employees on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.Brandon Becker, a former chief legal officer at the big mutual fund company TIAA-CREF, is someone no one could confuse for a high-frequency trader. But at an event earlier this year called to discuss potential fixes for the stock market, he said regulators should be spending less time worrying about stock markets and more time on problems like the cost of trading bonds, a market about twice as big in the United States as the one for stocks.\u201cIf I were looking to save money for investors, I would be looking at the fixed-income markets,\u201d Mr. Becker told the roundtable at the Securities and Exchange Commission, using the industry jargon for bonds. Another bigger problem area, he said, was the availability of \u201cretirement advice for people with less than a million dollars.\u201dIt is a curious phenomenon: the politicians calling for a crackdown on a problem in which the ostensible victims seem relatively unconcerned. One possible explanation is that the stock market and its occasional breakdowns are simply more visible \u2014 showing up on the news every night \u2014 even though Americans have more of their savings in other markets.Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research on trading costs is frequently cited by critics of high-frequency trading, said he has a hard time understanding why the issue had garnered such attention, particularly given his findings.\u201cThese guys barely make any money compared to the old specialists,\u201d Mr. Hendershott said, referring to the floor traders. \u201cI can tell you who I\u2019d rather trade with.\u201dMr. Hendershott said he thinks high-speed traders cause concern because they \u201cmake money in ways that people don\u2019t understand.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Hendershott and other market analysts say, other markets should be made to work more, not less, like the supposedly broken stock markets.In bond trading, for example, there are generally not exchanges where investors can check the most recent prices. Investors have to rely on their broker or bank to give them a fair price without having an easy way to determine what a fair price looks like. Not surprisingly, in this setup, the brokers and banks charge a lot for their services \u2014 often around 3 percent of the transaction price for municipal bonds, as compared with the few tenths of a percentage point that investors pay for a stock trade.None of this means that there aren\u2019t potential problems in need of fixing in the stock market.Even some high-frequency traders worry that the fragmented, automated nature of stock trading has made the markets more fragile and liable to disruptions like the so-called Flash Crash of 2010, when stock prices cratered in a matter of minutes for reasons having little to do with the value of the underlying stocks. After that crash, though, prices recovered quickly, and the same has happened after more recent market mishaps.There is also evidence that the presence of high-speed traders has made it more expensive for big investors trying to buy or sell multimillion dollar blocks of shares.David Lauer, a co-founder of the Healthy Markets Association \u2014 an advocacy group that has been critical of high-frequency traders \u2014 said that while the automation and race for speed in the stock market had generally been a good thing for ordinary investors, it had turned into an arms race with little societal benefit.But if the pendulum has swung too far in the stock market, Mr. Lauer said, \u201cthe pendulum hasn\u2019t even begun swinging in other markets.\u201dEven regulators have taken to complaining about how much time they are spending on the stock or equity market rather than on other topics that are costing investors more.As to what might happen if the trading tax that Mrs. Clinton proposed is enacted, perhaps the best indication comes from Canada, where a fee aimed at high-speed traders was put in place in 2012.An Upshot article on Tuesday about proposals to tax high-frequency trading misstated the given name of an executive as well as his place of employment. He is Brandon Becker, not Brendan, and he is no longer employed as chief legal officer at TIAA-CREF, having left that job last month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Financing Hits a Snag", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnly a few months ago, it seemed that the renewable energy sector could do little wrong: Stock prices were soaring and money was pouring in as investors flocked to get in on the action. That is no longer the case. Low oil and gas prices have roiled the energy markets, and the specter of rising interest rates has rattled investors\u2019 confidence in the industry\u2019s returns. Although energy and financial experts say that the basics of the business remain sound, the lofty stock prices have tumbled, leading renewable energy companies to scramble for new approaches to their businesses.Nowhere has the retrenchment been more acute than in a newfangled financing mechanism called a yieldco. Yieldcos, public companies conceived by renewable energy companies as a way to raise cheaper capital for project development, have attracted billions in new investments. The yieldcos buy and operate power plants, mainly those that their parent companies develop. The yieldcos then collect the contracted electricity fees and pay the bulk of them out as dividends. With investors hungry for stable returns, energy yieldcos were greeted with enthusiasm through initial public offerings of their stocks over the last year and a half.Last week, though, one of the most aggressive companies in the sector called a timeout. \u201cWe need to adjust our tactics, at least in the short to intermediate term,\u201d Ahmad R. Chatila, SunEdison\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. That adjustment is hardly unique to SunEdison, or even to yieldcos. Last month, NRG Energy announced that it would separate its once-heralded green enterprises \u2014 which include a home solar division and an electric vehicle charging network \u2014 into a separate company with a tight budget. It also said it would pursue a more limited strategy with its yieldco. On Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded that company, NRG Yield, saying the 30 percent decline in its share price in recent months would inhibit its ability to raise money for new projects.Still, executives and analysts say that the industry\u2019s long-term prospects remain sound.\u201cSince July, the sun has continued to shine and the wind has continued to blow and the performance of the wind farms and solar farms that are in the ground hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d said Paul Coster, an analyst at J. P. Morgan. \u201cThis is really in large part turmoil of the market\u2019s own making.\u201dNonetheless, that market churn is complicating efforts to push renewable energy to mass scale at a critical time in its development. As subsidies, incentives and mandates totter on the brink of planned and potential extinction, it is more important that the industries reduce costs to compete in the marketplace, experts say. Yieldcos were to be an important part of solving that puzzle. Without them, advocates say, it may be harder to reach that goal.\u201cInitially there was some euphoria and some market overreaction to the idea,\u201d said Aneesh Prabhu, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cBut the bloom has come off the rose.\u201d The idea behind yieldcos was simple on its face: Bundle together completed or nearly completed power projects that ostensibly offered steady, low-risk cash flows in the form of power purchase agreements covering electricity payments over 15 years or so. Because they were tied to power plant developers \u2014 including Abengoa, NextEra Energy and Pattern Development \u2014 the yieldcos would have steady pipelines of projects from the parent companies and the parent companies could replenish their capital through those sales.Part of the rationale was that energy development is expensive and renewable energy projects do not have access to tax-advantaged financing mechanisms like master limited partnerships. Those partnerships have spurred the building of oil and gas infrastructure like pipelines over the decades. \u201cThis was an inventive twist on master limited partnerships, and provided some of the same benefits,\u201d said Dan W. Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford. But, he said, they do not get all the tax benefits.Nonetheless, for a while, the system proved attractive to investors, and analysts and clean-energy advocates predicted ever more activity and success in the sector. More than a dozen yieldcos have formed since 2013, and many have gone public, including 8point3 Energy Partners, a joint venture of First Solar and SunPower that raised $420 million in its initial public offering in June.But as yieldcos proliferated \u2014 each with a hunger to bring in new projects to satisfy investor demand for growth \u2014 they drove up competition and prices for projects. Investors began to lose confidence that there would be enough projects to go around. In addition, the threat of rising interest rates made the yieldcos less attractive than more conventional financing. And depressed prices for oil and gas brought down energy values over all.\u201cYour growth story is only as good as your last project or your pipeline that you\u2019re projecting,\u201d said John J. Marciano III, a lawyer at Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on the development, financing, purchase and sale of energy and infrastructure projects and aviation equipment. \u201cOnce one started to go down, the others just probably followed the pack.\u201dSeveral analysts and executives attributed the declines to a mismatch between the investors \u2014 which include hedge funds looking for a relatively quick return \u2014 and the investments, intended to pay back over a long time. Others said investors who were losing money in oil and gas began dumping their renewable stocks to cover those losses.Either way, the new companies became caught in a kind of self-reinforcing downward spiral in which the drop in share prices raised dividend yields, making it more expensive to borrow money or issue equity. That, in turn, lowered the returns on new projects and pushed down share prices even more. \u201cPretty soon, a number of investors got scared to the point of saying, \u2018Look, do we really understand this model and is it broken?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michael Garland, chief executive of Pattern Development and Pattern Energy Group. He and others argue that the model works but must go through a market correction and attract different kinds of investors.At SunEdison, one of the most prominent companies involved, there were additional pressures. Its acquisition spree \u2014 especially its purchase in July of Vivint Solar, a fast-growing rooftop solar installer that markets its services to residential customers \u2014 left investors wary and confused. Executives at SunEdison, whose stock has declined by 70 percent since the Vivint announcement, acknowledged last Wednesday that they needed to do a better job of explaining to investors what they were doing and why.Despite all the turmoil, executives say interest in clean energy remains robust. \u201cThere may not be that much enthusiasm for yieldcos, but the pendulum has swung to the opposite direction,\u201d with private lenders and corporations making investments, said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of SolarCity. That company has not yet created a yieldco but Mr. Rive said it was \u201ckeeping an open mind\u201d to the approach, saying, \u201cFinancing is still very strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quarterly Earnings Reports Can Still Move Markets", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesIt is earnings season, and for much of corporate America it is a time of trouble.Publicly traded companies have been revealing their profits and losses for the third quarter of the year and signaling some of their expectations for the future. While a few big companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft posted strong earnings last week, many of the report cards have been dreary.Factors like global interest rates, politics and the national mood affect the stock market, but earnings are crucial, and how investors interpret this deluge of information may well determine whether share prices keep rising in the months ahead. Some of the mediocre earnings data has already been baked into share prices, which rose sharply last week and have just about recovered from the summer\u2019s sharp decline.But even in an era of seemingly limitless online information and nanosecond trading, quarterly earnings reports and conference calls retain their ability to move markets, a new study has found.It found that the impact of earnings reports on stock prices has increased since a series of Wall Street scandals led to regulatory reforms that appear to have improved the reliability of the reports, Ms. McNichols said. \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that the markets are deriving a great deal of information from these reports.\u201dThis season, much of the information has been gloomy, and it may take some mental gymnastics to see a silver lining in it. The global economy has slowed, the energy sector has been battered, and the strength of the dollar has reduced sales and profits overseas.When all of the data is in, Wall Street is expecting that for the third quarter of 2015, overall earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index will have declined, perhaps by as much as 3 percent. This follows a weak second quarter \u2014 one that, depending on which numbers you use, was flat or slightly negative.What\u2019s more, based on corporate disclosures and Wall Street expectations, the decline in profits is projected to continue for the rest of this year.But bad as this litany may seem, it may not be the end of the downward trajectory in earnings. While the consensus on Wall Street is that 2016 will be better for big corporations, things are not expected to improve significantly until the end of next year \u2014 a distant and relatively opaque period, as far as such analysis goes.\u201cWall Street analysts are usually more optimistic in their projections for a year down the road and become more realistic when the time for earnings draws closer,\u201d said John Butters, a senior research analyst at FactSet. \u201cThat\u2019s happening again this year.\u201dThat said, it may well be realistic to expect an improvement in an important sector: energy, which accounts for the biggest drag on earnings. While third-quarter earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to drop 2.8 percent over all compared with the same period a year earlier, the drop for energy companies is estimated to be 65 percent, according to Wall Street consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Companies like Halliburton, which reported a 36 percent drop in revenue and a $54 million loss for the third quarter on Monday, have been hit hard by the decline in oil, coal and natural gas prices of the last year.But by the end of 2016, energy companies will be comparing their earnings with this year\u2019s dismal results, a much easier contest. It is also quite possible that energy prices will rise from the doldrums by then, bolstering the sector and statistics for the entire stock market.That\u2019s hardly the only earnings problem. Other sectors, like technology, have turned in weak overall performances.With reports like these, it may seem difficult to derive a positive message from this season\u2019s information. Yet many investors habitually discount bad news and highlight the bright side.Are reports of declining profits \u2014 or outright losses \u2014 really good? Perhaps not, but they are often not perceived as devastating.When losses are disclosed, they are often seen as \u201cunsustainable, often one-time events,\u201d Ms. McNichols said. The logic is that for-profit corporations exist only for that purpose: to make a profit. Executives must stem losses, if they hope to keep their jobs.Wall Street analysts therefore sometimes assume that the disclosure of a loss implies that corrective measures are being taken. On the other hand, disclosure of rising profit prospects is often taken as a sign of sustainable prosperity and may be enough to bolster share prices, she said.That is because when you buy a share of a company\u2019s stock, you are buying a portion of that company\u2019s long-term earnings stream. If you pay a reasonable price, you should have a good chance of profiting. That is the theory, at least. And it helps explain why many investors focus on earnings next year and the year after that, even when current earnings are miserable.Of course, some of this may be just be based on hope. For the market to rise much more this year, investors may just have to trust that the earnings downturn is an aberration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retirement Investors, Riding Out the Panic", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August, as the stock market plummeted, many investors jumped into the fray and sold off their holdings at a loss.Not everyone did this, though. There\u2019s some compelling evidence that individual investors who were engaged in passive retirement investing, through 401(k)'s and autopiloted target-date funds, hewed to their stock positions. The value of their holdings, in many cases, dropped, but such investors could benefit handsomely if the market resumes its long-term trend upward.The evidence isn\u2019t conclusive, but it is suggestive: One gauge that tracks trading activity in 401(k)\u2019s, for example, shows that the needle barely moved when the market headed south in August.Although trading levels in these retirement funds were seven times normal on Aug. 24 \u2014 the highest-volume trading day since 2011 \u2014 a 401(k) index monitored by Aon Hewitt showed that an average of only 0.026 percent of total account balances transferred in August. That compares with 0.021 percent for July, but is still less than a relatively tranquil May, in which 0.031 percent of balances moved.John Nofsinger, author of \u201cThe Psychology of Investing\u201d and a professor at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who researches behavioral economics, has found that the type of account people hold largely determines how they invest.\u201cPeople rarely trade in 401(k) accounts,\u201d Mr. Nofsinger said. \u201cBut in online brokerage accounts, there\u2019s more potential for trading.\u201d He said he was adding to his retirement funds in August \u201cbecause I could buy more shares at a lower price. I don\u2019t need the money next year or the year after.\u201dThe steady-as-she-goes attitude of many retirement fund investors contrasts sharply with the behavior of investors who, on cue, pulled billions out of stock funds to retreat to cash, mainly in the form of money-market funds. \u201cInvestors panicked,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. \u201cThe fear we saw in August related to international markets and signs of sluggish growth in China. Investors thought it was going to get worse.\u201dAs a result of this mass anxiety, investors over all yanked more than $1 billion from diversified stock mutual funds in the last two weeks of August, according to S&P Capital IQ and Lipper, and also pulled some $5 billion out of similar exchange-traded funds in the week ending Aug. 26. Investors moved relatively small amounts of money into funds with holdings in small and midsize companies and in some diversified alternative strategies aimed at making money from market declines, according to S&P Capital IQ/Lipper fund data.In short, while retirement investors appeared to be a big exception, the timeworn trend of active investors bailing out of stocks and jumping into the lifeboats of income-oriented vehicles has re-emerged in the recent downturn. That said, data on fund flows remains imprecise: No analyst has a detailed picture of how much E.T.F. or mutual fund money is being shifted by big institutions such as banks and hedge funds.Based on anecdotal evidence, industry analysts said they believed that the bulk of money being moved in and out of E.T.F.s was controlled by these big traders, not by individuals. Morningstar noted a surge of money in August into E.T.F.s specializing in sophisticated strategies that exploit a down market through leverage, options, commodities and volatility-focused funds; big, institutional investors may have been the source of these fund flows.One interesting sidelight emerged from the S&P Capital IQ/Lipper data: After investors pulled $5 billion out of traditional stock mutual funds in the week ending Aug. 26, when they re-entered the market the next week, nearly $8 billion flowed into stock E.T.F.s, which are mostly low-cost, passive index vehicles tracking large sections of the market.Another pattern emerged as well: When the market nosed up in late August and early September, investors again began to chase short-term returns.\u201cFund flows have a strong tendency to chase returns,\u201d said Alina Lamy, a senior analyst for Morningstar, the Chicago-based financial information company. \u201cBut in the past, investors haven\u2019t been the best market timers. During the 2007 crisis, for example, they were selling when they should\u2019ve been buying.\u201dIn any case, the overall move into cheaper funds has been part of an investor-friendly, long-term trend. The average fund expense ratio \u2014 what managers charge annually as a percentage of funds under management \u2014 dropped to 0.64 percent as of the end of 2014, Morningstar reports. That\u2019s down from 0.76 percent five years ago, a trend that\u2019s beneficial for fund investors, since more of their money goes to work and less of it goes to managers. Over the last decade, more than 95 percent of fund money has gone into the cheapest funds.What\u2019s clear is that, aside from cost-cutting trends, most active investors who try to time the market are usually wrong about when to get in and out. Subsequently, their errant behavior is punished by poor total returns.According to a long-running study by Dalbar Associates, a financial consulting company, over the 20 years through 2014, investors it surveyed earned slightly more than 5 percent annually. During the same period, the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500-stock index averaged nearly 10 percent a year.This huge performance gap is attributed to individuals trying to time the market during downturns, a perennial pitfall. During the market crash in October 2008, Dalbar\u2019s investors lost 24 percent, compared with about 17 percent for the S.&P. stock index, a pattern most likely repeated on a smaller scale in August by active traders.People who bolt when they\u2019re scared and re-enter when they feel confident typically miss the best buying opportunities. They sell low and often buy high.Patient investors, however, are usually rewarded for sitting on their hands. Mr. Rosenbluth of S&P Capital IQ, who has tracked 20 stock market downturns in the minus 10 percent to minus 20 percent range since 1945, found that the average market recovery time was about four months from a bottom. Those engaged in panic selling, of course, never quite know when the nadir is \u2014 and usually aren\u2019t invested in the market to benefit from the upsurge.What if you just can\u2019t help yourself and want to flee to cash during the next market decline? Realign yourself with where you want to be in the future and trust in the likelihood that a global portfolio of stocks will outperform bonds and cash, Mr. Rosenbluth says. \u201cThree to five years from now,\u201d he said, \u201cwe think stocks will be higher.\u201dIn a similar vein, Ms. Lamy, the Morningstar analyst, said, \u201cControl what you can control and focus on long-term goals.\u201d That means beating inflation through stock investing, diversifying, planning for sustainable retirement income and ignoring short-term trends. Know how much risk you can take. If you felt queasy in August and jumped into icy waters, you were probably taking on too much market risk.The history of downturns holds some timeless lessons.The boring, passive approach of buy and hold has provided rewards in the stock market, but only for those people able to take the long view and hold on during stormy times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Assets Decline by Biggest Amount Since Financial Crisis", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the hedge fund industry attracted billions of dollars as investors searched for higher returns. But over several rocky months, managers reversed their gains for the year, investors headed for the exit and some firms shut down.Over all, the total amount of money that hedge fund managers have available to invest in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies shrank by $95 billion in the third quarter of the year, according to data from HFR, a firm that tracks the industry. It is the biggest decline in assets since the third quarter of 2008 in the depths of the financial crisis.Investors have been left with steep losses after months of global market volatility set off by a series of unexpected moves by central banks around the world, political turmoil in Greece, a debt default in Puerto Rico and a market rout in China. The turbulence has been unkind to every type of strategy deployed by hedge fund managers, from investing in distressed companies to buying equities.While the headlines have been dramatic, market turbulence so far this year has not reached the same level as late 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, the last time the industry experienced such a big decline. This has prompted some criticism that hedge funds, which were originally meant to protect investors from huge swings in the market, are not doing their job.The biggest names in the hedge fund industry have seen their gains for the year reversed. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management has lost 9.4 percent so far this year, while Marcato International, a hedge fund run by Mick McGuire, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Ackman, has lost 11.6 percent. Hedge fund managers who have gained sterling records in recent years are suffering, including Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management, who is down 13.5 percent.The men at the top of the hedge fund universe now run firms that are bigger than they have ever been.Among the worst-hit hedge fund managers are those who took large concentrated bets in the same stocks, so-called hedge fund hotels. Nine of the most popular stocks owned by hedge funds, including Valeant and Cheniere Energy, lost more than 20 percent over the quarter, according to research by Novus.September was particularly difficult for many of these stocks.\u201cHedge funds are reeling from a relentless rout that has all but killed a year\u2019s worth of alpha in a matter of two weeks,\u201d said Stan Altshuller, chief research officer at Novus, a research firm.The list of hedge funds that are winding down has grown, too.The hedge fund industry now manages $2.87 trillion of investor money. The average hedge fund is down 1.5 percent as of the end of September, according to HFR. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index, by comparison is down by just over 1 percent.Advertisement"}

As stock and bond markets swooned in August and September, many investors withdrew their money in the hope of riding out the storm.Nevertheless, BlackRock reported net investment flows of $50 billion, driven by $23 billion moving into its exchange-traded funds called iShares. In the second quarter, the firm had net investment outflows of $7.3 billion.Overall assets under management, the most crucial gauge for investment managers, fell to $4.5 trillion at the end of September, from $4.7 trillion at the end of June.Assets in the firm\u2019s main profit driver \u2014 exchange-traded funds \u2014 were $1 trillion at the end of the quarter, mostly flat from the quarter that ended in June and up from $975 billion a year ago.\u201cDespite all the insecurities in the market, we had $50 billion in growth,\u201d said Laurence D.

The company\u2019s smaller-than-expected $2.6 billion offering is still the largest of the year so far.For First Data, completing the offering in this market was a feat, as other deals were hampered. Digicel, a telecommunications company, pulled out of its planned $2 billion I.P.O. last week, and Albertsons, set to become the second-biggest initial offering of the year, decided to delay pricing on its stock sale.Still, the payments processor First Data was seen as a bellwether for other public offerings, and Thursday\u2019s trading could be a concern to other companies looking to go public in the near term.\u201cThere is an I.P.O. market; it\u2019s just for fewer companies,\u201d Tom Farley, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, where First Data\u2019s stock is listed, said in a phone interview. \u201cFor some companies, being public is an urgent matter, for competitive reasons or capital reasons.

But this is the first time she has made such an investment in a public company. Ms. Winfrey also plans to give Weight Watchers unfettered access to her name and face for marketing purposes.\u201cWeight Watchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cI believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\u201dThough one of the best-known names in weight loss, the 52-year-old Weight Watchers has had declining membership rolls in recent years as it has lost out to newer and more technologically oriented paths to shedding pounds, including weight-loss apps and fitness-tracking devices.This year, Weight Watchers announced plans to cut roughly $100 million in additional costs and laid off the president of its North American business.After 10 straight quarters of declining sales, the stock had slumped 73 percent, to $6.79 on Friday. Only one analyst out of eight had encouraged investors to buy shares of Weight Watchers. But that did not stop Ms. Winfrey.\u201cIt\u2019s like a win on steroids,\u201d said Erich Joachimsthaler, the chief executive and founder of the Vivaldi Partners Group, a brand-strategy consulting firm. \u201cWeight Watchers cannot stay where they are, and by having that endorsement, it\u2019s not just about visibility but it helps them to build those brand values and associations that Oprah stands for.\u201dThroughout the years, Ms. Winfrey has been open about her struggle to maintain her own ideal weight.She embraced a liquid diet in the 1980s and lost more than 60 pounds \u2014 sending sales of the regiment, Optifast, skyward \u2014 only to regain some of the weight and later renounce the move. Years later, she ran the Marine Corps Marathon, finishing in 4 hours, 29 minutes.As a sign of her enduring popularity, her \u201cOprah Winfrey Show\u201d ran for 25 seasons until 2011, when she decided to start a cable channel, OWN, for the Oprah Winfrey Network.Her successful endorsement of products through her annual list of favorite things so often produced skyrocketing sales and popularity that the result was called the \u201cOprah Effect.\u201d Spanx, an undergarment used to make women look slimmer, was on the list in 2000, giving the then-unknown product national fame and helping turn its founder, Sara Blakely, into a billionaire.But it is unclear whether Ms. Winfrey\u2019s backing can help Weight Watchers expand outside of its core demographic and attract younger users, according to R. J. Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar.\u201cThere have been a lot of questions about the company\u2019s marketing and its ability to stay relevant in this day in age,\u201d said Mr. Hottovy. \u201cThe company still faces challenges. It\u2019s a very competitive field, but certainly having Oprah\u2019s backing is by all means positive.\u201dThis is not Weight Watchers\u2019 first marketing foray with a celebrity. The singers Jennifer Hudson and Jessica Simpson have been spokeswomen for the company, appearing in commercials and talking about their experiences using the program.The company agreed to issue Ms. Winfrey 6.4 million shares of common stock for $43.2 million, with the option to purchase an additional 3.5 million shares, the regulatory filing showed.A passage in an article last Tuesday about Oprah Winfrey\u2019s taking a substantial stake in Weight Watchers, and the stock\u2019s subsequent rise, was incomplete, in some copies, at the continuation of the article.

Sponsors Remain Confident in the Face of Volatility", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 It has been a tough week for Direxion, a sponsor of exchange-traded funds that make highly leveraged bets on various markets going up and down.Over the last few days, with global stock exchanges seesawing sharply between positive and negative territory, two of Direxion\u2019s funds \u2014 both of which use leverage three times the size of their assets to spur returns \u2014 have lost over $1 billion.\u201cWe are not encouraging this type of risk,\u201d said Mr. Eschmann, whose fund company oversees $8.5 billion in assets. \u201cBut there is a market for it. A lot of our clients like leverage \u2014 and they want as much of it as they can get.\u201dThe firms that sponsor these types of superleveraged funds together account for about $35 billion in exchange-traded investments, a small percentage of the surging E.T.F. market, which now surpasses $2 trillion. That is more money than is managed by hedge funds.Nevertheless, their growth highlights just how far ambitious E.T.F. providers will go to satisfy investor appetites.E.T.F.s trade on an exchange, like securities, and track a range of stock and bond indexes, as well as other assets like currencies and commodities. Investors have flocked to these funds, attracted by their liquidity and transparency.Markets may be volatile and investors may be pulling money out of funds, but for the long term, there appears to be no stopping the E.T.F. revolution.\u201cI think we are in the very early stages here,\u201d said Joseph H. Davis, the head of Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group. \u201cWe are seeing a global adoption of E.T.F.s.\u201dAt their sales stations, fresh-faced young men and smiling women pitched their products to browsing investment advisers. \u201cTargeting Yield?\u201d asked one advertising slogan. \u201cGo Beyond the Conventional,\u201d urged another.And if the success of E.T.F.s is to be judged by the quantity \u2014 if not quality \u2014 of its swag, then the good times are indeed rolling. Company tables overflowed with iPhone chargers, souped-up golf balls and all manner of branded pens.In explaining why his company has focused on triple-leveraged funds, Mr. Eschmann says that when Direxion (the letter x is a financial symbol for leverage) broke into the market seven years ago, ProShares, the market leader then and now, had already established its reputation with double-leveraged funds.To differentiate, Direxion upped the ante and started the first triple-leveraged fund.Mr. Eschmann cautions that the funds are not for the average investor (there are many such warnings in the funds\u2019 investment literature) and he says that active day traders and hedge funds are his main clients these days.Nevertheless, some participants view these funds and their appetite for risk as giving the sector a bad name. BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, for example, has said that leveraged E.T.F.s could \u201cblow up the industry\u201d some day.That day has not yet come, as Mr. Eschmann takes pains to point out.\u201cI think he was talking his own book,\u201d Mr. Eschmann said of the BlackRock leader\u2019s warning. \u201cHe was over the top in terms of risks \u2014 there has to be some buyer beware here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing May Be Cheaper, but Fees Still Hurt", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMutual fund expenses can take a big bite out of shareholders\u2019 returns. That bite, on average, is shrinking, but academic and industry experts say it could \u2014 even should \u2014 be diminishing faster: Plenty of investment companies still charge a lot, and many consumers still opt for pricey funds.Morningstar, the investment research company, and the Investment Company Institute, an industry group, both track mutual fund expenses. Their data, while differing slightly, tells the same tale: Investing in mutual funds is getting cheaper. And that means many investors can keep more of their return dollars.\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m sure about in investing is the lower the fee I pay, the more there\u2019s going to be for me,\u201d said Burton G. Malkiel, a professor emeritus of economics at Princeton University and the author of the well-known investment primer \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street.\u201d \u201cFees have come down, on average, because fees for index funds are so much lower than active funds, and people have moved to them.\u201dThe measurement of fund expenses is a little technical, but it\u2019s worth understanding. Fees are usually expressed as a ratio of expenses divided by fund assets. That number is called the mutual fund expense ratio.Morningstar, in its 2015 fee study, reported that the asset-weighted average expense ratio for all funds was 0.64 percent last year, down 15 percent from five years earlier. Someone who invested $10,000 in a fund with that expense ratio would pay $64 a year in expenses. Thus, if her fund returned 5 percent, or $500, in the first year, she would pocket $436.But falling expenses are \u201cmore than just a phenomenon of money going into a handful of low-cost providers,\u201d said Brian Reid, chief economist for the Investment Company Institute. \u201cCompetition has driven many companies to offer lower-cost share classes.\u201dA generation ago, investors typically had a choice between lower-cost funds acquired directly from fund companies and higher-cost ones generally bought through financial advisers. Today, investors using financial advisers can also often buy lower-cost shares, which don\u2019t carry the sales charges that the industry calls loads. Advisers typically charge their clients asset-management fees, and then purchase the cheaper shares on behalf of those clients.\u201cIf you looked at funds that were broker-sold in 2000, about 50 percent had a no-load share class,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cNow about 90 percent of them have a no-load share class.\u201dFund companies are prospering anyway. Even with these kinds of changes, \u201cindustry fee revenue is at an all-time high, reaching $88 billion,\u201d Morningstar said. Over the last decade, total assets under management have more than doubled, while fee revenue has grown by approximately 78 percent, the company said. Yet funds\u2019 asset-weighted expense ratios declined by only 27 percent. \u201cThus a much larger share of the benefits of the increase in assets under management has stayed with the industry rather than being returned to fund shareholders,\u201d Morningstar said.On one level, that\u2019s not surprising: Fund companies are typically motivated by profit, and their goal is to enrich their owners. (Vanguard, which is owned by fund shareholders, is an exception.)Yet every mutual fund has its own board of directors, which has a fiduciary responsibility to serve the interests of the fund\u2019s shareholders, not the investment company that sponsors it, said David M. Smith, a finance professor at the State University of New York at Albany. Fund boards \u201cneed to think much more seriously about expense ratios that they are authorizing,\u201d he said.\u201cTo me, this is one of the big disconnects in the industry,\u201d he added. \u201cToo often, fund boards of directors don\u2019t seem to be looking out for the interests of the fund shareholders\u201d when it comes to expenses, he said.Seemingly small differences can add up to major costs. An investment of $10,000 in a fund charging 0.33 percent and returning an annual average of 10 percent would be worth about $100,000 after 25 years, while the same investment in a fund charging 1.69 percent would be worth only about $70,000. That gap in fees becomes significant when it\u2019s time to collect on the investment.\u201cHow is it that some fund boards believe it costs twice as much to invest in emerging markets as it does in developed ones?\u201d asked Russel Kinnel, Morningstar\u2019s director of mutual fund research. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of company information out there, and you don\u2019t need three analysts based in Tunisia.\u201dFund companies can incur higher costs when they manage money in less liquid markets like emerging countries, and this is reflected in expense ratios, said Tim Cohen, a chief investment officer at Fidelity Investments. \u201cWe do look at where the rest of the market is priced\u201d when setting expense ratios, he said.If there is consensus about expenses among analysts and academics, it is that cheaper funds are likely to provide better returns to investors. For example, Morningstar has examined expense ratios repeatedly and found that, over the long term, the performance of cheap funds beats that of their costlier cousins.\u201cI\u2019ve done studies that find that funds in the cheapest quintile of expense ratios are a much better bet than the rest of the fund world, even the second-cheapest quintile,\u201d Mr. Kinnel said. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in this finding, and one of the reasons I have so much confidence is that every time we study it, it has predictive value.\u201dIn investing, as elsewhere in life, cheap is relative. Professor Malkiel said his benchmark for bargains in a fund category was whatever the cheapest index funds charged. Actively managed mutual funds, on average, don\u2019t beat the market, he said. Thus the sensible path for retail investors is to accept the market\u2019s returns, minus low expenses, that index funds can deliver, he said. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t hold if active funds were getting a higher post-fee return,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the evidence is abundantly clear that they\u2019re not.\u201dNot everyone wants to invest only in index funds, of course. Some investors enjoy the challenge of finding a fund that might beat the market. Others believe that active managers can succeed in less picked-over sectors or deliver market-matching returns with less risk.Investors who opt for actively managed funds should seek those that have delivered a better-than-average return over three to five years than peer funds and have cheaper-than-average expense ratios, said Todd R. Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ.\u201cThat way, the fees won\u2019t weigh your returns down as much,\u201d he said. \u201cActively managed equity funds have around a 1 percent expense ratio on average. So if you\u2019re paying more than that, you may be paying too much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Valeant\u2019s Shares Fall on Report\u2019s Fraud Claim", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byValeant Pharmaceuticals is shaping up to be the next big Wall Street brawl.Its shares soared to new heights earlier this year after investors followed big-name hedge fund managers like William A. Ackman and John P. Paulson into the drug company. Mr. Ackman even likened it to Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.In recent months, however, Valeant has lost momentum as media and regulatory scrutiny of its aggressive drug pricing policies has grown. The company disclosed last week that it had received subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information about its pricing policies and its distribution procedures.Against that skeptical backdrop, a research firm\u2019s report that all but called Valeant the pharmaceutical equivalent of Enron hit the stock market like a bomb Wednesday morning. The report from Citron Research, a favorite of short sellers who bet against stocks, set in motion a tidal wave of selling. At one point, shares of Valeant were down as much as 40 percent.Citron claimed it had evidence that Valeant was secretly controlling two little-known drug distribution companies, and it speculated that this arrangement was meant to create \u201cphantom sales\u201d and false revenues in an effort to deceive auditors and investors.Valeant\u2019s biggest shareholders were staring at steep losses by midday, but the stock price recovered a bit in the afternoon after the company issued a news release calling the Citron report \u201cerroneous.\u201dAnd Mr. Ackman, who already owned a 5.7 percent stake in the company, doubled down, buying more than 2 million additional shares, according to a spokesman for Mr. Ackman\u2019s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.By the end of the day, Valeant\u2019s shares closed down 19.1 percent, at $118.61, in very heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating that the skepticism about Valeant goes beyond the research report. Valeant\u2019s response\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0did not answer some of the questions that investors have about its relationships with affiliates.\u00a0The tumultuous day followed several months of heavy selling in the stock, which has halved in value since July. In addition to Mr. Ackman, hedge funds like Mr. Paulson\u2019s Paulson & Company, as well as ValueAct, Lone Pine Capital and Viking Global, are among the top 20 holders in the stock. The biggest owner of Valeant stock is the Sequoia Fund run by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, which was once recommended by Mr. Buffett.But the proof offered by Citron for its explosive charge that Valeant is another accounting fraud like the onetime energy highflier Enron was more circumstantial than conclusive.Citron said it arrived at its conclusion after examining the relationship between two entities, Philidor Rx Services and R&O Pharmacy, so-called specialty pharmacies that fill prescriptions for certain types of drugs made by Valeant. Citron\u2019s eight-page report noted that the two small companies shared a common customer service number even though Philidor is based in Pennsylvania and R&O has its headquarters in California. The report also noted similarities in websites for both companies.This led Citron to assert that they are the \u201csame company\u201d and part of a scheme to create false sales.In past accounting frauds, companies have recorded revenue in their public financial statements by making false sales to affiliates. In its report, Citron said that Valeant appeared to be creating fake revenue through \u201cphantom sales\u201d to affiliated entities.Valeant pushed back against the notion that it might be booking fake revenue. The company said that its consolidated net revenue does not include sales to Philidor and its network, which, it said, includes R&O. Valeant added that it records sales in its consolidated revenue only \u201cwhen the product is dispensed to the patient.\u201dA person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said neither Valeant nor Philidor own R&O. Corporate records in California list Russell Reitz as one of the owners.In a wrinkle, Philidor said that while it did not currently have direct equity ownership in R&O or affiliated pharmacies, it had \u201ca contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval,\u201d according to a statement Wednesday evening.Andrew Left, founder of Citron, confirmed in a phone conversation that he had placed a bet against Valeant. Mr. Left said he thought Valeant\u2019s response \u201chas a lot of holes in it.\u201dIt has been a difficult time for Valeant, which sells an array of specialty drugs and generic pharmaceuticals. Over the past several weeks, the company, which has its headquarter in Canada, has found itself drawing criticism for its pricing policy for certain drugs amid a broader public concern about pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of consumers by rapidly escalating prices for certain specialty drugs.Even before Citron\u2019s critical report roiled the market, Valeant\u2019s dealings with Philidor had begun to unnerve Wall Street. On Monday, a top executive for Valeant disclosed during a quarterly earnings conference call that a year ago it had purchased an option to buy the small drug distributor based in Hatboro, Pa.In the call, J. Michael Pearson, Valeant\u2019s chief executive, said Valeant had begun consolidating Philidor\u2019s financial results in its own finances.Valeant\u2019s disclosure prompted a number of Valeant skeptics, including some hedge fund managers, to post information online about Valeant and Philidor.One of those who posted critical information online about Valeant was John Hempton, an Australian hedge fund manager, long noted for his bearish stance on stocks.It is not the first time that Mr. Hempton and Mr. Ackman have found themselves the standard-bearers for two sides of a trade. Mr. Hempton, the founder of Bronte Capital, has been an outspoken bull on shares of Herbalife, the nutritional supplement manufacturer. Conversely, Mr. Ackman\u2019s hedge fund has a major bet that shares of Herbalife will collapse and that the company will be proved to be an unlawful pyramid scheme.In some ways, the bitter bullish and bearish arguments over Valeant are starting to mirror the long-simmering dispute between investors over Herbalife\u2019s prospects.In a post on his blog, Mr. Hempton focused attention on a lawsuit that R&O filed against Valeant in federal court in California. In the lawsuit, R&O is seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not owe Valeant $69 million in payments for selling some of its drugs. The Camarillo, Calif., based company filed the lawsuit after Valeant\u2019s lawyers sent it a letter demanding payment.R&O, in its lawsuit, said that until the letter from Valeant\u2019s lawyer arrived, it had \u201cnever received a single invoice or a single demand for payment from Valeant in any amount.\u201dThe lawsuit said that either Valeant and R&O were both victims of a fraud, or Valeant was \u201cconspiring\u201d with another party to defraud R&O.Gary Kaufman, a lawyer for R&O, declined to comment on the Citron report.Internet records report the second website for R&O was created in May and is hosted by a web operator in Pennsylvania.Valeant, in its response to the Citron report, said that R&O was part of the Philidor pharmacy network and made use of \u201ca common call center phone number serviced by Philidor.\u201dIn the lawsuit, R&O said Valeant submitted a voucher for a payment of $69 million. In its response to the Citron report, Valeant said the net amount of the revenue owed to it is about $25 million.In theory, if the companies are indeed separate, those sales should be immediately recorded in Valeant\u2019s consolidated revenue, even before the drugs are dispensed to the patient. The fact that Valeant said it sales to R&O were not recorded in its revenue suggests that R&O is closely tied to Valeant nonetheless.Andrew Pollack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Risks, Cuomo Bets on Solar Power to Lift Buffalo", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has committed up to $750 million to the project, the biggest economic development effort he has undertaken in his five years as governor.In doing so, he has not just bet big on solar energy, a competitive and rapidly growing business, but also on the success of SolarCity, a fast-growing California company that will operate out of the factory that the New York State will own.The potential benefits seem substantial: The state has said the 1.2 million-square-foot SolarCity factory, which is scheduled to open in early 2016, will create 5,000 jobs, with 3,000 of them in western New York.\u201cThe ultimate goal is to get these upstate economies, including Buffalo, off their backs and onto their feet and the real measure of success is private-sector job creation and investment, and I think you are seeing that,\u201d said Howard Zemsky, chief executive of Empire State Development, the government\u2019s economic development agency.The project is not without risk, some of it associated with SolarCity. Its chairman is the entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also leads Tesla, the electric car company. And it could take years to assess whether the project was worthy of the praise heaped on it in 2013, when the project was announced.\u201cThis is like the Yankees coming to Buffalo,\u201d said Alain E. Kaloyeros, president of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, an adviser to Governor Cuomo who has been involved in the Buffalo project. \u201cThis is like the Buffalo Bills winning the Super Bowl.\u201dAmong the issues raised by investors is a federal tax credit for solar that has benefited SolarCity; the tax credit is scheduled to decrease to 10 percent from 30 percent for commercial customers in 2017 and be eliminated for homeowners.\u201cThis is speculative stuff,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative research group. \u201cThis is not like opening the checkbook for Mercedes-Benz, a known entity with a known and tested product.\u201dWhile it is not known if SolarCity is a focus of the investigation, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Lyndon Rive, said in an interview that his company had not been subpoenaed and does not believe it was a target.New York did not set out to bet big on solar panels or SolarCity.Buffalo has been the centerpiece of the governor\u2019s plan to revitalize the upstate economy. In his first term, Mr. Cuomo pledged $1 billion to try to help the city, an investment the administration has said would eventually create 14,000 jobs.In November 2013, the Cuomo administration announced it planned to invest $225 million there to build a facility for high-tech and green-energy businesses. Two tenants were identified: Soraa, a California-based manufacturer of LED lighting; and Silevo, which makes solar panels.In June 2014, SolarCity announced it was buying Silevo. Despite the lucrative tax credit attached to the deal, Mr. Rive, who is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin, said in an interview that the deal Silevo had in place with New York did not play a role in his decision to buy the company. \u201cThe primary economic value of the company was all on the technology,\u201d he said.Then, three months after SolarCity bought Silevo, Mr. Cuomo said the state was expanding its initial $225 million investment in the Buffalo project to $750 million. SolarCity, it was announced, would be the facility\u2019s lone tenant. Soraa is currently in talks with the state to find space elsewhere, according to a company spokesman.Mr. Zemsky, the chief executive of the development corporation, said the size of the investment grew dramatically because SolarCity was such a dominant player. \u201cThat increased the stability of the bet on solar by a lot and increased the size,\u201d he said.Solar stocks have fallen sharply recently, hurt in part by low gas prices. Still, over the long run, solar stocks have generally done well, fueled by consumer interest in the growing industry. In August, Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on SolarCity to \u201coverweight,\u201d the equivalent of a buy rating, and in a research report noted that the company was the industry\u2019s \u201cpre-eminent residential leasing company\u201d with a \u201chighly creditworthy customer base.\u201dSolarCity customers tend to lease their systems, and pay the company a monthly fee. Mr. Chanos, the trader who has made a financial bet that the stock will fall, says it is a problematic business strategy.\u201cYou basically lease the panels from SolarCity, they put them on your house and they collect the lease payments,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.\u201cSo in effect, if you put on the panels, you have a second mortgage on your home because you hope it is an asset, but in many cases it turns into a liability,\u201d he added, because prices in the relatively new sector would drop.Mr. Chanos would not disclose the size of his investment.Mr. Rive said Mr. Chanos was misinformed. Customers who lease solar panels ultimately save money on utilities, he said. \u201cThere is no lien on the house. We save customers money,\u201d he said.Because SolarCity owns the panels, it benefits from a generous 30 percent federal-investment tax credit for solar power, which will be significantly reduced or go away altogether in 2017. Mr. Rive acknowledged that if the tax credit were not extended, there could be \u201cmassive, massive devastation that occurs in the industry.\u201d However, he said, SolarCity was preparing for the tax credit\u2019s elimination, and the company now had the lowest cost structure in the country. As a result, he said it would \u201cthrive\u201d regardless of what happened.The Solar City project has emerged as a high-profile test of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s economic strategy, one that relies heavily on using state money to lure companies to New York. Since taking office, the governor has offered incentives to numerous corporations to operate in New York.\u201cIf you don\u2019t offer government incentives to a business this big,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said of 1366 Technologies, \u201cbasically you are not even in the game.\u201dBut watchdog groups warn that New York often bets on the fortunes of companies with little or no track record. And when the state subsidies end, the companies themselves may pull up stakes.\u201cNew York has a huge history of putting enormous amounts of money into a small basket,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.Mr. McMahon, of the Empire Center for Public Policy, added that New Yorkers are paying a high price for the jobs these subsidies attract. \u201cWe are essentially paying people to do things here,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Zemsky is confident the state\u2019s investment on solar power will pay big dividends, even if the industry itself stumbles. \u201cIf the solar industry were to go through hard times,\u201d he said, \u201cand if there were to be consolidation, I think that typically benefits the larger players.\u201dAn article on Oct. 26 about the construction of a factory in Buffalo for SolarCity misidentified the company\u2019s chief executive. He is Lyndon Rive, not Peter Rive. (The two are brothers.)Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Timely Reminder of Bonds Funds\u2019 True Value", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise its target interest rate drew plenty of attention last quarter, but the real news for bond investors was what actually did happen.Namely, high-quality bonds delivered on their core role as life jacket in residence for diversified portfolios.When the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 12 percent from late July to late August, the $170 billion invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund and exchange-traded fund gained nearly 0.8 percent.Among actively managed funds, the $98 billon Pimco Total Return bond fund shed less than a half a percent and the $67 billion Metropolitan West Total Return bond fund gained 0.4 percent.The calm before the storm, you say? After all, the Federal Reserve didn\u2019t cancel a rate increase, but for the umpteenth time just pushed it out a bit further.True, but the timing of the first move is far less important than the magnitude of what comes after. And that\u2019s not looking nearly as ominous as what has been predicted by the bond fearmongers for the last seven years.At a news conference last month, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said that even after the initial increase, policy \u201cwill likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time.\u201dThe plain-English translation: We want to start moving our target rate from the zero level that has been in place since the financial crisis, but we are in no rush to move it much, or move it fast, given that there\u2019s no sign of our economy overheating.In its latest communiqu\u00e9 the Fed indicated that it did not expect its target interest rate to exceed 2.6 percent before 2018.\u201cThis next cycle of rising rates is going to be far more benign than past cycles,\u201d says Ford O\u2019Neil, lead manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Total bond fund (and its E.T.F. clone) and a 25-year bond market vet.That suggests long-term investors using core bond funds as portfolio diversifiers might benefit from tuning out all the anxiety about the coming rate rise.Total returns will indeed probably dip into negative territory when rates do begin to rise. Bond fund and E.T.F. total returns are the sum of interest payouts and price changes. When yields rise, prices fall. But the damage should be a bruised elbow, not a trip to the emergency room.Since 1926, there have been just five periods when intermediate-term Treasury prices fell more than 5 percent \u2014 the average was a 7 percent loss over 11 months \u2014 but losses were recouped in three to seven months, according to Morningstar. Not exactly an eternity if you\u2019re a long-term investor.But it might feel like one along the way. Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, which manages more than $140 billion in United States bond portfolios, including the MetWest Total Return bond fund, says that after seven years of extremely low volatility courtesy of the Federal Reserve\u2019s spurring a big borrowing boom \u2014 releveraging, in marketspeak \u2014 he expects volatility to snap back \u201clike a jack-in-the-box\u201d when the bond market begins its march to normalization.MetWest Total Return shifted to a \u201crisk off\u201d stance 18 months ago, given a dearth of compelling values and the fact that \u201clong releveraging cycles don\u2019t go on forever,\u201d Mr. Rivelle said. The fund\u2019s current average five-year duration, a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is more conservative than the 5.6 years for the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index. And while up to 20 percent of the fund can be invested in high-yield bonds, it currently has less than 5 percent riding on so-called junk.Thomas H. Atteberry, manager of FPA New Income, is always worried about risk. For decades the fund has been able to deliver on its two mandates: deliver a positive return over 12 months, and over a five-year stretch generate an annualized return that is at least one percentage point better than inflation. But right now the fund\u2019s five-year return is running about a quarter of a percentage point above inflation.\u201cJob 1 is protection of capital, and you can\u2019t do that and generate higher returns, given that risk-free Treasuries are yielding less than inflation,\u201d Mr. Atteberry said. Treasuries maturing in fewer than 10 years currently pay less in interest than the inflation rate. FPA New Income\u2019s average duration is below 1.5 years.Research Affiliates, which designs asset allocation and index strategies, expects even core bond funds to outpace inflation by only one percentage point annually over the next 10 years. (Before you groan at that, consider that the firm estimates the S.&P. 500\u2019s annualized real return will also be around 1 percent.)Mutual funds and E.T.F.s own a hefty share of them, and the worry is that if too many investors want to sell their shares the next time the markets hit trouble, the funds could push bonds into a downward spiral, sending prices even lower.The Loomis Sayles Bond Fund has the leeway to venture far afield from the high-grade United States issues at the heart of core bond funds, in search of higher income and returns.Over the last 15 years, the fund\u2019s 8 percent annualized gain has performed three percentage points better than the average core bond fund. A co-manager, Elaine Stokes, says the fund is currently near its 35 percent maximum allocation in high-yield bonds, a position that grew late last year when the commodity sell-off created better values.The fund also has a small slug of dividend-paying stocks, convertibles and some foreign government bonds. That generates a current yield of close to 4 percent, nearly double the income payout for core bond funds.But a seatbelt is required for times when market volatility perks up. Last quarter the fund lost more than 4 percent, as riskier bonds were yanked down in the face of global growth concerns. Similar multisector bond funds lost 2.6 percent on average.Perhaps the best risk-reward trade-off right now is municipal bonds. Yields are in line with what Treasuries currently pay out, and that\u2019s before you factor in the tax break if you\u2019re investing in a taxable account.The 1.8 percent current yield for the high-grade Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt fund is the equivalent of 2.5 percent if your federal tax bracket is 28 percent.For investors in the 35 percent tax bracket, the effective yield is 2.8 percent. That puts you well ahead of the 2.1 percent yield for the taxable Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$9.8 Billion Valuation for Ferrari", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, car fanatics have dreamed of owning a Ferrari. Now they can own at least a piece of the company.The sports car manufacturer priced its initial public offering on Tuesday at $52 a share, the top end of an expected price range, raising more than $894 million for its corporate parent, Fiat Chrysler. The stock sale values the racecar specialist at about $9.8 billion.Ferrari begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning under \u2014 what else? \u2014 the ticker symbol RACE, at a tough time for European automakers. Weeks earlier, shares of its parent and those of other European automakers sagged for a time in the wake of the diesel emissions cheating scandal at Volkswagen.It will also triumphantly enter a stock market that has proved trying for many other market debutants.Ferrari, of course, is not a payments company or a Silicon Valley start-up or a grocery chain. It is one of the most venerated names in high-end sports cars, having drawn the affection of car aficionados for decades. (The company\u2019s road shows for potential investors drew capacity crowds in cities like New York and London, according to reports.)Founded by the racecar driver Enzo Ferrari \u2014 known as \u201cil Grande Vecchio,\u201d or \u201cthe Great Old Man,\u201d late in life \u2014 the company did not start out as a car manufacturer. Instead it was Scuderia Ferrari, a racing team that initially used Alfa Romeo cars.Throughout its history, Ferrari has cultivated an allure of exclusivity. Last year, the company shipped just 7,255 cars, compared with the 4.6 million cars and trucks that Fiat Chrysler moved the same year. And those 7,255 cars, Fiat contends, were part of a 34 percent rise in shipments over the last decade.That has proved a lucrative business. Ferrari earned 141 million euros in net profit, or about $160 million, for the first half of the year. That is up 10 percent from the same time a year ago \u2014 and represents about a third of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s net profit for the period. Sales grew slightly over that same time, to 1.39 billion euros.Despite going public, Ferrari will remain tightly controlled by a small collection of investors. Fiat Chrysler sold about 10 percent of the company, while Piero Ferrari will hold onto his 10 percent stake.

{"Headline": "Spread Out Risk in Your Portfolio by Company, Not Country", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you set out to build a diversified stock portfolio, should you emphasize assembling a broad mix of businesses or a broad mix of countries where the business is done?Recent research suggests that the first factor is more important because globalization has diminished the relevance of the second.The returns of stock markets vary, but to a large degree that is because of concentrations in different sectors, Morningstar\u2019s analysis showed. From 2000 through mid-2014, for instance, more than half the variability in dividend growth across markets in developed economies was because of the mix of sectors among them, the study found.It has become routine to buy exchange-traded funds that focus on regions or single countries to help diversify a portfolio. But that tactic may have the opposite effect by inadvertently providing excessive exposure to one sector or another.\u201cInvestors in country E.T.F.s need to be aware of the potential correlation between them due to similar sector weights,\u201d said Philip Straehl, the senior research consultant at Morningstar Investment Management who wrote the study. \u201cSince sectors are a key driver of corporate fundamentals across international stock markets, diversification across sectors needs to be a key consideration when constructing global stock portfolios.\u201dKim Arthur, chief executive of Main Management, a firm that runs portfolios comprising E.T.F.s, agreed that if you are going to invest abroad, \u201cyou had better know the sector exposure you\u2019re getting.\u201d He noted that technology has a dominant weighting in Taiwan, for instance, and that financial services are a substantial sector in Hong Kong.The risk of having lopsided exposure to a sector is somewhat diminished for Americans who invest internationally if they have a broad domestic portfolio to begin with, Mr. Straehl said. The American market is more diversified than others, he pointed out, and the size of the American economy ensures that companies derive more of their sales and profits from within the country than is true elsewhere.Having a broad mix of sectors is vital for achieving diversification. Going a step further and tweaking the mix, allocating more to some and less to others based on prevailing business and economic conditions, may help investors beat the market consistently, some advisers contend. That is true for domestic and international portfolios alike, they say.\u201cSector allocation is more important than trying to find that perfect international allocation,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, a business that provides asset management and financial advice. \u201cWhen energy is going up, energy companies everywhere are going up. Materials companies go up on rising commodity prices.\u201dFinancial services is one of several sectors that typically perform poorly toward the end of an economic upswing and bull market, a period when interest rates often climb, he said. Other weaker late-cycle sectors are utilities and consumer discretionary, the group that includes retailers, airlines and manufacturers of big-ticket items like washing machines and cars.Better bets in an aging bull market, he said, are health care and technology, where earnings can continue to grow as the economy is beginning to roll over. Once a bear market begins, health care and other defensive sectors, such as consumer staples and utilities, generally outperform.During the early phase of a recovery, stocks in those sectors are comparatively weak as investors gravitate toward alternatives that are more sensitive to growth, such as technology, financials and consumer discretionary.Investors can use sector E.T.F.s to play these trends, and a rapidly expanding number of asset management companies, such as Mr. Arthur\u2019s, do it for a living. Assets in sector-rotation E.T.F. managed portfolios totaled $20.2 billion at the end of last year, according to Morningstar, a date selected because several companies were slow in reporting more recent figures. Three years earlier, the total was $6.3 billion.The patterns that Mr. Stack highlighted, with certain sectors rising and falling with or contrary to economic and market cycles, have been observed across many bull and bear markets. But capitalizing on them can be problematic for several reasons, advisers caution.It is difficult to know with any precision where the economy and market are except in hindsight, although Mr. Stack contends that there are usually signposts that give investors a rough idea if they are keen enough to spot them. Lately the evidence suggests to him that the market has reached a crossroads.The economy seems to be humming along, but \u201cfrom a technical standpoint this market appears to be in trouble,\u201d he said. The ratio of rising stocks over decliners began deteriorating before the third-quarter swoon, as did the ratio of stocks hitting 52-week highs versus lows. As a result, he has been \u201cshifting to defensive sectors, ones that do best in the last year of a bull market,\u201d he said, such as health care, and limiting exposure to financials and consumer discretionary.Another tricky aspect of sector investing is putting companies in the right boxes. Take Amazon.com and Netflix, two leading technology stocks that are not uniformly categorized as technology stocks by all analysts. The first is a retailer and the second provides entertainment, making them consumer discretionary companies, as Standard & Poor\u2019s reasons. The presence of such large, de facto technology companies could explain why consumer discretionary, a late-cycle sector, has continued to perform well.Another impediment to playing sectors profitably is that sometimes investors are all too aware of where they are in the cycle and pay too much to be in the right place at the right time, said Jan Erik Warneryd, senior portfolio manager of Hillswick Asset Management, another firm that runs E.T.F. managed portfolios.When history suggests that a particular sector should excel, it often turns out that \u201cpeople have already positioned themselves for it,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe want to do things that other people aren\u2019t doing.\u201dBased on the most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, published in mid-September, other people have had heavy allocations to consumer discretionary, bank and technology sectors. Managers have been light on materials and especially energy.Mr. Warneryd\u2019s largest positions are in telecommunications, health care and utilities, with a more modest overweighting in financials. His portfolio has a relatively light consumer discretionary weighting because it has \u201cthe richest valuation of any sector,\u201d he said. Contrary to his contrarian ambitions, his smallest holding is in energy.Mr. Arthur says he also is concerned about consumer discretionary valuations, and he finds telecoms overvalued, but he is more hopeful about energy. He notes that the average dividend yield on energy stocks, about 3 percent, is substantially higher than the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, recently 2 percent, a rare development after a prolonged decline in energy.\u201cWe have been stepping into it, but we could be stepping on a land mine,\u201d Mr. Arthur acknowledged, referring to energy. \u201cThat\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel with these things. Being early is a lot like being wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant\u2019s Drug Price Strategy Enriches It, but Infuriates Patients and Lawmakers", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd consumers like Bruce Mannes, a 68-year-old retired carpenter from Grandville, Mich., are facing the consequences.Mr. Mannes has been taking the same drug, Cuprimine, for 55 years to treat Wilson disease, an inherited disorder that can cause severe liver and nerve damage. This summer, Valeant more than quadrupled its price overnight.\u201cMy husband will die without the medicine,\u201d said his wife, Susan, who is now working a second part-time job to help pay for health care. \u201cWe just can\u2019t manage another two, three thousand dollars a month for pills.\u201dCuprimine is just one of many Valeant drugs whose prices have spiked as part of the company\u2019s concerted strategy, which has richly rewarded its investors and made it one of Wall Street\u2019s most popular health stocks.But Valeant\u2019s habit of buying up existing drugs and raising prices aggressively, rather than trying to develop new drugs, has also drawn the ire of lawmakers and helped stoke public outrage against the growing trend of higher and higher drug prices imposed by big drug companies. This year alone, Valeant raised prices on its brand-name drugs an average of 66 percent, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis, about five times as much as its closest industry peers.Some presidential candidates have also seized on the issue. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, called for efforts to control \u201cprice gouging\u201d after a public outcry over the actions of Turing Pharmaceuticals, which abruptly increased the price on a drug to $750 a tablet from $13.50.And last week, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform demanded that Valeant be subpoenaed for information about big price increases on two old heart drugs that the company acquired in February.The threat of government action is making the pharmaceutical industry nervous. A big sell-off in biotechnology stocks over the last two weeks helped wipe out the sector\u2019s gains for the entire year. Valeant\u2019s stock has been among the hardest hit, losing about a quarter of its value since Sept. 18. Still, the stock is trading for about six times as much as it was five years ago, a meteoric rise that far outpaced most drug companies.But Mr. Pearson, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, has said he has a duty to shareholders to wring the maximum profit out of each drug. And in some cases old neglected drugs sell for far less than newer drugs for the same diseases.If \u201cproducts are sort of mispriced and there\u2019s an opportunity, we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do,\u201d he told analysts in a conference call in April.Valeant is an extreme example of practices that have been around in the pharmaceutical industry for years. The United States, unlike most countries, does not control drug prices, and pharmaceutical manufacturers have relied heavily on steady and sometimes outsize price increases in this country to bolster their revenue and profits.Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3 percent of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20 percent of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey.Price increases provide an extra boost to the company\u2019s sales and profits.\u201cI\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t cost them $4,000 more to make,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just go buy a bottle of milk and suddenly the supermarket charges you $100.\u201dMr. Pearson has told analysts that it is standard industry practice to raise the price of a drug shortly before it faces generic competition, which Glumetza might face in February.The drug industry argues that list prices are typically not what health plans pay after discounts and rebates are negotiated, and there is evidence that these discounts are increasing.But even if patients are often shielded, the costs are paid by insurers, hospitals and taxpayers and lead to higher premiums and co-payments for everyone, critics say.Jeffrey M. Rosner, the senior director for pharmacy sourcing and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic, said that nine drugs with particularly egregious price increases had cost the hospital an additional $11.2 million annually, an increase of about 10 percent in drug costs for hospitalized patients. And Valeant\u2019s products represented 80 percent of that additional cost, he said.The price of one Valeant drug, Mephyton, which helps blood clot better, has been increased eight times since July 2014, he said, and now costs about $58.76 a tablet, up from $9.37. The price of another, Edecrin, a diuretic, has gone up nine times since May 2014 and is now at $4,600 a vial, up from about $470. When his staff called to inquire, Valeant refused to discuss pricing over the phone, Mr. Rosner said.Many drugs undergoing gigantic price increases are old and no longer have patent protection, raising the question of why generic alternatives do not pop up.The generic equivalent of Cuprimine, the drug taken by Mr. Mannes, is being sold by some foreign pharmacies for $1 a tablet, in contrast to the $260 Valeant is now charging.For some Valeant drugs there are generic alternatives. For others, the sales have been too small to interest a generic company. That could change now that the prices are higher, but it would probably take several years for a generic-drug maker to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to start selling such a product.More conventional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which conduct their own research and development, have rushed to distance themselves from companies like Turing and Valeant. The Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, expelled Turing, saying it did not reflect the organization\u2019s values. Martin Shkreli, who runs Turing, is also facing a federal criminal inquiry into his activities at a previous company, Retrophin, according to Retrophin regulatory filings.But while more conventional companies do not typically triple or quadruple prices overnight, they do often raise them year after year at a rate far faster than inflation. Big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Merck raised list prices an average of 13 percent in 2014 and 8 percent so far this year, according to Deutsche Bank.Ronny Gal, a pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said smaller price increases on widely used drugs had a much bigger effect on health care spending than the larger increases by Valeant on drugs with small sales.Dr. Irl B. Hirsch, a diabetes specialist at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, said insulin prices had risen so much in recent years that some patients were scrimping on groceries to pay for it. The price of a package of five Lantus injectable pens from Sanofi has gone from about $179 in 2010 to $372 last year, he said, and insurance will often cover only one package at a time.\u201cAll of this stuff that makes life so inconvenient, this would have been unheard-of five or 10 years ago,\u201d he said.The more conventional companies and their backers argue that research and development has a high risk of failure, so they deserve premium prices when a drug succeeds. They now are concerned that innovation will be undermined by a reaction to price increases imposed by companies like Turing and Valeant.Jacking up prices of old drugs, \u201cwith no R&D risk-taking, is just not right,\u201d Bruce Booth, a prominent life sciences venture capitalist, posted on Twitter Tuesday, adding that the practice \u201churts the industry & innovators.\u201dWith Valeant\u2019s stock price falling, Mr. Pearson sent a letter to employees last week, arguing that increased prices accounted for only a small and declining part of the company\u2019s business. \u201cValeant is well positioned for strong organic growth, even assuming little to no price increases,\u201d he wrote.But in the company\u2019s regulatory filing for the second quarter, Valeant said that its growth in the United States and other developed markets \u201cwas driven primarily by price,\u201d not by increased volume. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that \u201coutsized\u201d price increases on eight drugs accounted for about 7 percent of Valeant\u2019s revenue and 13 percent of its earnings before taxes and interest in the second quarter.For now, with Congress in the hands of Republicans and election season in full swing, quick government action on drug prices is considered unlikely.The Manneses are applying for financial assistance from a foundation recommended by Valeant to help pay for Cuprimine. But Ms. Mannes was upset enough to write to elected officials and call local television stations.\u201cThis madness has to stop,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax to Curb Excessive Trading Could Be a Boon to Returns", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyTaxes are inevitable. Most people don\u2019t like them. But once in a while, someone proposes a new one that could prompt the sort of behavioral change that may actually save some people money.There are all sorts of ways that this tax may cost many investors money in the long run. But considering its potential virtues, it is a useful exercise because it\u2019s akin to a sin tax. Trading too much hurts returns and is extremely hazardous to our wealth, and the less we do of it, the better off most of us will be.Financial transaction taxes are not new. They exist elsewhere in the world in various guises, and the United States has had them before. They tend to find favor after crises of various sorts, and so it goes with this one.So let\u2019s begin with the assumption that individual investors would get caught up in the costs somehow, no matter what Senator Sanders intends. What would be the behavioral reaction of people who have portfolios filled with individual stocks that they are used to trading in and out of?Why do people hurt themselves by trading in this manner? Is it like gambling, with its danger of addiction akin to cigarettes? Maybe a little. A different study Mr. Odean worked on showed that when Taiwan introduced a national lottery, trading on the stock exchange fell 25 percent. So at least people there were able to substitute something else for their wagering activity.Mr. Odean chalks up much of the trading to overconfidence. Most of us think we\u2019re better than the average investor, and men trade more than women. The Internet gives us the illusion of feeling well informed, so we conveniently forget that somebody else read everything we found before we did. Then, we compound the sins by failing to diversify. After all, we\u2019ve found the best investments, so why spread our risks among thousands of companies in a bunch of index mutual funds?Would a tax make a difference in the amount of trading? Mr. Odean says he thinks it is possible, though he noted that the Taiwanese seem to trade plenty, even though they have a financial transaction tax.Overall trading volume would be lower, which could negatively affect the ability to trade large quantities of some securities at advantageous prices. Investors could reprice stocks and bonds lower, permanently. Vast quantities of brainpower will redirect itself toward tax evasion. There is even the possibility that after-tax personal income could fall a bit, given the possibility of various financial actors redirecting where they put their capital.It\u2019s hard to know for sure, though the mutual fund giant Vanguard produced a model to show its displeasure with the idea. Its estimates from earlier this year, using a 0.1 percent tax that it would pay on stock transactions, predicted a 1.62 percentage point annual reduction in the returns of an actively managed mutual fund that buys small stocks. The decline for a fund buying larger stocks would be 0.58 percentage point. Its index funds would probably suffer less, though the company did not run those numbers.Most of us are not reckless traders, and many people who do trade frequently eventually see the error of their ways, so they probably don\u2019t suffer that big 7.2 percentage point difference in returns forever. A financial transactions tax would certainly help urge them along, and it could lead to bigger account balances over time as a result of the better returns that could come from decreased trading.But even if many people will not need their college savings accounts to earn as much in the future, the tax could hurt the returns of many well-behaved investors who never needed to learn any lessons in the first place. So rather than calling for any kind of tax that would trickle down to individuals, perhaps it\u2019s best for all of us to consider trading to be something like a tax itself. It hits us in three ways. First, we pay commissions to trade individual stocks and mutual funds in many instances. Second, taking winnings and selling can lead to a capital-gains tax bill.But most important, every additional trade (beyond what we must do to make regular investments and rebalance those investments back to our target mix and risk and pull money out for necessary spending) pushes us down a slippery slope of delusion. We are not professionals. We are not smarter than the market. And the sooner we learn that lesson, the less taxing our investment experience will be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sensible Pricing Comes to High-Risk Debt Securities", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneFor the first time since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s response, which was to drive down the cost of money to near zero \u2014 some rational pricing seems finally to be seeping into the market for the riskiest debt securities. This correction in the price of bonds is good news for investors, for markets generally and for the rest of us who hope not to suffer another deleterious credit collapse fueled by fee-seeking underwriters and speculators on Wall Street.A little background: It turned out that the combination of the Fed\u2019s recent policies of quantitative easing \u2014 an extensive $4 trillion effort to drive down long-term interest rates by bidding up the price of high-yielding debt securities \u2014 and its policy of keeping short-term interest rates as close to zero as possible for as long as possible have together been highly effective at keeping rates at low levels.The Fed\u2019s not-incorrect logic was that in the face of congressional unwillingness to enact a robust fiscal stimulus program, its robust monetary policy would kick-start an economy moribund after the shocking events of 2008 by making borrowed money cheap.Of course, there was collateral damage. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary intervention drove up the prices of many debt securities and lowered their yields, since the price of bonds trade in inverse proportion to their yields. As a result, for years investors have been engaged in the yield hunger games, scouring the world for higher returns on fixed-income securities than could be otherwise found in the safer confines of, say, the market for United States Treasury securities, where the yield on the 10-year bond is now around 2 percent.The investor frenzy to find higher yields had the consequence of driving up the price of high-yield bonds \u2014 among the riskiest debt securities around \u2014 and pushing down their yields to around 5 percent, which is what, in normal markets, an investor might expect to receive from bonds offered by top corporate issuers like General Electric or Johnson & Johnson. For years, risk has been mispriced as investors bid up the high-yielding debt securities in an effort to find something that paid them a decent return. But, of course, that\u2019s a fool\u2019s game, because eventually reality sets in.And now it has. For the first time since 2012, the collective yield on junk bonds rose in early October to above 8 percent, an increase of nearly 300 basis points since May 2013, according to an index of domestic high-yield bonds published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For investors who bought bonds at par in May 2013, the collapse in prices that corresponded with the higher yield means they have suffered some serious losses on their bonds. (Of course, they should have anticipated that when they bought them in the first place at such dizzying prices.)Bonds issued by companies in the independent energy sector, the metals and mining sector and oil field services sector have been the hardest hit as commodity prices have fallen. But bonds in other industries are also likely to fall in price, too. Standard & Poor\u2019s, the credit ratings agency, has downgraded the debt of more companies so far this year than in the last two years combined; in the third quarter alone it lowered ratings on some $211 billion of debt. According to Moody\u2019s, a rival to S.&P., some $50 billion of bonds and bank debt have defaulted so far in 2015. Moody\u2019s has compiled a list of another 44 companies it thinks might soon also default on their debt.I asked Christina Padgett, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s focused on leveraged finance, why the bond market had suddenly come to its senses after years of insanity. She started working in the high-yield debt market in 1998. She conceded she was not exactly sure. \u201cIt is a confluence of factors,\u201d she said, \u201cand not necessarily the same for the loan and bond markets.\u201d But she cited a few reasons: Increased volatility is \u201cnot good\u201d generally for the leverage finance market, nor was the late summer \u201cdowndraft\u201d in the equity markets. (The recovery in stocks in the last few weeks has also led to a bit of a recovery in the high-yield market.)Ms. Padgett also noted that a large portion of the high-yield market was composed of issuers in the energy sector, which has come under severe economic pressure as commodity prices have collapsed. She said she understood why investors in recent years had reached for yield. \u201cThere\u2019s very little yield in the world today and still lots of liquidity,\u201d she said. But she is still surprised at how badly risk has been mispriced.\u201cThere was no such thing as single-digit yields for single B\u2019s,\u201d when she started in the business, she said, referring to junk bonds with a B rating. Nevertheless, she told me, credit sensitivity seemed to be increasing as evidence mounted that the market was on the other side of the credit cycle. She added that the largest impact was probably a decline in opportunistic deals and dividends and the more aggressive leveraged buyouts.This is all good news. The time is long overdue for the insanity in the credit markets to come to an end. Investors need to be adequately compensated for the risks they are taking when they buy debt of tenuous credit quality. That\u2019s the only way to make sure the credit markets operate smoothly.It\u2019s healthy to see that investors are starting to wise up after seven years of a Fed-induced high. A big test of the newfangled investor sentiment looms: In the coming weeks, Dell, which is rated BB by S.&P. after of its leveraged buyout in 2013, will issue some $15 billion of high-yield debt to finance its audacious $63 billion takeover of EMC Corporation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Doubts Circle Viacom, Vanguard of Yesteryear", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhilippe P. Dauman, Viacom\u2019s chief, called his 92-year-old boss, Sumner M. Redstone, to discuss the news. Mr. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom who controls about 80 percent of the company, told Mr. Dauman not to worry and that the company would be fine, according to executives briefed on the conversation.The Mr. Redstone of 20 years ago \u2014 short-tempered and acerbic, known for monitoring quarter-point fluctuations in Viacom\u2019s stock and screaming until spit flew from his mouth \u2014 likely would not have been so reassuring. And several current and former Viacom executives, as well as industry analysts, question whether everything is fine at Viacom.So far this year, Viacom shares have plummeted about 37 percent, vastly underperforming the S&P 500, which is down about 4 percent. Plaguing the company are persistent declines in television ratings, weak ad sales and a lackluster film slate. Viacom also faces questions from Wall Street about more than $14 billion in stock buybacks, which analysts said could have been used to invest in or acquire fresh products or services. That shift in perception is dramatic. This was the company that helped launch the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life iconic characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer, and had several generations demanding the music videos of MTV. Now, Viacom has lost its perch amid the explosion of competition from traditional and digital outlets, like Netflix, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, Vine and Facebook. \u201cThere was a time when we defined what was cool for kids with MTV,\u201d one senior Viacom executive said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case anymore.\u201d Another concern is that the massive wave of consolidation sweeping across cable and satellite companies will greatly reduce the rates Viacom can charge for its programming and even creates the potential that cable or satellite companies like Dish could drop Viacom from their bundle of channels, since its programming is now available on a range of streaming services like Amazon and Hulu. Last year, more than 60 small cable operators, which account for about 2 million pay television subscribers in the United States, dropped Viacom\u2019s channels. Goldman Sachs downgraded its valuation of Viacom this week. The firm said that there was pressure on the stock for several reasons, including the fact that ratings at its television networks declined 14 percent year over year, the sixth consecutive quarter of ratings declines. (For comparison, Goldman Sachs said that Viacom\u2019s quarterly ratings have declined 20 percent on average since the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with a 7 percent decline for its peer group.)And Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein Research, went so far as to compare Viacom to Eastman Kodak, the photography company made obsolete by the digital world.\u201cWe realize this is a severe comparison,\u201d he said in a July research note, \u201cbut we think it is an apt illustration of the downside scenario for the ultimate fate of Viacom.\u201d Thomas E. Dooley, chief operating officer of Viacom, called the criticism outdated, saying the company\u2019s programming remained in high demand. Just this week, Viacom announced that it had struck distribution agreements with the streaming service Hulu and AT&T, which recently acquired the satellite provider DirecTV. Mr. Dooley said that ratings at some Viacom channels like Nickelodeon have shown signs of improvement and that the company has installed new leadership at other channels like MTV. He pointed to a 23 percent increase in Viacom\u2019s stock price since its ebb at the end of August. \u201cThere is certainly a major perception change in the fate and the future of Viacom since those early August days,\u201d he said.He added that Viacom is not alone in the challenges it is faces on Wall Street. Broader fears about the future of the traditional television business have led to a sell-off of shares of media stocks in recent months. Further complicating the picture for Viacom are questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s health and involvement at the company, as well as uncertainty over what will happen after he is no longer chairman. In May, Mr. Redstone issued a statement saying that the decision over succession at the company would be made by the board, not an individual, and that such a decision had not yet been made. (Mr. Redstone also is the chairman and controlling shareholder at CBS, which faces similar questions about succession.)Some Viacom executives said that Mr. Redstone continued to monitor the company\u2019s stock price, swam every day and remained his usual feisty self. They said he communicated by taking a breath, swallowing twice, then speaking five or six words.Yet others close to the company have raised questions about that depiction. Mr. Redstone has not been spotted publicly since a 92nd birthday party in Los Angeles in May. He did not attend the company\u2019s annual stockholders meeting in March. A regular participant on company conference calls, Mr. Redstone has not spoken on one since November 2014.The board, which includes several executives known to be close to Mr. Redstone, has effectively endorsed Viacom\u2019s leadership by signing off on paydays that rank at the top of executive compensation packages. Mr. Redstone\u2019s total compensation for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2014, was $13.2 million, while Mr. Dauman\u2019s was $44.3 million, up 19 percent from the previous year. During that same period, Viacom\u2019s net earnings were essentially flat and the stock price declined about 9 percent.In August, Viacom disclosed in a regulatory filing that Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was stepping down from the board because \u201chis obligations elsewhere had increased.\u201d In private conversations, however, Mr. Kraft is said to have expressed dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s direction, according to two people who spoke to him but requested anonymity because the conversations were not meant to be public. Meanwhile, Mr. Redstone\u2019s daughter, Shari Redstone, who is nonexecutive vice chairwoman of the board, is worried about the direction of Viacom, according to two people who spoke with her but requested anonymity because the conversations were private. Mr. Dauman, a reserved lawyer and Mr. Redstone\u2019s longtime confidant, was named chief executive of Viacom in 2006. On his watch, a number of executives and creative talent have left the company. Among the prominent departures was Van Toffler, a well-liked 28-year veteran who left his job as president of MTV Networks Music and Logo Group in April despite entreaties from Mr. Dauman that he stay. Coinciding with his departure was a major reorganization at Viacom that led to significant job cuts. On the screen, Comedy Central has said goodbye to three of its biggest stars: Jon Stewart, who ended his run as host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d and Stephen Colbert, who left to host \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS. John Oliver left to host a program on HBO.Mr. Dooley said that executives who have left were in charge when their networks experienced ratings declines. He added that the company frequently acts as a launching pad for stars. One example, he said, is Amy Schumer, who has a show on Comedy Central but recently made a movie and has a standup special on HBO.Viacom executives said spending on content totals more than $4 billion a year, of which original programming is \u201ca substantial part.\u201d The company also is investing in new audience measurements that count the digital viewership of its brands. MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards, for instance, drew an audience of 9.8 million this year, roughly half a million less than last year, according to Nielsen. But Viacom calculated more than 76 million views across TV and digital. At the same time, Viacom \u2014 which also owns networks like BET, Spike and VH1 \u2014 highlights the growth of its international business, efforts to make money on new forms of distribution, such as selling programing to mobile, and development of a stronger film slate.Viacom has struggled in Hollywood. To save money, the company\u2019s movie studio, Paramount Pictures, has dramatically slowed production \u2014 it released no films in the quarter ended in June. Among the six biggest studios, Paramount ranked last in North American market share for the last three years running, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data.The studio, run by Brad Grey, is now trying to increase production to 15 films annually (up from about a dozen) and start a television production business. But analysts are not particularly optimistic. On a conference call with clients in August, the media analyst Michael Nathanson noted that Paramount has operating margins of \u201cless than 3 percent.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s possible, and I don\u2019t understand why Viacom continues to own that company and the management of Paramount has a job.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Be Allowed to Invest in a Lawsuit?", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureBut in a Chicago courtroom on Oct. 26, the Bug will star in a multimillion-dollar dispute that represents a new frontier in the march of global capitalism. The nominal occasion is a paternity feud between two of the Bug\u2019s corporate parents, Miller UK, the equipment manufacturer based in Cramlington, England, and Caterpillar, the American construction-equipment giant that was once Miller\u2019s biggest customer. The themes of Miller UK v. Caterpillar are classics of the intellectual-property genre: greed, betrayal, bloodlines. But Miller\u2019s method of funding its side of the production is something new. Rather than paying its lawyers out of pocket, Miller has turned to a private firm to front the money for its legal costs: the Illinois-based Arena Consulting, which is headed by two brothers, Herbert and Douglas Lichtman. If Miller loses, Arena gets nothing. If it wins, Arena will get a share of the proceeds, which could run well into the tens of millions of dollars.This new form of lawsuit funding is called litigation finance. It lies at the crossroads of two Anglo-American tendencies. The first is our litigious side, in which we celebrate our equality before the law by dragging those who have wronged us before a judge. The second is our ingenious mercantilism, as demonstrated by our penchant for turning everything from church raffles to mortgages into marketable securities to be chopped up, bundled and resold. Like the celebrity bonds backed by royalties and popularized by David Bowie during the 1990s, litigation finance represents the expansion of securitization into hitherto virgin territory. Those involved in the practice argue that it allows smaller companies like Miller to afford a day in court. Detractors worry that it could give rise to a litigation arms race, with speculative money aggravating the already high costs of the American legal system.While the amount of litigation funded by outside financiers is still relatively small, the industry \u2014 which barely existed outside personal-injury cases until the mid-2000s \u2014 is growing rapidly, driven by increasingly permissive laws, the promise of high returns and hourly billing rates that run $500 or more for the largest and most sophisticated law firms. Between 2013 and 2014, Burford Capital, a public company traded in Britain, increased its lawsuit investments from $150 million to $500 million. During the same period, its profits rose by 89 percent, with a 61 percent net profit margin. The two-year-old Gerchen Keller, one of the industry\u2019s youngest funds, manages more than $840 million. With investor-backed war chests, plaintiffs are crossing borders to find the most favorable jurisdictions, and sometimes enlisting the help of foreign governments. Like equities and mortgages, lawsuits are making a transition from a private arrangement to a fully monetized asset class. The \u2018\u2018portfolio\u2019\u2019 held by IMF Bentham, an Australia-based funder, consists of 39 cases, which the firm values at just over $2 billion. United States lawmakers are beginning to ask questions. In August, two senators from the Judiciary Committee sent letters to major funders asking them for the names of the cases they had invested in and many details of their business dealings. The letter called litigation finance a \u2018\u2018burgeoning industry\u2019\u2019 that was \u2018\u2018largely unregulated and operates with no licensing or oversight.\u2019\u2019Larger companies, even those with their own in-house counsel, are selling off pieces of lawsuits to smooth out cash flow and offload risk. Juridica Investments, a Miami-based fund with $650 million under management, specializes in working with Fortune 500 companies, which make up 80 to 85 percent of its investments, according to Richard Fields, its chief executive, who says that outside funding helps align the interests of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers with those of their clients. \u2018\u2018You want the largest recovery, in the shortest time, with the least uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 he says. Smaller companies can use litigation financing to finance growth, by using their future award as a credit line.Over the last century, many have come to see lawsuits as a means of expression, a political weapon and a powerful deterrent against those who might do wrong. And yet creating lawsuits is not the same as creating something like the Bug. Litigation is a zero-sum industry \u2014 every dollar in damages taken home by the winner, minus fees, must be wrung out of the loser. Litigation also helps shape legal precedent, defining the terms under which civil justice may be sought. It\u2019s hard to imagine how billions in outside capital won\u2019t wind up changing the justice system. The only question is how.\u2018\u2018How many people want to be changing that all day?\u2019\u2019 Ridley asked.Ridley then tapped out the other pin, climbed up into the Komatsu\u2019s cab and revved the diesel engine up to a gentle hum. He swung the yellow arm over to the Bug and positioned it within the flanges so the four holes aligned. He connected some hydraulic hoses to deliver power to the Bug\u2019s innards and tapped the two pins back in. Then, using the Bug-enhanced Komatsu, Ridley picked the bucket back up. Thanks to the Bug, it was an idiotproof process. A bright yellow safety latch tightened neatly over one of the pins. It took less than 10 seconds.Before quick couplers, operators would waste 30 minutes or more each time they wanted to switch out a bucket or other tool. Miller\u2019s first quick coupler, nicknamed the Magnificent Seven, came to market in the early 1990s, reducing that time to seven seconds. They also solved another problem. Previously, a construction company with three kinds of machines would need to buy three lines of buckets to match. Quick couplers soon created universal compatibility among product lines: A Komatsu bucket, for example, could now be slapped onto a Volvo machine.Caterpillar soon took notice. Compared with Miller, Cat is a leviathan: It\u2019s one of the 200 largest corporations in the world, with more than 100,000 employees. In 1997, according to legal filings from Miller, Cat approached a Miller executive at a trade show in Germany. The two companies began to talk about having Miller contract to supply Cat with a fully automatic coupler that the companies ultimately brought to market as the Pin Grabber Plus. Over the years, Cat (by Miller\u2019s count) bought about 27,000 of these units for resale to its own customers, generating upward of $100 million in revenue. Each generation of couplers had to mesh perfectly with the specifications of Cat\u2019s machines, so the companies\u2019 engineers exchanged technical drawings, and their executives hobnobbed over dinners in North\u00adumberland and Illinois. By 2006, Caterpillar was ordering about 10,000 Miller couplers a year. According to Miller, Caterpillar orders accounted for as much as 28 percent of its business and a larger share of its profits.Then, in the midst of the 2008 downturn, Cat, according to Miller\u2019s version of events, abruptly told Miller that its couplers would no longer be needed. Cat had designed its own coupler in-house. (Cat\u2019s filings deny that its coupler used Miller\u2019s proprietary technology and say that it was allowed to terminate its contract with Miller at any time.) Keith Miller, the company\u2019s founder, was gutted. With the loss of his largest customer, Miller earnings swung from an eight-million-pound profit to a million-pound loss. Miller took on debt and dismissed more than half of its employees.A year after Cat broke the news, Keith Miller saw its competing coupler for the first time. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t just similar,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It was a replica of ours.\u2019\u2019 Miller felt certain that the new Cat couplers made use of his company\u2019s know-how. He sued Caterpillar for breach of contract, fraud and misappropriating trade secrets. But he quickly learned what it means to sue a company as large as Cat. Caterpillar\u2019s lawyers made dozens of preliminary filings. They claimed that Miller had delivered \u2018\u2018substandard\u2019\u2019 couplers and failed to address \u2018\u2018continuity of supply\u2019\u2019 issues that it had repeatedly raised.Miller\u2019s lawyers quickly went through millions of pounds. To make it through the discovery phase of the suit would require millions more. Keith and his two siblings, who own the com\u00adpany together, mortgaged their houses and signed personal guarantees on the company\u2019s debt. But still they didn\u2019t have enough money to see their case through to court. So a contact in London introduced them to Reed Oslan, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in litigation finance.In the legal world, the Miller lawsuit is what is known as a \u2018\u2018David and Goliath\u2019\u2019 case, in which a plaintiff is so outgunned financially that it wouldn\u2019t be able to have its day in court without a lawyer willing to work on contingency or an infusion of investor cash. The Davids come in a variety of guises. Patricia Cohen, ex-wife of the billionaire hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, got a reported $1.2 million war chest from a firm called Balance Point, which specializes in funding divorce cases like hers. In 2006, 16 years after their divorce, Patricia saw a \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 report on her ex-husband\u2019s business, which led her to file a lawsuit accusing Cohen of racketeering and fraud, claiming that he concealed $5.5 million during their legal proceedings. In 2014, after a string of findings and appeals, a federal judge dismissed the racketeering portion of Patricia\u2019s claim, noting that the only difference between it and other family disputes was \u2018\u2018the seemingly inexhaustible resources that each side has brought to bear,\u2019\u2019 but he allowed Patricia to continue her case against Steven for fraud and other claims. The litigious aftermath of the Cohen divorce, he noted, had persisted for twice as long as the Cohen marriage. Gerald Lefcourt, Patricia Cohen\u2019s lawyer, said that outside financing was necessary for Patricia to challenge someone with the resources of her ex-husband. \u2018\u2018The average person who has a good job making $100,000 a year is middle class, but totally shut out of the legal system,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t fight a big case. How do you do it?\u2019\u2019Terms of the deal between Miller UK and its funders have not been disclosed, but funders typically acquire the rights to 20 to 60 percent of all damages in hopes of recouping two or three times their original investment, sometimes more. This month, when Miller UK Ltd. v. Caterpillar Inc. is scheduled to reach trial in a federal court in Chicago, Miller\u2019s lawyers will ask a jury to award Miller more than $100 million. \u2018\u2018As the boss, I have to find a way forward,\u2019\u2019 Keith Miller said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re just a little business from the northeast of England. Without litigation finance, we couldn\u2019t take them on.\u2019\u2019Nevertheless, a vestigial squeamishness about investing in lawsuits made its way across the Atlantic. The first such disputes, early in the 20th century, were over contingency fees, the practice, now common, of lawyers taking on a case in exchange for a percentage of future damages. Unlike England, which still caps fees for winning solicitors, America was open to this kind of payment structure, in keeping with its frontier ethic toward credit and speculation. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit champerty, as long as funders do not act out of malice, back frivolous lawsuits or exert too much control over trial strategy.Hedge funds, banks and insurance companies have long been quietly funding the occasional lawsuit, but no major United States investment outfit in the commercial arena specialized in the practice until Juridica was founded in 2007. The industry\u2019s early growth was driven in part by the recession, which made lawyers at big companies eager to hand off risk and also increased the demand among investors for opportunities that could pay off no matter what was happening in the world\u2019s markets. Today the industry seems to have become a permanent part of the financial landscape, with shares of prominent funders trading every day on stock exchanges in London and Sydney.Anthony Sebok, a professor at Cardozo Law who advises Burford, says he sees the practice as part of a broader trend toward the financialization of the law. \u2018\u2018Why can\u2019t I promise a stranger some piece of the game?\u2019\u2019 he asked me, paraphrasing Bentham\u2019s writings. \u2018\u2018Is there something icky about it, like I\u2019m commodifying my rights? Bentham says these legal rights are our property. Why shouldn\u2019t we be able to sell them?\u2019\u2019 Jonathan Molot, a professor at Georgetown Law who serves as Burford\u2019s chief investment officer, has written that stock offerings by law firms could improve morale, lower rates and help lawyers focus on maximizing long-term profits. Like lawsuits, the firm itself should evolve into an asset. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a mistake for lawyers to hunker down and say we\u2019re different, we\u2019re excluded, we\u2019re not part of the economy,\u2019\u2019 he said.But the interests of financiers and plaintiffs are not always so well aligned. Depending on the structure of the deal and the ultimate payout, plaintiffs sometimes walk away with a few crumbs after the funders and lawyers take their share. One such outcome happened in 2007, when Altitude Capital, a funder, invested $8 million in an intellectual-property suit filed by DeepNines, a small network security company, against McAfee, a much larger competitor. The case was settled for $25 million, but after expenses ($2.1 million), lawyers\u2019 fees (roughly $11 million) and Altitude\u2019s cut ($10 million), DeepNines took home $800,000, a little over 3 percent of its settlement. Then, Altitude questioned DeepNines\u2019 math, arguing that the company shouldn\u2019t have deducted its own expenses before calculating contingency fees. It sued its former partner for $5 million more, eventually dropping the suit in 2011.This kind of falling out is unusual, but it shows the fundamental conflict that can occur. When it\u2019s time to divvy up the prizes, allies can turn into competitors, and smaller, inexperienced plaintiffs can find themselves facing down a second Goliath \u2014 their former champion.Lisa Rickard, the institute\u2019s president, calls litigation finance \u2018\u2018the biggest single threat to the integrity of our justice system.\u2019\u2019 As evidence, she put me in touch with Howard Schrader, a lawyer for Ace Limited, a $35 billion insurance company engaged in a multifront legal battle over a grievance dating back to the Liberian Civil War of 1991. At its root was the question of whether a Liberian company run by Lebanese nationals was due an insurance settlement over a looted supermarket, or whether the damage fell under a war-risk exclusion in its insurance policy that ruled out \u2018\u2018insurrection.\u2019\u2019 The plaintiff was a Liberian official, represented by a lawyer from the British Virgin Islands, who had found outside investors and sued in a Cayman Islands court to enforce a Liberian judgment. Schrader spent more than an hour speaking with me by phone, dutifully walking me through the case and peeling back mind-numbing layers of acquisitions, indemnity agreements, receiverships and jurisdictional disputes. To Rickard, the Ace Limited case was an example of buccaneering funders tracking down far-flung plaintiffs to pick at old wounds. I wasn\u2019t so sure. On one hand, a giant Swiss insurance company felt it was being shaken down. On the other, a small business felt it was due something for paying years of premiums. I had trouble feeling too sorry for either.In another long-running legal battle, which began in Ecuador and has since spread to several other jurisdictions, Steven Donziger, a Harvard Law School-educated lawyer, has pursued Chevron with an Ahab-like single-mindedness. He has donned the hats of advocate, adviser and ad hoc fund-raiser for some 30,000 indigenous Ecuadorians who live around the Lago Agrio area and claim that Texaco, which Chevron acquired, left contaminated waste pits around old oil-drilling sites on their land. In 2010, after the case had gone on for 19 years and Donziger\u2019s team had gone through $7 million, Burford bought in. They invested $4 million, with another $11 million planned. In exchange for its support, Burford would receive 5.5 percent of the settlement, which could work out to a 100-to-1 jackpot should Chevron pay $27 billion in damages, an ambitious sum calculated by a court-appointed expert.Chevron went on offense, digging up outtakes from a documentary in which Donziger extols the suit as an act of \u2018\u2018brute force\u2019\u2019 and the purpose of plaintiffs\u2019 law as \u2018\u2018to make [expletive] money.\u2019\u2019 (Donziger has said that these excerpts are \u2018\u2018grossly misleading or lacking in context.\u2019\u2019)In September 2011, Burford sent Donziger a letter ending their relationship. They accused his team of \u2018\u2018fraudulent conduct\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018deception,\u2019\u2019 citing Donziger\u2019s communications with the supposedly impartial expert who had come up with the $27 billion settlement figure. Burford said that consultants working with Donziger\u2019s team had \u2018\u2018ghost written\u2019\u2019 the expert\u2019s report and \u2018\u2018worked very hard to cover that up.\u2019\u2019 Donziger, meanwhile, has continued his crusade against Chevron in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. \u2018\u2018You cannot sustain this kind of case without money, and a lot of money,\u2019\u2019 Donziger said in 2010. You can imagine Chevron\u2019s being more inclined to settle had Donziger taken a less ambitious approach. Considering that scenario, it\u2019s arguable that Burford\u2019s investment could have been part of what has kept those 30,000 Ecuadorians \u2014 Donziger\u2019s clients \u2014 from receiving one penny in damages, more than 20 years after Texaco left their area. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that Donziger could not continue to pursue Chevron in the United States. Donziger has appealed and continues his foreign lawsuits. Chevron calls the case against the company \u2018\u2018the legal fraud of the century.\u2019\u2019Not long ago I had breakfast with Christopher Bogart, Burford\u2019s C.E.O. He is in early middle age, and his well-tended appearance and subtly asymmetric eyeglasses signal prosperity. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve done more than 100 deals,\u2019\u2019 he said, speaking of the Chevron case. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t had another one that\u2019s gone that way.\u2019\u2019 Burford, Bogart told me, never anticipated a $27 billion payout. \u2018\u2018We believed that Chevron would settle for much less than that,\u2019\u2019 he said, perhaps $1 billion, a more modest 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 win.\u2018\u2018The case illustrates something that I think all lawyers know,\u2019\u2019 he continued. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t always get all of the facts from your client.\u2019\u2019 His tone was somewhere between resignation and remorse, like a banker who had made a bad bet.Of course, the transformation of legal disputes into deals didn\u2019t begin with litigation finance. For years, observers of the legal profession have criticized how the market economy erodes its ethical obligations, pushing private advantage over public good and billable hours above all. Only the truly rich can afford to hire a professional who will zealously and exhaustively defend their interests. When litigation financiers talk about expanding access to justice and standing up for the little guy, they generally mean helping millionaires pursue claims against billionaires. In some ways, the rise of litigation finance is a symptom of what the American civil-justice system has become \u2014 a slow, expensive and complicated system for mediating corporate breakups. The judges in this system might talk like referees, but their function is moving toward that of accountants.\u2018\u2018All we want to do is set the record straight about what happened and why,\u2019\u2019 he told me.An initial skirmish in Miller v. Caterpillar involved a major question for litigation finance as a whole \u2014 should plaintiffs be forced to disclose their funding arrangements, or are they entitled to keep these deals confidential? Lisa Rickard, from the Institute for Legal Reform, argues in favor of disclosure. \u2018\u2018That helps the judge and the defendant understand who\u2019s pulling the strings,\u2019\u2019 she told me.Judge Jeffrey Cole, who is presiding over the Miller case, disagreed. He called champerty \u2018\u2018a hoary doctrine\u2019\u2019 that time had \u2018\u2018narrowed to a filament.\u2019\u2019 Many of the particulars of Miller\u2019s financial dealings with its backers, Cole found, are irrelevant, as they \u2018\u2018have nothing to do with the claims or defenses in the case.\u2019\u2019 Miller could keep the specifics of how it was financing its lawsuit confidential.If Cole\u2019s ruling is any indication, the day is approaching when lawsuits are something like the Bug itself \u2014 complicated, expensive and eminently transferable commodities. More and more lawyers will find themselves being paid by people whose interest in the outcome is speculative, not personal. Somewhat like mortgage banking, lawyering will involve serving as a buffer between the people who care and the people who manage the probabilities.Like most entrepreneurs, Keith Miller is a bit of both. His feelings about Caterpillar\u2019s treatment of the Bug haven\u2019t stopped him from continuing to sell the company some of Miller\u2019s smaller products. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re hand-to-mouth each month,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Quite frankly, we\u2019re not in a position to turn anything down.\u2019\u2019 Could he ever imagine repairing Miller\u2019s relationship with Cat? \u2018\u2018I\u2019d be delighted to do that,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018So long as we\u2019re reimbursed for our losses.\u2019\u2019An article on Oct. 25 about litigation finance misstated the amount of money managed by the firm Gerchen Keller. It has more than $840 million under management, not $475 million in private capital.Advertisement"}

At the midpoint of its expected price range, the company would be valued at about $16.7 billion.First Data\u2019s owner, the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, took the company private during the leveraged buyout boom eight years ago.Still, in going public, First Data will become one of the last major leveraged buyouts to hit the public markets and help its owner make an exit. Private equity firms have rushed to hold initial offerings for their companies over the last five years, spurred on by huge gains in the stock markets.Some significant buyout targets still remain privately held. Among them are Clear Channel Communications, the broadcaster now rebranded as iHeartMedia, and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which K.K.R. bought with Bain Capital and Vornado.First Data is going public at a relatively quiet time for initial offerings. About 138 I.P.O.s have priced so far this year, down 35 percent from last year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. And those stock sales that were successfully completed have not performed particularly well, on average falling about 5 percent from their offering price.Another company held by private equity firms, Surgery Partners, priced its initial offering well below an expected price range on Wednesday, though the surgical center operator may have suffered from a general decline in health care stocks.Investors and analysts have long awaited the return of First Data, which claims some 4,000 financial institutions as clients and an ability to process more than 2,300 transactions a second.Yet the company has been moving beyond credit card payments as the industry has grown more competitive, with PayPal and Total System Services rolling out their own offerings.K.K.R. is expected to remain First Data\u2019s biggest shareholder though the company\u2019s sale of new shares will reduce the private equity firm\u2019s stake to roughly 60 percent from 75 percent.First Data will use its share of the proceeds from the I.P.O. to pay down debt.The company is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange around the middle of the month, under the ticker symbol \u201cFDC.\u201dIts offering is being led by Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and K.K.R.\u2019s own capital markets arm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lonely Death of George Bell", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "Each year around 50,000 people die in New York, some alone and unseen. Yet death even in such forlorn form can cause a surprising amount of activity. Sometimes, along the way, a life\u2019s secrets are revealed.Supported byThey found him in the living room, crumpled up on the mottled carpet. The police did. Sniffing a fetid odor, a neighbor had called 911. The apartment was in north-central Queens, in an unassertive building on 79th Street in Jackson Heights.The apartment belonged to a George Bell. He lived alone. Thus the presumption was that the corpse also belonged to George Bell. It was a plausible supposition, but it remained just that, for the puffy body on the floor was decomposed and unrecognizable. Clearly the man had not died on July 12, the Saturday last year when he was discovered, nor the day before nor the day before that. He had lain there for a while, nothing to announce his departure to the world, while the hyperkinetic city around him hurried on with its business.Neighbors had last seen him six days earlier, a Sunday. On Thursday, there was a break in his routine. The car he always kept out front and moved from one side of the street to the other to obey parking rules sat on the wrong side. A ticket was wedged beneath the wiper. The woman next door called Mr. Bell. His phone rang and rang.Then the smell of death and the police and the sobering reason that George Bell did not move his car.Each year around 50,000 people die in New York, and each year the mortality rate seems to graze a new low, with people living healthier and longer. A great majority of the deceased have relatives and friends who soon learn of their passing and tearfully assemble at their funeral. A reverent death notice appears. Sympathy cards accumulate. When the celebrated die or there is some heart-rending killing of the innocent, the entire city might weep.A much tinier number die alone in unwatched struggles. No one collects their bodies. No one mourns the conclusion of a life. They are just a name added to the death tables. In the year 2014, George Bell, age 72, was among those names.Like most New Yorkers, he lived in the corners, under the pale light of obscurity.Yet death even in such forlorn form can cause a surprising amount of activity, setting off an elaborate, lurching process that involves a hodgepodge of interlocking characters whose livelihoods flow in part or in whole from death.With George Bell, the ripples from the process would spill improbably and seemingly by happenstance from the shadows of Queens to upstate New York and Virginia and Florida. Dozens of people who never knew him, all cogs in the city\u2019s complicated machinery of mortality, would find themselves settling the affairs of an ordinary man who left this world without anyone in particular noticing.In discovering a death, you find a life story and perhaps meaning. Could anything in the map of George Bell\u2019s existence have explained his lonely end? Possibly not. But it was true that George Bell died carrying some secrets. Secrets about how he lived and secrets about who mattered most to him. Those secrets would bring sorrow. At the same time, they would deliver rewards. Death does that. It closes doors but also opens them.The officers from the 115th Precinct called the medical examiner\u2019s office, which involves itself in suspicious deaths and unidentified bodies, and a medical legal investigator arrived. His task was to rule out foul play and look for evidence that could help locate the next of kin and identify the body. In short order, it was clear that nothing criminal had taken place (no sign of forced entry, bullet wounds, congealed blood).A Fire Department paramedic made the obvious pronouncement that the man was dead; even a skeleton must be formally declared no longer living. The body was zipped into a human remains pouch. A transport team from the medical examiner\u2019s office drove it to the morgue at Queens Hospital Center, where it was deposited in one of some 100 refrigerated drawers, cooled to 35 degrees.It falls to the police to notify next of kin, but the neighbors did not know of any. Detectives grabbed some names and phone numbers from the apartment, called them and got nothing: The man had no wife, no siblings. The police estimate that they reach kin 85 percent of the time. They struck out with George Bell.At the Queens morgue, identification personnel got started. Something like 90 percent of the corpses arriving at city morgues are identified by relatives or friends after they are shown photographs of the body. Most remains depart for burial within a few days. For the rest, it gets complicated.The easiest resolution is furnished by fingerprints; otherwise by dental and medical records or, as a last resort, by DNA. The medical examiner can also do a so-called contextual ID; when all elements are considered, none of which by themselves bring certainty, a sort of circumstantial identification can be made.Fingerprints were taken, which required days because of the poor condition of the fingers. Enhanced techniques had to be used, such as soaking the fingers in a solution to soften them. The prints were sent to city, state and federal databases. No hits.Each county in New York City has a public administrator to manage estates when there is no one else to do so, most commonly when there is no will or no known heirs.Public administrators tend to rouse attention only when complaints flare over their competence or their fees or their tendency to oversee dens of political patronage. Or when they run afoul of the law. Last year, a former longtime counsel to the Bronx County public administrator pleaded guilty to grand larceny, while a bookkeeper for the Kings County public administrator was sentenced to a prison term for stealing from the dead.Recent audits by the city\u2019s comptroller found disturbing dysfunction at both of those offices, which the occupants said had been overstated. The most recent audit of the Queens office, in 2012, raised no significant issues.The Queens unit employs 15 people and processes something like 1,500 deaths a year. Appointed by the Queens surrogate, Lois M. Rosenblatt, a lawyer, has been head of the office for the past 13 years. Most cases arrive from nursing homes, others from the medical examiner, legal guardians, the police, undertakers. While a majority of estates contain assets of less than $500, one had been worth $16 million. Meager estates can move swiftly. Bigger ones routinely extend from 12 to 24 months.The office extracts a commission that starts at 5 percent of the first $100,000 of an estate and then slides downward, money that is entered into the city\u2019s general fund. An additional 1 percent goes toward the office\u2019s expenses. The office\u2019s counsel, who for 23 years has been Gerard Sweeney, a private lawyer who mainly does the public administrator\u2019s legal work, customarily gets a sliding legal fee that begins at 6 percent of the estate\u2019s first $750,000.\u201cYou can die in such anonymity in New York,\u201d he likes to say. \u201cWe\u2019ve had instances of people dead for months. No one finds them, no one misses them.\u201dThe man presumed to be George Bell joined the wash of cases, a fresh arrival that Ms. Rosenblatt viewed as nothing special at all.Meanwhile, the medical examiner needed records \u2014 X-rays would do \u2014 to confirm the identity of the body. The office took its own chest X-rays but still required earlier ones for comparison.The medical examiner\u2019s office had no idea which doctors the man had seen, so in a Hail Mary maneuver, personnel began cold-calling hospitals and doctors in the vicinity, in a pattern that radiated outward from the Jackson Heights apartment. Whoever picked up was asked if by chance a George Bell had ever dropped in.On July 24, two investigators, Juan Plaza and Ronald Rodriguez, entered the glutted premises of the Bell apartment, clad in billowy hazmat suits and bootees. Investigators work in pairs, to discourage theft.Bleak as the place was, they had seen worse. An apartment so swollen with belongings that the tenant, a woman, died standing up, unable to collapse to the floor. Or the place they fled swatting at swarms of fleas.Yes, they saw a human existence that few others did.Mr. Plaza had been a data entry clerk before joining his macabre field in 1994; Mr. Rodriguez had been a waiter and found his interest piqued in 2002.What qualified someone for the job? Ms. Rosenblatt, the head of the office, summed it up: \u201cPeople willing to go into these disgusting apartments.\u201dThe two men foraged through the unedited anarchy, 800 square feet, one bedroom. A stench thickened the air. Mr. Plaza dabbed his nostrils with a Vicks vapor stick. Mr. Rodriguez toughed it out. Vicks bothered his nose.The only bed was the lumpy foldout couch in the living room. The bedroom and bathroom looked pillaged. The kitchen was splashed with trash and balled-up, decades-old lottery tickets that had failed to deliver. A soiled shopping list read: sea salt, garlic, carrots, broccoli (two packs), \u201cTV Guide.\u201dThe faucet didn\u2019t work. The chipped stove had no knobs and could not have been used to cook in a long time.The men scavenged for a will, a cemetery deed, financial documents, an address book, computer, cellphone, those sorts of things. Photographs might show relatives \u2014 could that be a mom or sis beaming in that picture on the mantel?Portable objects of value were to be retrieved. A Vermeer hangs on the wall? Grab it. Once they found $30,000 in cash, another time a Rolex wedged inside a radio. But the bar is not placed nearly that high: In one instance, they lugged back a picture of the deceased in a Knights of Malta outfit.In the slanting light they scooped up papers from a table and some drawers in the living room. They found $241 in bills and $187.45 in coins. A silver Relic watch did not look special, but they took it in case.Fastened to the walls were a bear\u2019s head, steer horns and some military pictures of planes and warships. Over the couch hung a photo sequence of a parachutist coming in for a landing, with a certificate recording George Bell\u2019s first jump in 1963. Chinese food cartons and pizza boxes were ubiquitous. Shelves were stacked with music tapes and videos: \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d \u201cYule Log.\u201dA splotched calendar from Lucky Market hung in the bathroom, flipped open to August 2007.Hoarding is deemed a mental disorder, poorly understood, that stirs people to incoherent acts; sufferers may buy products simply to have them. Amid the mess were a half-dozen unopened ironing board covers, multiple packages of unused Christmas lights, four new tire-pressure gauges.The investigators returned twice more, rounding up more papers, another $95. They found no cellphone, no computer or credit cards.Rummaging through the personal effects of the dead, sensing the misery in these rooms, can color your thoughts. The work changes people, and it has changed these men.Mr. Rodriguez, 57 and divorced, has a greater sense of urgency. \u201cI try to build a life like it\u2019s the last day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know when you will die. Before this, I went along like I would live forever.\u201dThe solitude of so many deaths wears on Mr. Plaza, the fear that someday it will be him splayed on the floor in one of these silent apartments. \u201cThis job teaches you a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn whatever material stuff you have you should use it and share it. Share yourself. People die with nobody to talk to. They die and relatives come out of the woodwork. \u2018He was my uncle. He was my cousin. Give me what he had.\u2019 Gimme, gimme. Yet when he was alive they never visited, never knew the person. From working in this office, my life changed.\u201dHe is 52, also divorced, and without children, but he keeps expanding his base of friends. Every day, he sends them motivational Instagram messages: \u201cWith each sunrise, may we value every minute\u201d; \u201cBe kind, smile to the world and it will smile back\u201d; \u201cShare your life with loved ones\u201d; \u201cLove, forgive, forget.\u201dHe said: \u201cWhen I die, someone will find out the same day or the next day. Since I\u2019ve worked here, my list of friends has gotten longer and longer. I don\u2019t want to die alone.\u201dHe began with the pictures. Mr. Stressler mingles in the leavings of people he can never meet and especially likes to ponder the photographs so \u201cyou get a sense of a person\u2019s history, not that they just died.\u201dThe snapshots ranged over the humdrum of life. A child wearing a holster and toy pistols. A man in military dress. Men fishing. A young woman sitting on a chair in a corner. A high school class on a stage, everyone wearing blackface. \u201cDifferent times,\u201d Mr. Stressler mused.In the end, the photos divulged little of what George Bell had done across his 72 years.The thicket of papers yielded a few hazy kernels. An unused passport, issued in 2007 to George Main Bell Jr., showing a thick-necked man with a meaty face ripened by time, born Jan. 15, 1942. Documents establishing that his father \u2014 George Bell \u2014 died in 1969 at 59, his mother, Davina Bell, in 1981 at 76.Some holiday cards. Several from an Elsie Logan in Red Bank, N.J., thanking him for gifts of Godiva chocolates. One, dated 2001, said: \u201cI called Sunday around 2 \u2014 no answer. Will try again.\u201d A 2007 Thanksgiving Day card read, \u201cI have been trying to call you \u2014 but no answer.\u201dA 2001 Christmas card signed, \u201cLove always, Eleanore (Puffy),\u201d with the message: \u201cI seldom mention it, but I hope you realize how much it means to have you for a friend. I care a lot for you.\u201dCards from a Thomas Higginbotham, addressed to \u201cBig George\u201d and signed \u201cfriend, Tom.\u201dA golden find: H&R Block-prepared tax returns, useful for divining assets. The latest showed adjusted gross income of $13,207 from a pension and interest, another $21,311 from Social Security. The bank statements contained the biggest revelation: For what appeared to be a simple life, they showed balances of several hundred thousand dollars. Letters went out to confirm the amounts.No evidence of stocks or bonds, but a small life insurance policy, with the beneficiaries his parents. And there was a will, dated 1982. It split his estate evenly among three men and a woman of unknown relation. And specified that George Bell be cremated.Using addresses he found online, Mr. Stressler sent out form letters asking the four to contact him. He heard only from a Martin Westbrook, who called from Sprakers, a hamlet in upstate New York, and said he had not spoken with George Bell in some time. The will named him as executor, but he deferred to the public administrator.Loose ends began to be tidied up. The car, a silver 2005 Toyota RAV4, was sent to an auctioneer. There was a notice advising that George Bell had not responded to two juror questionnaires and was now subpoenaed to appear before the commissioner of jurors; a letter went out saying he would not be there. He was dead.If an apartment\u2019s contents have any value, auction companies bid for them. When they don\u2019t, \u201ccleanout companies\u201d dispose of the belongings. George Bell\u2019s place was deemed a cleanout.Among his papers was an honorable military discharge from 1966, following six years in the United States Army Reserve. A request was made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, national cemetery administration, in St. Louis, for burial in one of its national cemeteries, with the government paying the bill.St. Louis responded that George Bell did not qualify as a veteran, not having seen active duty or having died while in the Reserves. The public administrator appealed the rebuff. A week later, 16 pages came back from the centralized satellite processing and appeals unit that could be summed up in unambiguous concision: No.Another thing the public administrator takes care of is having the post office forward the mail of the deceased. Statements may arrive from brokerage houses. Letters could pinpoint the whereabouts of relatives. When magazines show up, the subscriptions are ended and refunds requested. Could be $6.82 or $12.05, but the puny sums enter the estate, pushing it incrementally upward.Not much came for George Bell: bank statements, a notice on the apartment insurance, utility bills, junk mail.When someone dies destitute and forsaken, and one of various free burial organizations does not learn of the case, the body ends up joining others in communal oblivion at the potter\u2019s field on Hart Island in the Bronx, the graveyard of last resort.If there are funds, the public administrator honors the wishes of the will or of relatives. When no one speaks for the deceased, the office is partial to two fairly dismal, cut-rate cemeteries in New Jersey. It prefers the total expense to come in under $5,000, not always easy in a city where funeral and burial costs can be multiples of that.Simonson Funeral Home in Forest Hills was picked by Susan Brown, the deputy public administrator, to handle George Bell once his identity was verified. It is among 16 regulars that she rotates the office\u2019s deaths through.George Bell\u2019s body was hardly the first to be trapped in limbo. Some years ago, one had lingered for weeks while siblings skirmished over the funeral specifics. The decedent\u2019s sister wanted a barbershop quartet and brass band to perform; a brother preferred something solemn. Surrogate\u2019s Court nodded in favor of the sister, and the man got a melodious send-off.The medical examiner was not having any luck with George Bell. The cold calls to doctors and hospitals continued, but as the inquiries bounced around Queens, the discouraging answers came back slowly and redundantly: no George Bell.In the interim, the medical examiner filed an unverified death certificate, on July 28. The cause of death was determined to be hypertensive and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with obesity a significant factor. This was surmised, based on the position in which the body was found, its age, the man\u2019s size and the statistical likelihood of it being the cause. Occupation was listed as unknown.City law specifies that bodies be buried, cremated or sent from the city within four days of discovery, unless an exemption is granted. The medical examiner can release even an unverified body for burial. Absent a corpse\u2019s being confirmed, however, the policy of the medical examiner is not to allow cremation. What if there has been a mistake? You can\u2019t un-cremate someone.So days scrolled past. Other corpses streamed through the morgue, pausing on their way to the grave, while the body presumed to be George Bell entered its second month of chilled residence. Then its third.Grandma\u2019s Attic Cleanouts was sent over to remove the offending appliance. Diego Benitez, the company\u2019s owner, showed up with two workers.The refrigerator was unplugged, with unfrozen frozen vegetables and Chinese takeout rotting inside. Roaches had moved in. Mr. Benitez doused it with bug spray. He plugged it in to chill the food and rid it of the smell, then cleaned it out and took it to a recycling center in Jamaica. A few weeks later, Wipeout Exterminating came in and treated the whole place.Meanwhile, the medical examiner kept calling around hunting for old X-rays. In late September, the 11th call hit pay dirt. A radiology provider had chest X-rays of George Bell dating from 2004. They were in a warehouse, though, and would take some time to retrieve.Weeks tumbled by. In late October, the radiology service reported: Sorry, the X-rays had been destroyed. The medical examiner asked for written confirmation. Back came the response: Never mind, the X-rays were there. In early November, they landed at the medical examiner\u2019s office.The X-rays were compared, and bingo. In the first week of November, nearly four months after it had arrived, the presumed corpse of George Bell officially became George Bell, deceased, of Jackson Heights, Queens.At the morgue, an attendant withdrew the body from the drawer, and both medical examiner and undertaker checked the identity tag. Using a hydraulic lift, the attendant swung the body into the wooden coffin. George Bell was at last going to his eternal home.The coffin was wheeled out and guided into the back of the hearse. Mr. Sommese smoothed an American flag over it. The armed forces had passed on a military burial, but George Bell\u2019s years in the Army Reserves were good enough for the funeral director, and he abided by military custom.Next stop was U.S. Columbarium at Fresh Pond Crematory in Middle Village, for the cremation. Mr. Sommese made good time along the loud streets lined with shedding trees. The volume on the radio was muted; the dashboard said Queen\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was playing.While the undertaker said he didn\u2019t dwell much on the strangers he transported, he allowed how instances like this saddened him \u2014 a person dies and nobody shows up, no service, no one from the clergy to say a few kind words, to say rest in peace.The undertaker was a Christian, and believed that George Bell was already in another place, a better place, but still. \u201cI don\u2019t think everyone should have an elaborate funeral,\u201d he said in a soft voice. \u201cBut I think burial or cremation should be with respect, or else what is society about? I think about this man. I believe we\u2019re all connected. We\u2019re all products of the same God. Does it matter that this man should be cremated with respect? Yes, it does.\u201dHe consulted the mirror and blended into the next lane. \u201cYou can have a fancy funeral, but people don\u2019t pay for kindness,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey don\u2019t pay for understanding. They don\u2019t pay for caring. This man is getting caring. I care about this man.\u201dAt U.S. Columbarium, he steered around to the rear, to the unloading dock. Another hearse stood there. Yes \u2014 a line at the crematory.Squinting in the sun, Mr. Sommese paced in the motionless air. After 15 minutes, the dock opened up and the undertaker angled the hearse in. Workers took the coffin. Mr. Sommese kept the flag. Normally, it would go to the next of kin. There being none, the undertaker folded it up to use again.The cremation process, what U.S. Columbarium calls the \u201cjourney,\u201d consumed nearly three hours. Typically, cremains are ready for pickup in a couple of days. For an extra $180, the columbarium provides same-day express service, which was unneeded in this case.Some 40,000 cremains were stored at the columbarium, almost all of them tucked into handsome individual wall niches, viewable through glass. Downstairs was a storage area near the bathrooms with a bronze tree affixed to the door. This was the Community Tree. Behind the door cremains were stacked up and stored out of sight. The budget alternative. Names were etched on the tree leaves. Some time ago, when the leaves filled up, doves were added.Several days after the cremation, the superintendent stacked an urn shaped like a small shoe box inside the storage area. Then he nailed a metal dove, wings spread, above the right edge of the tree. It identified the new addition: \u201cGeorge M. Bell Jr. 1942-2014.\u201dIn the frosty gloom of Dec. 30, as a hissing wind spun litter through the air, the Maltz company had among its cars a 2011 Mustang convertible, multiple Mercedes-Benzes, two cars that didn\u2019t even run and George Bell\u2019s 2005 Toyota. Despite its age, it had just over 3,000 miles on it, brightening its appeal.In a one-minute bidding spasm \u2014 \u201c3,000 the bid, 3,500, 35 the bid, 4,000\u2026\u201d \u2014 the car went for $9,500, beating expectations. After expenses, $8,631.50 was added to the estate. The buyer was Sam Maloof, a regular, who runs a used car dealership, Beltway Motor Sales, in Brooklyn and planned to resell it. After he brought it back, his sister and secretary, Janet Maloof, adored it. She had the same 2005 model, same color, burdened with over 100,000 miles. So, feeling the holiday spirit, he gave her George Bell\u2019s car.In a couple of weeks, the only other valuable possession extracted from the apartment, the Relic watch, came up for sale at a Maltz auction of jewelry, wine, art and collectibles. The auction was dominated by 42 estates put up by the Queens public administrator, the thinnest by far being George Bell\u2019s. Bidding on the watch began at $1 and finished at $3. The winner was a creaky, unemployed man named Tony Nik. He was in a sulky mood, mumbling after his triumph that he liked the slim price.Again after expenses, another $2.31 trickled into the Bell estate.On a sun-kindled day a week later, six muscled men from GreenEx, a junk removal business, arrived to empty the cluttered Queens apartment. Dispassionately, they scooped up the dusty traces of George Bell\u2019s life and shoveled them into trash cans and bags. They broke apart the furniture with hammers. Tinny music poured from a portable radio.Eyeing the bottomless thickets, puzzling over what heartbreak they told of, one of the men said: \u201cDepression, I think. People get depressed and then, Lord help them, forget about it.\u201dSeven hours they went at it, flinging everything into trucks destined for a Bronx dump where the rates were good.Some nuggets they salvaged for themselves. One man fancied a set of Marilyn Monroe porcelain plates. Another worker plucked up an unopened jumbo package of Nike socks, some model cars and some brand-new sponges. Yet another claimed the television and an unused carbon monoxide detector. Gatherings from a life, all worth more than that $3 watch.A spindly worker with taut arms crouched down to inspect some never-worn tan work boots, still snug in their box. They were a size big, but he slid them on and liked the fit.He cleaned George Bell\u2019s apartment wearing the dead man\u2019s boots.Elizabeth Rooney, a kinship investigator in the office of Gerard Sweeney, the public administrator\u2019s counsel, set out to help find them. By law, she also had to hunt for the next of kin, down to a first cousin once removed, the furthest relative eligible to lay claim to an estate. They had to be notified, should they choose to contest the will.There was time, for George Bell\u2019s assets could not be distributed until seven months after the public administrator had been appointed, the period state law specifies for creditors to step forward.Prowling the Internet, Ms. Rooney learned that Mr. Murzi and Mr. Schober were dead. Mr. Westbrook was in Sprakers and Mr. Higginbotham in Lynchburg, Va. Ms. Rooney found Ms. Albert, now going by the name Flemm, upstate in Worcester.They were surprised to learn that George Bell had left them money. Ms. Flemm had spoken to him by phone a few weeks before he died; the others had not been in touch for years.A core piece of Ms. Rooney\u2019s job was drafting a family tree going back three generations. Using the genealogy company Ancestry.com, she compiled evidence with things like census records and ship manifests, showing Bell relatives arriving from Scotland. Her office once produced a family tree that was six feet long. Another time it traced a family back to Daniel Boone.Ms. Rooney created paternal and maternal trees, each with dozens of names. She found five living relatives: two first cousins on his mother\u2019s side, one living in Edina, Minn., and the other in Henderson, Nev. Neither had been in contact with George Bell in decades, and didn\u2019t know what he did for a living.On the paternal side, Ms. Rooney identified two first cousins, one in Scotland and another in England, as well as a third whose whereabouts proved elusive.When that cousin, Janet Bell, was not found, protocol dictated that a notice be published in a newspaper for four weeks, a gesture intended to alert unlocated relatives. With sizable estates, the court chooses The New York Law Journal, where the bill for the notice can run about $4,000. In this instance the court picked The Wave, a Queens weekly with a print circulation of 12,000, at a cost of $247.The cousin might have been in Tajikistan or in Hog Jaw, Ark., or even on Staten Island, and the odds of her spotting the notice were approximately zero. Among thousands of such ads that Mr. Sweeney has placed, he is still awaiting his first response.Word came that Eleanore Flemm had died of a heart attack, on Feb. 3 at 66. Since she had outlived Mr. Bell, her estate would receive her proceeds. Her heirs were her brother, James Albert, a private detective on Long Island who barely remembered the Bell name, along with a nephew and two nieces in Florida. One did not know George Bell had existed.Death, though, isn\u2019t social. It\u2019s business. No need to have known someone to get his money.On Feb. 20, a Queens real estate broker listed the Bell apartment at $219,000. It was the final asset to liquidate. Three potential buyers toured it the next day, and one woman\u2019s offer of $225,000 was accepted.Three months later, the building\u2019s board said no. A middle-aged couple who lived down the block entered the picture, and, at $215,000, was approved. Their plan was to fix up the marred apartment, turn their own place over to their grown-up son and then move in, overwriting George Bell\u2019s life.Meanwhile, Mr. Sweeney appeared in Surrogate\u2019s Court to request probate of the will. Besides the two known beneficiaries, he listed the possibility of unknown relatives and the unfound cousin. The court appointed a so-called guardian ad litem to review the will on behalf of these people, who might, in fact, be phantoms.In September, Mr. Sweeney submitted a final accounting, the hard math of the estate, for court approval. No objections arrived. Tallied up, George Bell\u2019s assets amounted to roughly $540,000. Bank accounts holding $215,000 listed Mr. Higginbotham as the sole beneficiary, and he got that directly. Proceeds from the apartment, other accounts, a life insurance policy, the car and the watch went to the estate: around $324,000.A commission of $13,726 went to the city, a $3,238 fee to the public administrator, $19,453 to Mr. Sweeney.Other expenses included things like the apartment maintenance, at $7,360; a funeral bill of $4,873; $2,800 for the cleanout company; $1,663 for the kinship investigator; a $222 parking ticket; a $704 Fire Department bill for ambulance service; $750 for the guardian ad litem; and $12.50 for an appraisal of the watch that sold for $3.That left about $264,000 to be split between Mr. Westbrook and the heirs of Ms. Flemm. Some 14 months after a man died, his estate was settled and the proceeds were good to go.For the recipients, George Bell had stepped out of eternity and united them by bestowing his money. No one in the drawn-out process knew why he had chosen them, nor did they need to. They only needed to know him in the quietude of death, as a man whose heart had stopped beating in Queens. But he had been like anyone, a human being who had built a life on this earth.After high school, he joined his father as an apprentice. In 1961, he made an acquaintance at a local bar, a moving man. They became friends, and the moving man pulled George Bell into the moving business. His name was Tom Higginbotham. Three fellow movers also became friends: Frank Murzi, Albert Schober and Martin Westbrook. The men in the will. They mainly moved business offices, and they all guzzled booze, in titanic proportions.\u201cWe were a bunch of drunks,\u201d Mr. Westbrook said. \u201cI\u2019m a juicer. But George put me to shame. He was a real nice guy, kind of a hermit. Boy, we had some good times.\u201dIn the words of Mr. Higginbotham: \u201cWe were great friends. I don\u2019t know if you can say it this way, but we were men who loved each other.\u201dThey called him Big George, for he was a thickset, brawny man, weighing perhaps 210 pounds. Later, his ravenous appetite had him pushing 350.He had a puckish streak. Once a woman invited him and Mr. Higginbotham to a party at her parents\u2019 house. Her father kept tropical fish. She showed George Bell the tank. When he admired a distinctive fish, she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s an expensive one.\u201d He picked up a net, caught the fish and swallowed it.One day the friends were moving a financial firm. After they had fitted the desks into the new offices, George Bell slid notes into the drawers, writing things like: \u201cI\u2019m madly in love with you. Meet me at the water cooler.\u201d Or: \u201cThere\u2019s a bomb under your chair. Your next move might be your last.\u201dDumb pranks. Big George being Big George.Friends, though, found him difficult to crack open. There were things inside no one could get out. You learned to suppress your questions around him.He had his burdens. His father died young. As she aged, his mother became crippled by arthritis. He cared for her, fetching her food and bathing her until her death.He was fastidious about his money, only trusted banks for his savings. There was a woman he began dating when she was 19 and he was 25. \u201cWe got real keen on each other,\u201d she said later. \u201cHe made me feel special.\u201dA marriage was planned. They spoke to a wedding hall. He bought a suit. Then, he told friends, the woman\u2019s mother had wanted him to sign a prenuptial agreement to protect her daughter if the marriage should break apart. He ended the engagement, and never had another serious relationship.That woman was Eleanore Albert, the fourth name in the will.Some years later, she married an older man who made equipment for a party supply company, and moved upstate to become Ms. Flemm. In 2002, her husband died.Distance and time never dampened the emotional affinity between her and George Bell. They spoke on the phone and exchanged cards. \u201cWe had something for each other that never got used up,\u201d she said. She had sent him a Valentine\u2019s Day card just last year: \u201cGeorge, think of you often with love.\u201dAnd unbeknown to her, he had put her in his will and kept her there.Her life finished up a lot like his. She lived alone, in a trailer. She died of a heart attack. A neighbor who cleared her snow found her. She had gotten obese. Her brother had her cremated.A difference was that she left behind debt, owed to the bank and to credit card companies. All that she would pass on was tens of thousands of dollars of George Bell\u2019s money, money that she never got to touch.Some would filter down to her brother, who had no plans for it. A slice went to Michael Garber, her nephew, who drives a bus at Disney World. A friend of his aunt\u2019s had owned a Camaro convertible that she relished, and he might buy a used Camaro in her honor.Some more would go to Sarah Teta, a niece, retired and living in Altamonte Springs, Fla., who plans to save it for a rainy day. \u201cYou always hear about people you don\u2019t know dying and leaving you money,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought it would happen to me.\u201dAnd some would funnel down to Eleanore Flemm\u2019s other niece, Dorothy Gardiner, a retired waitress and home health care aide. She lives in Apopka, Fla., never heard of George Bell. She has survived two cancers and has several thousand dollars in medical bills that could finally disappear. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying off $25 a month, what I can,\u201d she said. \u201cI never would have expected this. It\u2019s crazy.\u201dHe used to have buddies over to watch television and he would cook for them. Then he stopped having anyone over. No one knew why.Old friends had drifted away, and with them some of the fire in George Bell\u2019s life. Of his moving man colleagues, Mr. Murzi retired in 1994 and died in 2011. Mr. Schober retired in 1996 and moved to Brooklyn, losing touch. He died in 2002.Mr. Higginbotham quit the moving business, and moved upstate in 1973 to work for the state as an environmental scientist.He is now 74, retired and living alone in Virginia. The last time he spoke to George Bell was 10 years ago. He used a code of ringing and hanging up to get him to answer his phone, but in time, he got no answer. He sent cards, beseeched him to come and visit, but he wouldn\u2019t. It was two months before Mr. Higginbotham found out George Bell had died.It has been hard for him to reconcile the way George Bell\u2019s money came to him. \u201cI\u2019ve been stressed about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping. My stomach hurts. My blood pressure is up. I argued with him time and again to get out of that apartment and spend his money and enjoy life. I sent him so many brochures on places to go. I thought I understood George. Now I realize I didn\u2019t understand him at all.\u201dMr. Higginbotham was content with the fundaments of his own life: his modest one-bedroom apartment, his 15-year-old truck. He put the inheritance into mutual funds and figures it will help his three grandchildren through college. George Bell\u2019s money educating the future.In 1994, Mr. Westbrook hurt his knee and left the moving business. He moved to Sprakers, where he had a cattle farm. When he got older and his marriage dissolved, he sold the farm but still lives nearby. He is 74. It was several years ago that he last spoke to George Bell on the phone. Mr. Bell told him he did not get out much.He has three grandchildren and wants to move to a mellower climate. He plans to give some of the money to Mr. Murzi\u2019s widow, because Mr. Murzi had been his best friend.\u201cMy sister needs some dental work,\u201d he said. \u201cI need some dental work. I need hearing aids. The golden age ain\u2019t so cheap. Big George\u2019s money will make my old age easier.\u201dHe felt awful about his dying alone, nobody knowing. \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll happen to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a loner, too. There\u2019s maybe four or five people up here I talk to.\u201dIn his final years, with the moving men gone, George Bell\u2019s life had become emptier. Neighbors nodded to him on the street and he smiled. He told lively stories to the young woman next door, who lived with her parents, when he bumped into her. She recently became a police officer, and she was the one who had smelled what she knew was death.But in the end, George Bell seemed to keep just one true friend.He had been a fixture at a neighborhood pub called Budds Bar. He showed up in his cutoff blue sweatshirt so often that some regulars called him Sweatshirt Bell. At one point, he eased up on his drinking, then, worried about his health, quit. But he still went to Budds, ordering club soda.In April 2005, Budds closed. Many regulars gravitated to another bar, Legends. George Bell went a few times, then transferred his allegiance to Bantry Bay Publick House in Long Island City. He would meet his friend there.In the early 1980s, not long after moving to Jackson Heights, he stopped in at Budds in need of a restroom. A big man had bellowed, \u201cHave a beer.\u201dThat was George Bell. In time, a friendship was spawned, deepening during the 15 years that remained of George Bell\u2019s life. They met on Saturdays at Bantry Bay. They fished in the Rockaways and at Jones Beach, sometimes with others. Mr. Bell bought a car to get out to the good spots, but the car otherwise mostly sat. They passed time meandering around, the days bleeding into one another.\u201cWhere did we go?\u201d Mr. Bertone said. \u201cNo place. One time we sat for hours in the parking lot of Bed Bath & Beyond. What did we talk about? The world\u2019s problems. Just like that, the two of us solved the world\u2019s problems.\u201dMr. Bertone is 67, a retired inspector for Consolidated Edison. Over the last decade, he had spent more time with George Bell than anyone, but he didn\u2019t feel he truly knew him.\u201cOne thing about George is he didn\u2019t get personal,\u201d he said. \u201cNot ever.\u201dHe knew he had never married. He spoke of girlfriends, but Mr. Bertone never met any. The two had even swapped views on wills and what happens to your money in the end, though Mr. Bertone did not know George Bell had drafted a will before they met.Mr. Bertone would invite him to his place, but he would beg off. George Bell never had him over.Once, some eight years ago, Mr. Bertone trooped out there when he hadn\u2019t heard from him in a while. George Bell cracked open the door, shooed him away. A curtain draped inside the entryway had camouflaged the chaos. Mr. Bertone had no idea that at some point, George Bell had begun keeping everything.The Dude, Mr. Bertone, told a story. A few years ago, George Bell was going into the hospital for his heart and had asked him to hold onto some money. Gave him a fat envelope. Inside was $55,000.Mike Kerins, a bartender, interrupted: \u201cTwo things about George. He gave me $100 every Christmas, and he never went out to eat.\u201d He had confessed he was too embarrassed because he would have required three entrees.George Bell had diabetes and complained about a shoulder pain. He took pills but skipped them during the day, saying they made him feel like an idiot.Both the Dude and Mr. Kerins sensed he felt he had been bullied too hard by life. \u201cGeorge was in a lot of pain,\u201d Mr. Kerins said. \u201cI think he was just waiting to die, had lived enough.\u201dIt was as if sadness had killed George Bell.His days had become predictable, an endless loop. He stayed cloistered inside. Neighbors heard the regular parade of deliverymen who brought him his takeout meals.The last time the Dude saw George Bell was about a week before his body was found. Frozen shrimp was on sale at the shopping center. George Bell got some, to take back to the kitchen he did not use.Mr. Bertone didn\u2019t realize he had died until someone came to Legends with the news. Mr. Kerins was there and he told the Dude. They made some calls to find out more, but got nowhere.Why did he die alone, no one knowing?The Dude thought on that. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could tell you. But I don\u2019t know.\u201dOn the televisions above the busy bar, a woman was promoting a cleaning product. In the dim light, Mr. Bertone emptied his drink. \u201cYou know, I miss him,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have liked to see George one more time. He was my friend. One more time.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the transporting of George Bell\u2019s body. It is shown being taken to a crematorium, not to a morgue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slump in Trading Hurts Goldman Sachs Earnings", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in the third quarter, it was Goldman that underperformed.The Wall Street firm said on Thursday that both its revenue and its profit declined more sharply than expected as the bank struggled with volatility in the financial markets.It was a tough quarter for most big banks, which were hobbled by the market turmoil set off in August by China\u2019s economic slowdown. But Goldman\u2019s third-quarter results were even worse than its competitors\u2019.At the huge trading desks of Goldman\u2019s biggest competitor, JPMorgan Chase, revenue fell 11 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. At Goldman, the decline was 34 percent.Goldman was hit particularly hard by the large investments it held in its own portfolio \u2014 a part of the bank that had generally done well in recent years.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Revenue from its so-called investing and lending division dropped 60 percent from the same quarter a year ago and 63 percent from the previous quarter. Goldman said that was caused by a decline in the price of the public stocks it held.Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Harvey M. Schwartz, acknowledged the difficulties, but he defended the company\u2019s long-term strategy, which has been to stick with difficult businesses as other competitors scale back.\u201cWe are keenly aware of the challenges facing the industry,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said in a call with analysts Thursday morning. \u201cWe believe that our long-term prospects are quite favorable.\u201dThe bank\u2019s analysts, though, expressed concern that its strategy was not playing out as expected. Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI, noted during the call that the dynamics in the industry would seem to be working in Goldman\u2019s favor.\u201cIt feels like actually the world that you talked about was coming your way, but yet, the revenue reduction for Goldman is more pronounced,\u201d Mr. Schorr said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to do the smell test and wonder, why is that? I would think there would be more opportunities, not less.\u201dMr. Schwartz cautioned Mr. Schorr and other analysts against focusing too much on the results of a single quarter and comparing Goldman with competitors.\u201cWe don\u2019t see as much value in comparing revenues,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cIf you really look to the quarter-to-quarter noise, you run the risk of over-steering the business.\u201dGoldman has been cutting costs to adjust to the difficult environment in which it is operating. The amount set aside for compensation and bonuses in the latest quarter was down 16 percent from a year ago and 38 percent from the previous quarter.Those numbers, and similar ones from other banks, suggest that end-of-year bonuses across Wall Street will probably be disappointing this year and build on the declines that have already been seen in recent years.That could be particularly true because the cuts to bonuses so far have not kept up with the decline in revenue, at least at Goldman. Total revenue at the bank fell 18 percent from a year earlier, to $6.9 billion, compared with the $7.1 billion expected by analysts.Profit fell 38 percent, to $1.3 billion, or $2.90 a share, in the third quarter from the quarter a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $2.91 a share.Shares of Goldman ended Thursday up just over 3 percent.Some analysts seemed willing to accept Mr. Schwartz\u2019s argument that the lagging quarterly results should not be viewed as a long-term danger for the firm, particularly given its continuing cost-cutting.Christian Bolu, an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to clients that the pessimism surrounding Wall Street banks would, for Goldman, provide a \u201cfavorable setup\u201d for the beginning of next year, when results typically strengthen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With EMC Deal, Dell Returns to Public Markets", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorOn the surface, Dell\u2019s $67 billion buyout of EMC would seem to be all about going private. But this enormous tech deal also means the return of Dell to the public markets, just a few short years after the company fled them.That people have missed this point is not surprising, since Dell has not trumpeted it. But a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity has confirmed that Dell will essentially become a public company with its acquisition of EMC.The reason is the tracking stock that Dell will issue as part of the transaction. EMC owns roughly 81 percent of VMware, which before the announcement of the deal had a market value of more than $35 billion. Dell could not afford to buy all of EMC, including the interest in VMware. So instead, Dell is paying the cash consideration and issuing a tracking stock to EMC shareholders.It\u2019s a neat trick. By issuing this tracking stock, Dell can afford to buy EMC, something it otherwise couldn\u2019t, and still keep control of VMware.But there are costs here, and that is where the going public part comes in.But tracking stocks were unwieldy beasts and created legal issues as companies struggled to reconcile the fact they controlled and owned a company but had to pay heed to the holders of the tracking stock, which really was a share of the company itself. For example, a business decision hurting the business subject to the tracking stock to the greater benefit of the whole company could be challenged by the holders of the tracking stock.Dell\u2019s tracking stock solves some of these issues. It is not based on a business, but rather simply tracks VMware shares. And again, it is not even an interest in VMware stock, but instead is stock in Dell with the only rights to the proceeds of any sale of VMware shares or any dividends paid on VMWare shares. It does not raise the same legal issues as a stock that tracks an entire subsidiary.But since a tracking stock like this will be a class of Dell\u2019s own stock and publicly held, this will mean that Dell is about to become a public company. It will have to register the tracking stock (which is really just Dell stock) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More important, Dell will again be subject to all of the disclosure requirements of being public. (The company already does disclose some financial information confidentially to its debtholders.)Dell will have to disclose its financials and other information about the company and file quarterly and yearly reports. Again, this is because the tracking stock is really stock in Dell that gives the holder the right to all of the profits from the VMware stock held by Dell. And so Dell must report all of its information.So Dell is triumphantly, if not quite openly, returning to the public markets. The only difference is that Dell\u2019s equity will be controlled by Michael Dell, Silver Lake and the rest of the buyout group. There will be no pesky shareholder to deal with who can influence this group. Still, it will be interesting how the public spotlight on Dell\u2019s results changes views of the company. And despite Michael S. Dell\u2019s complaints about operating in the public markets, it clearly couldn\u2019t have been so bad for Dell if it is so quickly returning.It remains to be seen what happens with this tracking stock in the future. The arrangement gives Dell control of VMware for the foreseeable future and allows Dell to include VMware in its one-stop-shopping strategy, the reason it is buying EMC in the first place. In addition, it may be difficult to unwind the tracker even to arrange an exchange of tracking stock for actual VMware stock on a tax-efficient basis. It means that VMware is not going to be bought out any time soon, the reason its shares fell almost 10 percent when the deal was announced.On the flip side, Dell may have to buy out the tracking stock at some point if it wants to fully regain control of VMware. This will have to wait until Dell has more cash. But still, even then Dell may choose not to do so given that right now it will have control of VMware without having to pay tens of billions of dollars. The only price really is that Dell is back in the public eye, and that seems to be a cost Dell is willing to bear.Welcome back to the stock market, Dell. We missed you.An earlier version of this column gave outdated numbers for the holders of the VMware tracking stock when the EMC acquisition is completed. The tracking stock will be equivalent to 53 percent of VMware, not 65 percent; the combined Dell-EMC would retain 28 percent of VMware, not 17 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Morgan Stanley Investment Veteran\u2019s Advice for Rookies", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfWhen it comes to investing, keep your emotions in check. Otherwise, you will become your own worst enemy.Whatever you do, never try to time the market.And there is no shame in needing help managing your money. Figure out if you do and choose your adviser carefully.Mr. Spooner explains his simple reason for writing the book: After the death of his wife of 45 years in 2011, he felt as if he was starting his life over again, but this time equipped with more resources.Mr. Spooner, who is now 77, was 29 when he married. Thinking back to his younger self, Mr. Spooner writes, \u201cI\u2019m struck by how much I was clueless about at the time.\u201dNow, \u201cwith some accumulated assets and many years of observing human nature\u201d behind him, he spells out what he wishes he had known back then.The lessons are contained in a series of short essays that all end in a moral. For example:\u25a0 When you are just starting out, take a small portion of your investment portfolio and make decisions yourself. If you are happy with the results, keep going. If you are not, get help.\u25a0 If you are going to hire a financial adviser, ask about both investment philosophy and where that adviser\u2019s money is invested.\u25a0 Pay attention to the strictly legal kind of insider trading. Corporate insiders \u2014 officers and directors of a company \u2014 are required to report when they buy and sell shares of their company. The fact they are selling may or may not be a sign that you want to, too, Mr. Spooner writes. Insiders may be selling to diversify their holdings. But, he says, if they are buying more, pay attention. It is quite likely a sign that they are bullish on their company\u2019s future.When it comes to money, Mr. Spooner\u2019s overall message that you are responsible for your financial future is a good one, and his tone is supportive. Whether readers will respond to the rest of the book is strictly a matter of taste.As the subtitle suggests, he is eager to provide not just financial advice but \u201clife lessons\u201d as well. I found some of those less compelling. While the idea of doing things that make you stand out at work is a solid thought, I have my doubts about ideas like joining clubs early in life.Mr. Spooner\u2019s reasoning is this: \u201cIf you live someplace for a long time you can build up enemies as well as friends\u201d and you want to apply for membership before people want to keep you out. The moral: \u201cJoin clubs early in life, before a list grows of people who would exclude you.\u201dMost people I know in their late 20s or early 30s are more worried about getting their adult life underway than they are about being blackballed at the local country club.Still, even that advice is consistent with another of his themes: \u201cPlan for the worst case, not the best, in business and in life.\u201dThat, certainly, is good advice for everyone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Struggling Economy Finds \u2018Abenomics\u2019 Is Not an Easy Fix", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s economy has contracted so many times in the last few years that the meaning of recession has started to blur. If an economy is shrinking almost as often as it is growing, what does any single downturn say about its health?Now Japan appears to be faltering again.\u201cThe potential growth rate is close to zero, so any small shock can put the economy into recession,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, the chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cGrowth expectations are anemic.\u201dAs a result, some economists are betting that the Bank of Japan, which has been pumping vast amounts of money into the economy by buying up government debt, will pull the trigger on more stimulus at its next board meeting on Friday.The central bank\u2019s aggressive intervention has been central to Mr. Abe\u2019s policies, widely known as Abenomics. But events have conspired to blunt its impact.Last year, it was an ill-timed sales tax increase, which rattled Japanese consumers and dissuaded them from spending. Lately it has been the deceleration in China, whose factories have been important buyers of Japanese-made machinery.But the more fundamental problem, many specialists say, is that Japan\u2019s economy simply doesn\u2019t grow much in the first place.Baseline growth is essentially zero. Gross domestic product is the same size it was in the mid-1990s, in part because the work force is shrinking. So where a faster-moving economy might simply lose momentum in response to headwinds, Japan\u2019s goes into reverse.So far, Mr. Abe\u2019s policies have done little to change the dynamic.\u201cOverseas investors appear increasingly disillusioned with Abenomics,\u201d Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, said last week after a series of meetings with clients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in Asia.Foreign investors\u2019 enthusiasm for Abenomics was a central force in driving up Japanese stock prices, one of the few clear-cut successes of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic program. Although the rally has lost steam in the last few months along with other global markets, the Nikkei 225 is still about twice the level it was when Mr. Abe took office at the end of 2012.Other parts of the economy look weaker. One of Abenomics\u2019 central objectives, to generate a strong and sustained rise in consumer prices, \u201cremains very elusive,\u201d Mr. Baba said, as do its goals of raising workers\u2019 incomes and dismantling regulatory hurdles to business.Taken together, improvements in these areas were supposed to bolster the economy\u2019s metabolism and increase its underlying potential to grow.But the Fed has cut back its bond-buying program in response to a recovering American economy, and it is now considering whether to raise its benchmark interest rate from close to zero. A move by the Japanese central bank would go in the opposite direction \u2014 toward even looser monetary policy.The Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting this week will coincide with a twice-yearly update of board members\u2019 forecasts for growth and inflation, which are likely to show increased pessimism. Mr. Kuroda timed his last blast of stimulus with the same October review last year, catching the markets by surprise. Stocks in Japan and around the world jumped.Mr. Kuroda has been doing his best to lower expectations, insisting that the bank\u2019s current monetary settings are sufficient. Inflation has been held back by falling oil prices, he says, but the underlying direction of prices and wages is upward.\u201cI think the current policy, so-called qualitative and quantitative easing, has been working, having the intended impact on the economy,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC on Oct. 11, at a meeting of global central bankers in Lima.Mr. Kuroda misdirected markets with similar talk before his unexpected move last year. But he may face greater constraints to action this time around. Stimulus measures by the central bank tend to drag down the value of the yen. That is good for multinational companies that earn revenue abroad, but it risks angering Japan\u2019s trading partners, as well as Japanese consumers and small businesses, whose buying power declines with the currency.This month, Japan and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, including the United States, reached a hard-won agreement on a sprawling trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Abe says the increased trade and investment flows it promises to generate are crucial to raising Japan\u2019s long-run growth rate. But the pact is subject to approval by each country\u2019s legislature, including the United States Congress, where some members have accused Japan of unfairly suppressing the value of the yen to gain a competitive advantage.\u201cForeign exchange policy is very tricky with T.P.P. in the balance,\u201d said Mr. Adachi of JPMorgan, who used to work at the Japanese central bank and understands the political sensitivities that can shape its nominally independent decisions. \u201cOrdinary households don\u2019t want to see a weaker yen, either,\u201d he added, noting that the government faces an election for the upper house of Parliament next year.Mr. Abe\u2019s economic team, normally a cheerleader for bolder central bank action, has also been unusually circumspect. \u201cThe Bank of Japan may not ease policy further any time soon,\u201d Finance Minister Taro Aso said in a recent interview with the public broadcaster NHK.Mr. Abe has continued to make ambitious promises. Last month, he set a goal of increasing Japan\u2019s nominal economic output to 600 trillion yen by 2020 or soon after \u2014 an increase of about 20 percent from the current level. He gave little indication of how an economy that has not grown in two decades could expand by a fifth in just a few years.Audacious pronouncements have been a hallmark of Abenomics from the start \u2014 part of what Mr. Kuroda has described as an effort to dispel Japan\u2019s \u201cdeflationary mind-set.\u201d But after three mostly lackluster years, its architects\u2019 credibility is being questioned by many, including their natural supporters in the business elite.\u201cI believe \u00a5600 trillion is an outrageous figure,\u201d Yoshimitsu Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said after Mr. Abe announced his goal. \u201cI see it as merely a political message.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Government to Sell Remaining Stake in Royal Mail", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government said on Monday that it would exit its remaining stake in the Royal Mail, the operator of Britain\u2019s postal service, following a successful sale of half its holdings this summer.The latest move to sell down the government\u2019s stake came two years after an initial public offering of stock in the Royal Mail in October 2013 and follows sharp criticism of the offering for not achieving the best value for taxpayers.The government holds just below a 14 percent stake in the company and plans to sell its remaining holdings in an offering to institutional investors.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, previously said the British government would use proceeds from the sale of its remaining stake as part of a series of measures to reduce the country\u2019s debt by \u00a34.5 billion.In October 2013, the government raised \u00a31.98 billion in the I.P.O., which was 24 times oversubscribed.On Monday, the Royal Mail\u2019s shares closed about 44 percent above its I.P.O. price in London trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anticipating a Mortgage Rate Increase", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesThe intense media focus on when the Federal Reserve will finally raise its benchmark interest rate above zero can be nerve-wracking for home buyers. Many might be wondering whether they should rush to close on a deal before a move by the Fed causes mortgage rates to climb. While it might be smart to expedite deals already in the works, those who aren\u2019t quite ready to buy shouldn\u2019t feel pressured. Mortgage rates are influenced by many factors, some of which can be controlled by borrowers to get a better deal. When the Fed does act, the effect is unlikely to be an immediate spike in mortgage rates, said Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist for Realtor.com. What\u2019s more likely, he said, is a gradual increase in rates totaling around half a percentage point over a 12-month period. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a direct strong relationship between the Fed\u2019s policy action and what rates have been doing,\u201d Mr. Smoke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at that zero policy level since the end of 2008, and since then the 30-year fixed rate has ranged from 3.31 to a high of 5.59. That\u2019s a pretty broad range independent of what the Fed was doing.\u201dOne could even argue that \u201crates could stay the same or possibly go down when the Fed moves,\u201d said Bob Walters, the chief economist for Quicken Loans, the online lender. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though the long-term rates move in lockstep with the federal funds rate, which is a very short-term rate. And when they do move, the market\u2019s not going to be surprised. A lot of that is anticipated.\u201d (The federal funds rate is the amount banks charge one another for overnight loans.) So instead of worrying about the Fed, borrowers might do better to concentrate on rate factors within their control. First and foremost is the type of loan they choose. Initial rates are significantly lower on adjustable-rate mortgages, called ARMs, relative to a 30-year fixed, but these loans may not make sense for buyers who plan to stay in their homes for more than five to seven years. As the rate adjusts, it could become less affordable. One way for home buyers who opt for a fixed-rate loan to drive down their rate is by paying points upfront \u2014 essentially prepaying interest. This strategy may make sense for buyers who can afford it and who plan to be in their homes for a long time, Mr. Walters said. Two other factors that influence rates are credit scores and down-payment levels. Credit scores, in particular, have a considerable effect. On a conventional mortgage, the span between rates offered to borrowers with lower FICO credit scores (in the 600s) versus high (750 or higher) can be as much as a percentage point, Mr. Walters said.Borrowers should also keep in mind that rates vary across lenders because of \u201call of their individual views of the level of risk and how much business they need to fill their pipeline,\u201d he added. \u201cIt pays to shop around.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Walters said, borrowers should be aware that rates are not static \u2014 a phone quote given in the morning could change by day\u2019s end. \u201cMortgage rates are just like stocks, in that mortgage-backed securities trade all day and rates are changing throughout the day based on what\u2019s happening in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo home buyers shouldn\u2019t assume it\u2019s a bait-and-switch or a scam when the quoted rate changes in a short period of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bernanke were to write a sequel to his recently published memoir, \u201cThe Courage to Act,\u201d he might well want to call it \u201cThe Courage Not to Act.\u201dFor that\u2019s what the Federal Reserve needs at its rate-setting meeting today and at least some of those to follow \u2014 the fortitude to resist the mounting pressure to raise interest rates from their near-zero level.To a significant clutch of Fed policy makers and the perennial chorus of inflation worriers have been added new voices, ranging from emerging-market countries feeling \u201cFed fatigue\u201d as their currencies gyrate with each round of speculation to leading businessmen to presidential hopefuls like Donald J. Trump.I stand with Ms. Brainard and Mr. Tarullo: The Fed should step back from its implicit commitment to raise rates this year and hold firm until there is clear evidence of inflationary conditions.Currently the economy is expanding at just over a 2 percent rate with little reason to expect improvement. Important sectors, from business investment to retail sales, are anemic.Should the economy once again sag, the Fed still has tools at its disposal, such as renewing its bond buying. And other policy makers could legislate tax cuts or spending increases.Indeed, in a better world, we would not even be relying so heavily on the central bank to stimulate our lagging economy; a more expansionary fiscal policy would also be playing a part.More balanced economic policies would also help address another criticism of low interest rates: their propensity to increase income inequality by inflating the value of stocks and other assets that are disproportionately owned by the wealthy.To conservatives, rising asset prices signal greater chances of another meltdown, similar to what occurred in the mid-2000s. But the stock market is down 3 percent since its peak in May. And housing prices have yet to return to pre-crisis levels.With 11.4 million new jobs, and no inflation in sight, perhaps we can agree that the Fed\u2019s full-throated efforts to stimulate the economy were a constructive contributor to our recovery.For nearly seven years, members of the Federal Open Market Committee have dutifully gathered every six weeks or so, pondered bits and bytes of economic data and decided not to change interest rates.Until the evidence indicating a need to begin raising rates becomes compelling, I\u2019m hoping that the inaction faction prevails over the action faction.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 1.5% Rate in Third Quarter", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAppearances can be deceiving.Even as the economy decelerated last quarter, mostly because of more cautious stockpiling by companies as economic turmoil overseas intensified, the American consumer kept right on spending. And most American businesses, in making their longer-term investment decisions, weren\u2019t far behind.While the overall rate of growth was a decidedly lackluster 1.5 percent last quarter, according to the Commerce Department report on Thursday, spending by consumers on goods like furniture and services like health care and insurance advanced at more than twice that pace.\u201cThe good news is that the important engine of personal consumption remains strong,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cThe headline data was slightly disappointing, but the persistent strength of personal consumption bodes well for a continued modest expansion in the U.S. economy.\u201dThe tempo of growth over the summer, which was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, represented a marked drop from the 3.9 percent pace of expansion in the spring.But the downshift was mostly the result of slower inventory accumulation as businesses let stockpiles of goods in warehouses and on store shelves unwind rather than making big additions as they did in the first half of 2015. Nonfarm inventories increased at half the rate they did in the second quarter, a reduction that shaved 1.44 percentage points off the overall figure for growth in the third quarter.Business activity presented a mixed picture \u2014 investment in equipment and intellectual property rose, but spending on structures fell, a trend experts attributed to cutbacks in the energy industry in response to the sharp decline in oil prices over the last 12 months.In addition to buoyant consumer activity, residential investment was also healthy, a sign that the housing market, after a long period of suffering, is now providing the economy with a fresh tailwind. Government spending also provided a small kick to growth.Stocks traded slightly lower, but bond yields ticked up, indicating that traders are once again leaning toward the view that the Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark interest rate in December.\u201cOutside of the inventory correction, this was a solid report,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cIt bolsters the case that we will see a bounceback in growth,\u201d he added, noting that his bank expecting a growth rate in the current quarter of about 2.5 percent.In terms of the drag from stockpiles, \u201ccompanies scaled back their expectations,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, but looking ahead to the final quarter this year, inventories \u201cshould diminish as a headwind.\u201dInflation also remained tame, according to the Commerce Department. The index for core consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter, well below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve.In a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the government reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to 260,000 last week, less than expected. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which can be more reliable than the week-to-week snapshot, fell to its lowest level since 1973 and suggested that hiring should be fairly strong.The pluses and minuses buried in the fine print of Thursday\u2019s reports on economic output and hiring highlight the contradictions that economists, Federal Reserve policy makers and ordinary consumers all have to contend with after more than six years of tepid economic growth.Some industries \u2014 technology, health care, finance \u2014 are enjoying conditions that echo the booming 1990s or the housing bubble of a decade ago.Things could not be more different, however, in areas of the economy that depend on commodity prices, like the oil and gas industry, which has been cutting jobs, reflecting a downturn in energy prices. Manufacturers that service those industries, like steel makers, have also felt a chill.Echoing this pattern, economic conditions are best on the coasts, led by places like New York, Boston, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Silicon Valley and the Seattle area, while broad areas of the once-thriving midsection of the country are now struggling.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of folks moving into the Bay Area getting jobs, and you see the growing pains that come with that, like traffic and housing affordability,\u201d Mr. Anderson, the economist at Bank of the West, said. \u201cThe incubator is the tech sector, but it\u2019s broader-based than that.\u201dAt the same time, he said, \u201cthe decline in energy and commodities is having a detrimental effect on growth from Texas north to Minnesota.\u201dThursday\u2019s report is the first of three estimates the government will make, and the numbers are bound to be revised upward or downward as more data comes in.Fed officials are still trying to determine when economic conditions will justify a long-anticipated increase in short-term interest rates, which the central bank has held near zero for nearly seven years.On Wednesday, as expected, the Fed left rates unchanged. But officials signaled that an increase could come when they meet in mid-December, especially if economic growth and employment pick up in the fourth quarter. The Labor Department will issue two monthly reports on the job market before that meeting, with the first, for October, to be released on Nov. 6.For the current quarter, experts are anticipating that the economy will bounce back as the drag from slower inventory-building fades. The consensus view today is for gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, to advance at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent, a little better than the overall performance of the economy since the Great Recession ended.\u201cThe Q3 G.D.P. report was soft with respect to the headline figure, but the underlying domestic demand data was in line with the pace seen in recent quarters,\u201d said Omair Sharif, rates strategist at SG Americas Securities. \u201cOn balance, this report probably does little to change the Fed\u2019s perception that the economy continues to advance at a \u2018moderate\u2019 pace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast Revenue Jumps 11%, Defying Media Gloom", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComcast reported on Tuesday an 11 percent increase in revenue, to nearly $18.7 billion, in the third quarter, fueled by continued growth in its high-speed Internet and film businesses.Three months ago, media stocks underwent a mass sell-off, prompted by fears of cord-cutting by customers who drop cable and satellite subscriptions, along with worries about steep ratings declines and weak advertising sales.Shares in many media companies, including Comcast, have largely rebounded, but broader concerns remain about the future of the business.Comcast is the largest cable operator in the country as well as the owner of the NBCUniversal television and film group, and its third-quarter earnings provide a window into the broader health of the media business.At least for now, those results point to less of a doomsday outlook than the one that swept the market in August, said Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie. \u201cThe business doesn\u2019t erode as quickly as the market thinks,\u201d she said.Other big media companies \u2014 Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner \u2014 are scheduled to report earnings next week.Brian L. Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, said the company had strong results despite broad technological changes reshaping the industry. He said that the company continued to grow by \u201cgiving consumers what they want and having a unique set of assets to do that.\u201dComcast has tried to keep pace with the rapid change by investing in its X1 technology system, which is aimed at transforming how people watch cable television. The X1 system accounted for about 60 percent of Comcast\u2019s video connections during the quarter.Hoping to appeal to a generation of customers who will pay for Internet service but have dropped cable packages, the company is also introducing a more selective service called Stream. Priced at $15 a month, it offers a bundle of broadcast networks and the premium cable network HBO without a broader cable package.NBCUniversal recently unveiled a new digital comedy streaming channel called Seeso that costs $4 a month and is free of advertising.During the third quarter, revenue in Comcast\u2019s cable group increased 6.3 percent, to $11.7 billion. The company lost 48,000 video subscribers during the quarter. But Comcast\u2019s high-speed Internet group continued to propel the business, adding 320,000 subscribers during the quarter.Comcast is just one piece of the pay TV business and it remains to be seen whether defections among subscribers accelerate during the third quarter. This year\u2019s second quarter was the industry\u2019s worst ever for pay TV subscriber losses, according to Craig Moffett, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research.Mr. Moffett said that cable operators like Comcast were stealing share from their satellite and telecom rivals. \u201cSome of that owes, no doubt, to cable\u2019s accelerating dominance in broadband,\u201d he said in a research note. \u201cBut some of it owes to the fundamental changes in the way we are watching TV.\u201dIn Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal entertainment group, revenue increased 20.8 percent during the quarter to nearly $7.2 billion. The film business, built around the Universal studio, continued to be a bright spot; revenue in the group was up 64 percent, to $1.9 billion, led by the box-office success of its films \u201cJurassic World\u201d and \u201cMinions.\u201dThe television business also reported stronger results. Broadcast television revenue was up 11.3 percent and cable network revenue was up 7 percent.Comcast\u2019s total net income was nearly $2 billion for the quarter, down 23 percent from the same period in 2014, the company said on Tuesday. The sharp decline resulted from one-time income tax adjustments that increased last year\u2019s third-quarter results by $724 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Stock Sinks After a Warning on Sales", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe news sent Walmart shares plunging, casting a pall over retail stocks, as analysts worried about broader ripple effects across the economy, and about consumer spending ahead of the holiday season.Walmart\u2019s slowing performance underscored concerns that its superstores, which once upended the way people shopped and for decades dominated the world of retail, are finally succumbing to nimbler rivals in the sprawling world of Internet commerce.Sales will be flat this year, Walmart said at a meeting with investors in New York. The retailer previously said that it expected net sales to grow 1 to 2 percent for the current fiscal year, through January.Shares in Walmart fell 10.04 percent to $60.03, their worst one-day slump in 17 years.Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said the company needed to invest to return to growth.\u201cWe can deliver stronger financial performance in the short term simply by running our core business better, but that won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Mr. McMillon said.In a bid to soften the blow, Walmart also announced a new $20 billion share buyback program. Still, Walmart, eclipsed by Amazon this year as the world\u2019s biggest retailer by market capitalization, lost more than $20 billion in market value as its shares fell to their lowest level in three years. So far this year, Walmart\u2019s shares are down 30 percent.\u201cRetail history is very clear,\u201d Mr. McMillon said. \u201cThose that are unwilling or unable to change go away. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking decisive steps now to change and grow our business.\u201dBurt P. Flickinger III, managing director of the Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point of demarcation. As of today, it\u2019s clear Amazon is clearly eclipsing Walmart as the No. 1 growth retailer for the next decade.\u201dWalmart\u2019s executives, Mr. Flickinger said, made many meaningful improvements, including finally pouring serious resources into its online and delivery operations. But as growth continues to stall, investors realized that even those efforts would fall short in the face of the fierce competition facing brick-and-mortar retailers.Walmart\u2019s woes sent ripple effects through the wider retail sector, as worries mounted over what is expected to be weak holiday spending this year.The National Retail Federation, a trade group, said last week that it expected sales in November and December to rise 3.7 percent to $630 billion, less than last year\u2019s 4.1 percent gain. Figures released by the Commerce Department earlier Wednesday showed overall retail sales virtually flat in September.Target shares fell 3.5 percent, while Dollar General slumped 4.2 percent. Sears fell 3.0 percent. \u201cAmazon\u2019s clearly winning the retail wars with its advanced robotics and so on,\u201d Mr. Flickinger said. \u201cWalmart is already a proverbial light year behind Amazon in online retailing.\u201dMr. McMillon acknowledged that competition with e-commerce juggernauts, as well as discounters, remained tough. But in a shot at Amazon, he defended the advantages of Walmart\u2019s large physical store over purely online merchants, asking whether it was easier for a brick-and-mortar store to build up e-commerce or for an e-commerce player to build out stores.Walmart\u2019s strength, he said, lay in giving consumers the choice of shopping at its superstores or its increasing number of smaller \u201cneighborhood\u201d stores, or online, with products available for in-store pickup or for home delivery. Only Walmart could provide that wide array of options at a huge, nationwide scale, he said.\u201cWe like our chances,\u201d Mr. McMillon said.Mr. McMillon also said he was willing to close stores that were underperforming, as well as sell assets. That prompted speculation over a potential spinoff of businesses, like Sam\u2019s Club, whose performance has lagged, as well as exits from difficult international markets.Though Walmart has bolstered growth in some markets overseas, like Mexico and Canada, it has struggled further afield, including in Britain, where Walmart\u2019s Asda chain has been engaged in a price war in a hypercompetitive grocery business.Walmart\u2019s growth in China and in Brazil has also lost steam as economies slowed in those markets. In the most recent quarter, net sales at Walmart\u2019s international stores fell by almost 10 percent.Walmart has said it is also addressing erratic scheduling practices that have come under fire from labor groups for the destabilizing effect it has on workers\u2019 incomes and livelihoods.But it still faces pressure to do more to improve the lot of its lowest-paid employees \u2014 including committing to raising pay to at least $15 an hour.\u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d one worker says. \u201cWe can\u2019t survive on these wages,\u201d says another.Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s departing chief financial officer, said earnings per share would fall 6 to 12 percent next year before they would recover. He said profits would rebound by fiscal year 2019, when earnings per share were expected to grow 5 to 10 percent a year.The company\u2019s executive vice president, Brett Biggs, is set to succeed Mr. Holley at the end of the year.Mr. Holley also said that the company expected sales to increase in a range of $45 billion to $60 billion over the next three years, the equivalent of the annual sales of many of the country\u2019s biggest corporations. The company trails Amazon by market capitalization, but Walmart\u2019s sales \u2014 which reached $482 billion last year \u2014 dwarf Amazon\u2019s annual revenue of about $89 billion.Walmart\u2019s size has not calmed investors\u2019 fears or translated into confidence in the retailer\u2019s future. Mr. McMillon acknowledged as much, telling investors in a question-and-answer session that the biggest and the best were not the same.Still, \u201cthis is a growth company,\u201d Mr. McMillion said. \u201cIt just happens to be a really large growth company.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}

The meeting may bring leadership changes, including in the military, which could reinforce President Xi Jinping\u2019s influence. The gathering is expected to begin drafting a new five-year plan, which will begin in 2016, that aims, in part, to make the currency more convertible and bring more market disciplines to state-owned enterprises.This is not the meeting you\u2019ve been waiting for.

The committee is expected to keep the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate near zero.Two reports come out on Tuesday that should give some sense of the American economy\u2019s momentum this fall, especially given headwinds from Asia and wobbles on Wall Street in August and September.First will be government data on durable goods orders for September \u2014 Wall Street is looking for a 1.3 percent decline, following a steeper drop in August. The headline figure is heavily influenced by volatile orders for aircraft, which are thought to have weakened last month. Economists will be looking at the underlying details to see if other sectors were stronger.On Tuesday, Apple reports earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street will continue to focus on sales of the iPhone, which account for the bulk of Apple\u2019s revenue and profit.

General Motors already set a high bar when it reported its quarterly earnings last week, which included larger-than-expected profits and an operating margin in North America of nearly 12 percent. Ford will be up first on Tuesday.A half dozen of Europe\u2019s biggest lenders are reporting their third-quarter results this week, including the British lenders Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group; the Spanish bank Santander; the German lender Deutsche Bank; and the French bank BNP Paribas.Several investment banks, including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have reported disappointing results in the third quarter as uncertainty in the financial markets weighed on their results, particularly in bond and fixed-income trading.The brewing giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller have until Wednesday under British takeover rules to complete their discussions on a potential merger. The world\u2019s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, struck an agreement in principle this month to acquire its closest rival, SABMiller, for about $104 billion and agreed to extend a deadline to complete a deal until this week. If the brewers aren\u2019t able to do so by Tuesday, it is possible that SABMiller will seek permission from British regulators to extend the deadline again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Valeant Stock Plunge Shows the Risk of Following the Leader", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorValeant became a darling of hedge funds in 2010, when it acquired Biovail and reincorporated in Canada from the United States to reduce its tax rate. Since then, Valeant has been a merger and acquisition machine, making more than $30 billion in acquisitions, including the $11 billion deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals in March.The acquisitions fed a surge in the company\u2019s growth, which, until recent weeks, had pumped up its stock price. At its peak this year, the stock had risen more than 800 percent since 2010.With the gains, Wall Street predictably hailed Valeant executives as visionaries.Mr. Pearson and his company were certainly riding high until questions emerged about its big price increases and its relationships with specialty pharmacies. This month, the company said it had received subpoenas from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Boston seeking information about its financial assistance programs for patients, its pricing decisions and the distribution of its productsValeant\u2019s story \u2014 as Wall Street likes to say \u2014 suddenly changed. Then came a report that sent Valeant\u2019s shares plunging last week.After the publication\u2019s release, Valeant shares declined almost 40 percent as market fears about the company\u2019s entire strategy came home to roost. The discussion soon turned not just to Citron\u2019s report but also to whether Valeant\u2019s deal-making approach was hiding huge accounting deficiencies, or to be less polite, fraud. Valeant vigorously rejected the report\u2019s claims. (On Monday, the company further defended its practices, but it said its board would form a special committee to examine its relationship with a specialty pharmacy.)Still, the stock decline hit the hedge funds, which had enthusiastically joined the Wall Street party. The hedge funds that own Valeant shares are a who\u2019s who of the industry, including William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns 5.68 percent; John Paulson\u2019s fund, which owns 2.63 percent; and Viking Global, with 1.35 percent. Herd investing is common in hedge funds. Goldman Sachs has even created an index of the 50 stocks most widely held by hedge funds, known as the hedge fund V.I.P. list. It is a list of the favorite hedge funds hotels \u2014 that is, the hot and trendy stocks for hedge funds to pile into.The top stock is Allergan, with 15 percent of its shares held by hedge funds. There are 67 hedge funds that count Allergan stock as one of their top 10 holdings. Second on the list is Apple, and third is Facebook. Amazon and Google are also in the top 10. Valeant is 10th, and 22 percent of Valeant\u2019s shares are held by hedge funds, according to Goldman Sachs.Looking at the list, one has to shake one\u2019s head. After all, I, too, can do this trick of investing in big and well-known tech and pharmaceutical companies, for much less than the fee of 20 percent of the profits that hedge funds charge.It has to make one wonder what one is getting when investing in a hedge fund. How much of a fund\u2019s performance is centered on following the herd? We\u2019ve seen this in shareholder activism, but at least the funds can work together in that situation (or gang up, depending on your perspective). But in so-called long-short investing of this type, following the herd doesn\u2019t make as much sense.One of the other things that the Goldman report notes is that most hedge funds are concentrated, owning only about 10 to 20 stocks. Some hedge fund returns thus appear to come from investing in stocks like Valeant and being highly concentrated in those stocks. Yet the risk of such concentration may not be worth it.The herd doesn\u2019t include all funds. ValueAct is anything but a short-term investor, having held Valeant stock for years, and Pershing Square actually bought more shares last week.Still, the reversal in Valeant\u2019s shares ought to spur more scrutiny of these hedge fund investment strategies.In recent years, it has been a winning strategy for hedge funds to pick a handful or so of companies in pharmaceuticals and technology.Just as Valeant was declining, another hedge fund favorite \u2014 Microsoft, No. 15 on Goldman\u2019s list \u2014 was popping, in part again a result of ValueAct shaking up management and pressuring Steven A. Ballmer out the door.So are many hedge funds simply playing follow the leader?There are thousands of stocks, but hedge funds seem to be concentrating their bets in the larger caps and certain industries. The Goldman index shows that almost 62 percent of hedge fund investments are of companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. One has to wonder how much research and monitoring is actually being done by hedge funds. The strategy seems to work to some extent \u2014 Goldman reports that the V.I.P. list of the most invested-in stocks has repeatedly outpaced the S.&P. But is this again simply because the funds are chasing flavor-of-the-month stocks?As Goldman acknowledges, this strategy may work in a rising market, but in a down market, the decline would be painful.If hedge funds are all about alpha \u2014 that is, finding investments that are undervalued and that can outperform the broader market \u2014 then one would think they would actually migrate to smaller stocks. These are the least followed stocks and the places where research can bear the most fruit.What we have instead is something other than intelligent investing, the fundamental idea behind a hedge fund. It all makes one think that perhaps these investors should really be called \u201cherd funds\u201d instead of \u201chedge funds.\u201dIt certainly seems more apt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ease of Index Funds Comes With Risk ", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe logic of investing in index funds has so far seemed simple and compelling for growing numbers of people.Why spend the time researching individual securities and run the risk of choosing the wrong stock in the wrong sector when you can simply buy the market as a whole? Put your money in an exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., or in a traditional mutual fund that passively tracks a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 or the Russell 2000 and you have instant diversification without the risk of error in security analysis. The fees for such funds are typically very low, too. And E.T.F.s are traded all day, making for easy entry and exit.But if you look closely at such funds, as several scholars and analysts have done, you may find that their simplicity harbors some simmering problems, which have grown more troubling in the course of the bull market in stocks.Stocks in the Russell 2000 seem especially bloated in valuation when compared with non-index peers. S&P Capital IQ compared the valuation of stocks within that index to stocks of similar market capitalization that are not in the index. It used a common valuation metric, the ratio of stock price-to-book value. It found that the valuation gap between stocks in the index, and those outside it, had swollen enormously. That could make investing in the index a riskier proposition than is widely understood.Nonetheless, the popularity of index-tracking funds is unquestionable. They now account for over 30 percent of all stock and bond mutual fund and exchange-traded fund assets under management, according to Morningstar.But cracks in the edifice of passive investing are beginning to show. While investing in index funds may still make a good deal of sense, it\u2019s important to understand some of the funds\u2019 pitfalls.The August downturn, for example, featured multiple E.T.F. trading halts that suggested the funds are not easy to get out of in periods of high volatility. For the month as a whole, index stocks, especially those in the Russell 2000, also sold off a bit more sharply than non-index stocks, notes James Xiong, head of quantitative research at Morningstar. And both during and before the correction, index stocks moved together with a high enough correlation to call diversification claims into question.Most disturbing, though, is the increasingly distorted levels of the valuations of some of the largest index funds. The combination of a long-toothed bull market and the significant shift to passive investing has indiscriminately buoyed all stocks in major indexes like the S.&P. 500 and the Russell 2000. Stocks that might not be bought singly on their own merits have been lifted by the package buying. Some portfolio managers, academics and market trackers now contend that the soaring of the mediocre alongside the exceptional has produced unusually elevated valuations.The existence of a valuation premium for stocks newly included in index funds has long been known, of course. On average, from 1990 to 2005, when a stock was added to the S.&P. 500 \u2014 effectively requiring many investors to hold the stock for the first time \u2014 the mere inclusion added almost 9 percent to share prices, according to Jeffrey Wurgler, a professor of finance at New York University.And it\u2019s possible that, to some degree at least, stocks that are included in index funds are chosen precisely because their prospects are better and they deserve a higher valuation. In addition, another factor behind the current high valuations of stocks in the indexes is that investors have generally favored large-cap stocks in the current bull market, and the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000 track such stocks.Even so, current valuations for stocks in the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000 have soared well beyond what might otherwise be expected, some analysts and portfolio managers say.According to the calculations of S&P Capital IQ, non-Russell 2000 index stocks carry a median price-to-book value ratio of 1.34. But index stocks are accorded a 61.9 percent valuation premium at 2.16 price-to-book as of June 30. The premium has been in place each of the last 10 years but has been rising. In 2006, for example, it was just 12 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that passive investing in E.T.F.s and index funds inflates the price of index stocks versus non-index stocks,\u201d said Brian Frank, who manages the Frank Value mutual fund. \u201cThe whole market is overvalued,\u201d he added. \u201cIndex stocks are more overvalued.\u201dRandall Morck, a business professor at the University of Alberta, has also concluded that stocks with the good fortune to be included in a major index receive premium valuation over those that are left out. Professor Morck is gathering data on current index valuations. He has tracked stock valuations through 2009. \u201cIt appears that the index premium rises as the market becomes more overvalued,\u201d he said.Professor Wurgler has also researched index premiums. \u201cThe evidence says that stock prices increasingly depend not just on fundamentals but also on the happenstance of index membership,\u201d he said.Passive investment vehicles, promoted for diversification benefits, also fall short of such claims. During the August downturn, the correlation in index stock movement spiked and was \u201cvery high\u201d according to David Pope, managing director of quantitative research at S&P Capital IQ. Mr. Xiong of Morningstar says that index stocks \u2014 even apart from the correction \u2014 tend to move together. \u201cWe clearly see trading commonality,\u201d Mr. Xiong said. With higher correlation, \u201cdiversification benefits decline,\u201d he added.The rise of passive investing in the current bull market has most distorted the valuation of small- and midcap stocks, some experts maintain. Frank Gannon, co-chief investment officer at Royce & Associates, says that every market cycle is dominated by specific and historically differentiated factors.The two most significant factors in the current market cycle, he says, have been the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing and the growth of passive investing. These have worked together to benefit weaker companies that are often laden with debt and bereft of earnings. Currently, roughly one-third of all the companies in the Russell 2000, are not earning any money, the highest percentage of non-earners in the history of the index, according to Mr. Gannon. So on one hand, quantitative easing has helped the weakest companies refinance debt at lower rates. On the other, passive investing has lifted the share prices of the weak along with the strong. \u201cThe growth of passive investing in the small-cap space has supported the non-earners in indexes like the Russell 2000,\u201d Mr. Gannon said.Asked to illustrate overvaluation with specific pairs of index and non-index stocks, Mr. Frank, the portfolio manger, cited Sovran Self Storage and Public Storage. Both are in the self-storage business, which has been flourishing. Public Storage, which is in the S.&P. 500, trades at a multiple of 36.9 times trailing 12-month earnings. Sovran, not in the index, trades at 31.7 times trailing earnings.Premium index valuation is also illustrated by comparison of the freight haulers J.B. Hunt Transport Services and Swift Transportation, according to Mr. Frank. J.B. Hunt, which is in the S.&P. 500, trades at 20.6 times trailing 12-month earnings. Swift carries a multiple of just under 11. Price-to-book value for J.B. Hunt is at a ratio of 6.2 to 1. For Swift, it is just under 3.8 to 1.David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones, said that index inclusion \u201craises the profile\u201d of a company, which tends to increase valuations in several ways. Stock mutual funds and E.T.F.s held by long-term investors own about 12 percent of the shares of each stock in the S.&P. 500, he said. Inclusion therefore reduces the supply of available shares, putting upward pressure on price, he added. Another factor, he said, is that \u201can index is a good place to look for takeover candidates\u201d for mergers and acquisitions, noting that \u201cabout 10 to 15 stocks within the S.&P. 500 are taken over each year.\u201dInvestors who want to avoid exclusive exposure to the premium value stocks of the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000 do have other choices. Vanguard, for example, offers the Total Stock Market E.T.F. which tracks a broader stock market universe \u2014 a total of 4,000 large-cap, midcap and microcap stocks in the CRSP US Total Market index. The Vanguard Total Stock Market mutual fund also tracks that index, which represents nearly all United States stocks and diversifies market exposure. Vanguard spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment. Nobody can say for sure whether the premium valuation of stocks in the S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000 indexes will end with a bang or a whimper. Professor Wurgel notes that in the October 1987 market crash, stocks that were members of the big indexes dropped 7 percent more than non-index stocks. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if we see more of this sort of thing,\u201d he added.Of course, investors concerned about premium valuation and high correlation among S.&P. 500 and Russell 2000 stocks can opt for broader index-based funds, while investors of a more active bent may want to seek out non-index stocks that suffer in valuation comparisons with index peers.So where is this all headed? We don\u2019t really know.Two academic researchers who collaborated on a study that found evidence of premium valuation for index stocks foresee differing consequences.\u201cI think index stocks would be hurt more in a deeper downturn,\u201d said David Nanigian, associate professor of investments at the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa.But Michael Finke, a co-author of the study and a professor of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University, sees things playing out less dramatically.More likely than a sharp sell-off in index stocks is the continuing popularity and even greater overvaluation of the group, he said. In time, Professor Finke suggests, index stocks will become ever more overvalued and that fact will finally be broadly recognized. The eventual result? \u201cThey will underperform,\u201d he predicted, suggesting a shift by investors to non-index stocks.Wise investors may still opt to choose index-based funds, but they should at least be aware of premium and diversification issues. And they should be careful about which indexes their funds are tracking.Advertisement"}
