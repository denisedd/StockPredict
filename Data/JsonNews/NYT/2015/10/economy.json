{"Headline": "\u2018The Conquering Tide,\u2019 by Ian W. Toll", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.World War II in the Pacific embraced half the globe across a watery expanse dotted with jungle-clad islands and barren coral atolls. In the decades before Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States war-gamed responses to Japanese aggression in a series of \u201cOrange\u201d plans. These envisioned a rapid counterattack westward across the central Pacific via some combination of the Gilbert, Marshall, Caroline and Mariana Islands to the Philippines.After Dec. 7, 1941, the magnitude of this undertaking became even more evident when Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who had assumed command of Allied forces in Australia after escaping from the Philippines, proposed an alternate strategy. \u00adMacArthur passionately argued for a return to the Philippines through the southwest Pacific, but the United States Navy stubbornly clung to a line of advance across the central Pacific.Ian W. Toll, no stranger to students of naval history who are familiar with his acclaimed \u201cSix Frigates: The Epic History of the Founding of the U.S. Navy,\u201d has already chronicled the sea battles of the first six months of the war in \u201cPacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942.\u201d \u201cThe Conquering Tide\u201d picks up where \u201cPacific Crucible\u201d left off and provides a gripping narrative of the central Pacific campaign.Japanese expansion had been blunted at the battle of the Coral Sea and dealt a major defeat at Midway, but a long Japanese finger of expansion thrusting through the Solomon Islands still threatened the Allied lifeline from America\u2019s West Coast and Hawaii to Australia. Adm. Ernest J. King, commander in chief of the United States fleet, was determined not only to safeguard this route at all costs, but also to launch a counteroffensive that he hoped would suck in Japanese \u00adresources and divert the enemy\u2019s attention from other areas of the Pacific.Relying on official correspondence and histories as well as personal reminiscences, Toll reveals his approach early on. While rightly presenting King as a global strategist, he also portrays the rank and file who bore the brunt of implementing that strategy. These include an Australian coast watcher radioing reports from his tenuous perch on Bougainville Island and a young American carrier pilot flying his F4F Wildcat into a swarm of Japanese Zeros.The fighting for Guadalcanal racked up horrendous losses on both sides in men, planes and ships. Shortly after the First Marine Division landed in early August 1942 to retake the island, the Navy suffered one of its worst defeats in an engagement with Japanese cruisers off Savo Island. King took the news in stride and refused to retreat. On the Japanese side, Vice Adm. Gunichi Mikawa was criticized for failing to press the attack against the American transports anchored offshore.Several long months later, Guadalcanal was firmly in American hands and King\u2019s strategy of an early counteroffensive to absorb Japanese resources had been vindicated. \u201cBy consuming so many scarce cargo ships,\u201d Toll writes, \u201cthe fight for Guadalcanal threatened to cripple the entire Japanese war economy, which could not function without raw materials imported into the home islands.\u201dToll is strong on the operational details of battle, but he is no less skilled at presenting something that is frequently missing from military histories, a well-\u00adrounded depiction of the home front on both sides. Strategic planning conferences in Washington sought to balance military necessities with political realities; the Japanese high command in Tokyo faced similar issues but were far less candid with the Japanese public. Well into 1944, most Japanese civilians knew little of the war\u2019s progress except from government news stories that reported all actions as glorious victories.Occasionally, the reader senses a disruption in the narrative or a turn down a dead end. A case in point is a chapter combining descriptions of a \u201cjaded and unfriendly\u201d San Francisco \u201coverrun with servicemen\u201d with tales from the war patrols of the submarine Wahoo. But Toll\u2019s descriptions of down-the-throat torpedo attacks against Japanese destroyers are so tense that here, as elsewhere, he successfully entwines a digressive thread with his main story to pull one onward.Nothing underscored America\u2019s enormous industrial output better than the numbers of Essex-class fast carriers arriving in the Pacific throughout 1943. \u201cLess than a year earlier,\u201d Toll writes, \u201cthe Saratoga and Enterprise had been the sole remaining American carriers left in the Pacific. To lay eyes on 13 friendly flattops between sunrise and sunset,\u201d he says, quoting Roger Bond, a quartermaster on the Saratoga, \u201cmade it \u2018an awesome, awesome day.\u2019\u200a\u201dOnce Guadalcanal was secure, this increased amphibious power was turned against the Gilbert Islands and what many thought would be an easy fight for the flat coral speck of Tarawa. It proved anything but, and hard lessons were learned from wildly fluctuating tides, ineffective naval bombardments and poor coordination with air support. Sharon Tosi Lacey chronicled the evolution of these amphibious operations in detail in \u201cPacific Blitzkrieg: World War II in the Central Pacific,\u201d but Toll remains focused on the big picture. \u201cIn less than three months\u2019 time,\u201d he says, \u201cthe costly lessons of Tarawa had been refined and integrated into amphibious planning and doctrine.\u201dAbsorbing the lessons of Tarawa, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, boldly told his subordinates he would strike next at the heart of the Marshall Islands and take the principal island of Kwajalein in one bite rather than nibble away at the encircling atolls. The result was that in less than three months\u2019 time, the operations against the Gilbert and Marshall Islands \u201chad kicked down Japan\u2019s mid-Pacific barricade.\u201dFor the United States Navy, the next step was obvious. While there was a continuing debate between the central Pacific line of advance and MacArthur\u2019s route through the Philippines, King remained convinced that the central Pacific islands of Guam, Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas held the key to victory. They were so situated that the sea lanes linking Japan to its supply of natural resources in the East Indies could be interdicted and bases could be established for the new B-29 bombers to strike the Japanese home islands.To defend the Marianas, Japanese leaders realized they needed to force the major confrontation that both sides had long contemplated. This was the Battle of the Philippine Sea, whose first day, a frenzy of aerial combat, was known on the American side as the Marianas Turkey Shoot. The account of that day and the next afternoon\u2019s strike against retreating Japanese carriers is grippingly told, although Toll discounts as apocryphal Adm. Marc Mitscher\u2019s oft-quoted command to \u201cturn on the lights\u201d to aid nighttime carrier landings.Toll rightly acknowledges that the Marianas campaign, coming within days of the invasion of Europe at Normandy, was a stunning achievement. \u201cThat two such colossal assaults could be launched against fortified enemy shores, in the same month and at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass,\u201d he writes, \u201cwas a supreme demonstration of American military-industrial hegemony.\u201dAfter the conquest of the Marianas, there would be another year of tough fighting in both the southwest Pacific at Leyte and Luzon and the central Pacific on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Much of that story is to come in the third volume of his planned Pacific War trilogy, but Toll convincingly argues that the success in the Marianas was pivotal. \u201cThough Americans were slow to appreciate it,\u201d he concludes, \u201cthey had just won the decisive victory of the Pacific War.\u201dTHE CONQUERING TIDEWar in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944By Ian W.

{"Headline": "Italy Sends Eritreans to Sweden as E.U. Migrant Relocations Begin", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 19 young Eritreans dutifully smiled for official photographs with European and Italian officials on the tarmac at Ciampino Airport outside Rome, then boarded a government plane bound for Lulea, on the Gulf of Bothnia about 1,680 miles to the north, where the Swedish authorities awaited them.\u201cThat plane is a symbol of victory,\u201d for a vision of Europe \u201cable to be supportive and responsible, a Europe that can save human lives,\u201d Angelino Alfano, the Italian interior minister, told reporters at a news conference shortly after the plane took off.The relocation program is meant to move 160,000 asylum seekers now sheltering in Greece and Italy to other European countries over the next two years. It was adopted last month after drawn-out and combative negotiations among the union\u2019s 28 members, with some Eastern European countries resisting the most.More than 580,000 migrants and refugees have reached the European Union by sea so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. The influx of people fleeing poverty and strife has swamped the ability of the countries where they land to accommodate them, raised social tensions and widened political divisions within Europe over what to do.\u201cToday is a defeat for those who are against Europe, and think it is better for the Mediterranean to become a lake of death,\u201d Mr. Alfano said, a jab at politicians in Italy and elsewhere who play to anti-immigrant sentiment.Jean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg, said the start of the resettlement project showed that Europe \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean only budgetary crises, financial problems, migration crisis.\u201d Mr. Asselborn said it also showed that \u201cwe have the power, energy and will to solve these problems.\u201d Luxembourg currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union.For humanitarian agencies that have been pushing for a safe and legal alternative to migrant smuggling, the flight on Friday was \u201can important step in the protection of asylum seekers,\u201d said Federico Soda, an I.O.M. official based in Rome.Under the current rules, only Syrians, Eritreans and Iraqis qualify for resettlement under the program.Waiting to fly to Sweden on Friday morning, a 26-year-old Eritrean who gave his name as Michele said he was looking forward to going to a democratic country like Sweden. \u201cI want to live serenely,\u201d he said.To qualify, Michele had to request asylum and be fingerprinted in Italy. Many migrants are loath to do that because of European regulations that ordinarily restrict asylum seekers to the first member country where they register; most of them want to move north from Italy or Greece to countries with stronger economies.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.Like the other passengers, Michele was traveling light. Most had a small carry-on bag packed with donated clothes and a few personal belongings that survived the long trip across the Sahara and the Mediterranean. \u201cThey arrive with nothing,\u201d said Nardos Neamin, a cultural mediator at an Italian Red Cross tent camp where six of the Eritreans on the plane had been living.Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for migration, told reporters in Rome on Friday that the flight to Sweden was \u201ca journey of hope,\u201d part of a program that also includes repatriating people who have no legal claim to asylum. \u201cIt is a tangible example of what we can do if we work together in the spirit of solidarity,\u201d he said.Asylum seekers will be provided with \u201cshelter, legal status and a welcoming atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Avramopoulos said, but will not have a say in where they are sent. \u201cI know that many want to go to specific countries,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be done.\u201dMr. Alfano, the Italian interior minister, said that 100 more people would be sent to Germany, the Netherlands or other countries in the next few weeks, and that all told, Italy would relocate about 40,000 within two years.According to Mr. Soda of the I.O.M., Europe needs to convince the refugees that the relocation program is preferable to a people-smuggling system that puts them at risk. The challenge, he said, is to reach migrants \u201cbefore they fall into the hands of human traffickers and risk their lives.\u201dMs. Neamin said many Eritreans at the Italian Red Cross camp had put off applying for asylum to see how the first group in the program fared. \u201cI am certain, now, that they will register,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Benghazi. What About Libya?", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Inside the Beltway, Libya is the name of a scandal, not a country. But right now, Libya the country has a chance to right its course in its difficult transition to democracy. United Nations talks among the warring factions have come close to yielding a new unified government. For this achievement to produce meaningful results, Libya will need help from the international community, including the United States. But is anyone in Washington paying attention?There is the House Select Committee on Benghazi, of course. But Thursday\u2019s spectacle, in which former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testified, focused on events that occurred three years ago. None of our leaders in Congress or in the administration seem to acknowledge the need to help Libya right now. And as the leading Democratic presidential candidate, Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t providing much guidance either, despite her commitment in the past. Instead she\u2019s fending off partisan attacks from her Republican antagonists.Libya is of crucial strategic importance to the United States. Geographically, it is a gateway to and from Africa. The Islamic State is beginning to establish a foothold there, and if it gets hold of the country\u2019s enormous oil wealth, the results will be disastrous. Libya can either be a helpful, stable ally to the United States or a failed state, awash with displaced persons and a base of operations for terrorists.The last time I met with Chris was in the embassy in Tripoli in July 2012, just a couple of months before he was killed. He spoke about how fragile the transition was in Libya and how much he worried about the growing unrest in Benghazi. He knew the risks involved in traveling there, but went because he felt he needed to remain engaged.The loss of Chris Stevens was a double blow to United States policy. First, he was the most knowledgeable United States official on what was happening. Second, in the aftermath of the attack that took his life, Libya became radioactive in Washington circles. Nobody wanted to touch it. When I visited the embassy in Tripoli shortly after Chris\u2019s death, the embassy staff had shrunk to single digits, guarded by 150 Marines. It was a fortress, not a facility for engagement.United States policy never recovered. Though Mrs. Clinton must continue to defend herself against the select committee\u2019s charges, she could and should pivot to a discussion of policies on Libya that will better protect American interests in the future.Mrs. Clinton has much to be proud of. As she pointed out in the CNN debate, she was one of the chief architects of the NATO intervention that saved tens of thousands of lives and freed Libya from the grips of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s brutal 42-year dictatorship. That would have been a signature foreign policy achievement for Mrs. Clinton and President Obama had the United States not disengaged in Libya. Mr. Obama conceded this in his recent speech to the United Nations: \u201cEven as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind.\u201dThe United States can also strengthen the capacity of the government by providing training programs and advisers for key ministries, especially those that need to rebuild the economy and restore legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Along with NATO, the United States should help train and equip Libyan security forces to keep the peace and stave off the growing presence of the Islamic State. A failure by the United States to lead now could mean that Libya moves closer to a failed state and becomes the home that the Islamic State is looking for in Africa.Do not expect the investigations and recriminations over what happened in Benghazi to end soon. But isn\u2019t it fair to ask our politicians, so driven to find the truth about Benghazi, to dedicate some of their attention to developing a strategy for the United States to help Libya get back on course?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bankers Grapple With How to Help Emerging Markets", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 After a week of discussions here, bankers and policy makers agreed that stemming the rush of investments from emerging markets was one of the most important challenges facing the global economy. But there was little agreement on how to actually do that.On official panels, in closed-room sessions and over drinks in Lima restaurants, market participants struggled to come to grips with the persistent flows of money escaping emerging-market stocks and bonds in search of safer investment shores.\u201cWe have never seen something like this,\u201d said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks. Mr. Tran said that he was expecting net outflows from emerging markets to be around $800 billion for this year and next \u2014 by far the largest amount since institutions began investing in these markets in the late 1980s.The fear is that these numbers could increase substantially, especially if China\u2019s currency weakens further. That could result in a rolling series of emerging-market crises.And Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, said at a panel discussion on Saturday that if you had just awakened from a yearslong slumber and had to make a decision about raising rates, you would most likely choose not to do so.\u201cWe have a global economic growth problem,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.But those on the front lines of the outflows of funds from the emerging markets \u2014 central bankers in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia and Mexico \u2014 are beginning to say that the Fed\u2019s decision to hold back has actually made their job more difficult. That is because instead of staying put, or making new investments, investors are rushing out all the faster, spooked that the Fed has larger fears about China and other emerging markets.\u201cI heard time and again this week from governors of emerging-market central banks that it\u2019s not the hike itself that worries them,\u201d said Jacob A. Frenkel, the chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase International and the former head of Israel\u2019s central bank. \u201cIt\u2019s how much and when it occurs.\u201dSome experts argued that money would continue to flow out of China, the emerging market that most worries investors, regardless of whether the Fed raised rates.For years, Chinese savers were happy to keep their wealth in the renminbi because they knew it would keep its value, said David Lubin, head of emerging-market economics at Citigroup. Now, with the renminbi expected to devalue more, \u201cthey are looking to shift into dollars,\u201d Mr. Lubin said.This trend will continue regardless of what the Fed does, he said.The mantra, from the I.M.F. on down, has been that emerging-market governments need to regain the confidence of investors by keeping budget deficits under control and not letting their currency declines run out of control.\u201cEmerging-market countries have to put their own house in order,\u201d said Ariosto Revoredo de Carvalho, a senior executive at Brazil\u2019s central bank. \u201cThere is no cavalry here \u2014 no external help coming from China or the Fed. That puts more pressure on governments to do their own work.\u201dAnd while there have been a few calls from economists for countries most vulnerable to outflows to impose capital controls to make taking money out of these economies more difficult, most central bankers at the Lima meetings rejected such an option.\u201cThe first thing an investor asks when he comes in is where is the exit,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank, who was speaking on a panel about monetary policies in Latin America. \u201cIf he does not know where it is, he won\u2019t come in.\u201dAs an open economy, Mr. Carstens said, Mexico depends too much on these investors for its financing needs to scare them away with such policies.Over the last week, emerging-market currencies and stock markets have experienced a bounce of sorts \u2014 halting what had been a deep slide.But analysts are not convinced that financial stability can return to these markets without a greater sense of certainty about what the Fed plans to do.\u201cDelaying an increase in rates only increases volatility and uncertainty in emerging markets,\u201d said David Fernandez, a currency and bond specialist at Barclays in Singapore. \u201cEmerging markets will continue to see outflows.\u201dThe I.M.F.\u2019s public stance in support of the Fed has provoked some criticism here \u2014 especially because the fund, more than any other institution, is aware of how dangerous the combination of uncertainty and volatile capital flows can be for emerging-market economies.\u201cWhen I travel around the world, I find hardly anyone supporting the Fed\u2019s policy on interest rates,\u201d said a senior European official, who did not want to be publicly identified criticizing the I.M.F. \u201cThe fund has become very short-term-oriented.\u201dSome also saw the fund\u2019s support of the Fed as going beyond its mandate, which is to keep an eye on the financial health of its member countries.The fund has heard the criticisms.David Lipton, the No. 2 executive at the I.M.F., said the fund was aware that this liquidity had adverse side effects. But, he argued, if lower rates were needed to keep the United States economy healthy, then that should be the course of action.For the time being, emerging markets will keep playing a waiting game.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ratings Winner for CNBC Is Ammunition for G.O.P. ", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere was the good news for CNBC: The Republican debate on Wednesday night delivered the biggest ratings in the financial news network\u2019s history, with 14 million people tuning in, more than Game 2 of the World Series on Fox, which aired at the same time.But in the hours after the debate and all day Thursday, CNBC confronted withering criticism over its handling of the event. The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, and the candidates complained about the focus of the questioning, perceived bias and a lack of speaking time. By the end of the day an event that was supposed to be about candidates\u2019 explaining their economic policies had instead started a Republican assault on the news media.Advisers to several campaigns are planning a private meeting in Washington on Sunday to strategize over how to pressure both the R.N.C. \u2014 which several campaigns blame for bungling the debate process \u2014 and the networks to address their concerns, ranging from format and rules to moderators and airtime. The Republican committee was not invited.\u201cI think maybe it has the possibility of being a very important moment in American politics,\u201d Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is a Republican candidate, said Thursday, \u201cbecause it so clearly demonstrates the need for a change in format.\u201dDuring the debate, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida called the news media \u201cthe ultimate super PAC\u201d for Democrats. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blasted the moderators\u2019 questions, saying that \u201ceveryone home tonight knows that the moderators have no intention of voting in a Republican primary.\u201d The debate was moderated by the CNBC anchors John Harwood, Becky Quick and Carl Quintanilla.\u201cThis is not a cage match,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. Reciting a list of questions he characterized as lacking relevance \u2014 \u201cBen Carson, can you do math?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cruz scolded the moderators, asking \u201cHow about talking about the substantive issues?\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Carson tried to leverage their criticism of the news media into a fund-raising tool, seeking donations to bolster the \u201cwar on the liberal media,\u201d as Mr. Cruz described it in a message to supporters. His campaign said it had raised $1.1 million since the debate.\u201cCNBC is supposed to be a business, jobs and economy network, right?\u201d said Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief and now the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cThe disconnect between the expectation and what you got was remarkable.\u201dHe called CNBC\u2019s handling of the debate questions \u201ca mess.\u201dKathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, specifically pointed to Mr. Harwood\u2019s first question for Donald J. Trump when he asked the candidate if he was running a \u201ccomic book version of a presidential campaign.\u201d (Mr. Harwood is a contributor to The New York Times).History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty strong characterization that borders on ridicule of the candidacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt puts the reporter in the role of a person who appears to have a stake in the outcome. That\u2019s problematic press behavior.\u201dCNBC did not make the moderators available for comment on Thursday, but a spokesman for the cable channel, Brian Steel, said, \u201cPeople who want to be president of the United States should be able to answer tough questions.\u201dAnd even though many of the candidates expressed anger, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio said he was fine with the moderators\u2019 questions, and Mr. Rubio and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, despite their criticism Wednesday night, both appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Thursday morning.But Mr. Priebus said in an interview Thursday that CNBC\u2019s debate was \u201ctotally out of their own normal operating mode if you watch them every morning.\u201d\u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d he said.The tension between the network and the campaigns began earlier Wednesday, at the start of the undercard debate, with Mr. Priebus complaining that a scroll at the bottom of the screen was detracting from the debate.Then, during the prime-time face-off, Danny Diaz, Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign manager, began pounding on the door to the CNBC work space to complain that his candidate was not receiving equal time. (Ultimately, Mr. Bush received under seven minutes of airtime. )On Thursday Mr. Spicer and Katie Walsh, the national committee\u2019s chief of staff, continued discussing with the campaigns potential changes.The ratings do tell a better story for CNBC, even if Wednesday\u2019s program was the lowest-rated debate this year. The previous two Republican debates, on Fox News in August and on CNN last month, each attracted more than 23 million viewers, and CNN\u2019s Democratic debate on Oct. 13 brought in 15.8 million viewers.This is the third election cycle that CNBC had a Republican debate, and Mark Hoffman, CNBC\u2019s chairman, said beforehand that it was a good investment for the network, which asked advertisers for as much as $250,000 for a 30-second spot.\u201cThese elections turn on how people feel about their world and their life and their personal economy and their money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt it made sense for us to be there and I think it\u2019s really been worthwhile.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Gathering Clouds of Discontent", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHamburg, Germany \u2014 IT\u2019S getting darker and colder here in Germany, and it\u2019s not just because winter is coming.The collective summertime optimism generated by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door policy for refugees has soured. Ominous street protests, outfitted with mock guillotines, are now almost daily occurrences. In Dresden, during a gathering of several thousand citizens who purport to defend Western civilization against the influx of barbaric Muslims, a man held up a homemade gallows with a dangling sign reading, \u201cReserved for Angela Merkel.\u201dAnd they\u2019re angry about more than just refugees. Around the same time, in Berlin, protesters rallying against the proposed trans-Atlantic free trade agreement carried a guillotine. Its bloodstained blade carried a warning to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel of the Social Democrats: \u201cWatch out, Sigmar!\u201dOf course, every cause can attract idiots of one kind or another. What\u2019s worrying is that these fantasies of violence are the extreme expression of a sentiment that, in milder gradations, is taking hold of ever-larger parts of German society.While only a minority of the protesters would be likely to agree that Ms. Merkel and Mr. Gabriel are traitors and need to be punished accordingly, most would probably agree with the larger point, that Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has gone too far on the things that, until now, were modern Germany\u2019s leading attributes: free trade and open borders.What we see on the rise, in other words, is not the anger of a classic loony fringe, but rather mainstream people striking out at elites who they believe have lost touch with reality and common sense. To many here, the refugee crisis, the euro crisis, the Ukraine crisis and the threats seen in an unleashed global capitalism have converged in a fundamental question: Do the mighty still know what they are doing?This is a question that touches upon the core connection between people and government. And it is why Ms. Merkel has more to lose than a couple of popularity points in opinion polls. Once citizens get the impression that those in charge are losing control, the general acceptance of democratic representatives will give way to loathing.Indeed, it would be generous to say that Ms. Merkel knows what she is doing. On the big questions of our time, she is merely hedging her bets and hoping for a good outcome.In the euro crisis, she has put a wager of 72 billion euros of German taxpayers\u2019 money on the bet that the Greek state and economy will recover. In the Ukraine crisis, she has placed the livelihood of many German export companies on the bet that Russia will back down in the face of European sanctions.And now, as up to 10,000 refugees enter Germany every day, she has placed a third bet. \u201cWe will manage this\u201d was the chancellor\u2019s central message when asked why she temporarily suspended immigration controls.This last bet is the riskiest of all. First, it is not only about money, it\u2019s about identity. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to manage this at all!\u201d replied a leading politician of the anti-establishment party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland to Ms. Merkel. Before 8,000 cheering followers, he invoked the dangers of ethnic dissolution and loss of the \u201cHeimat,\u201d or homeland. In response, the crowd chanted \u201cWe are the people,\u201d emphasis on the \u201cwe.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s second refugee risk: Her \u201cwe can manage this\u201d promise is up against the clock and the approaching winter. As the public services struggle with the refugees already here, it is unclear if they can find decent accommodation should the rush continue. That raises the prospect of a winter of discontent, with angry Germans facing off against irate immigrants.The third risk is that Ms. Merkel may have a better sense for global than for local challenges, hearing but not understanding the strain placed on municipalities by the influx. In a recent Facebook post, Boris Palmer, the mayor of the prosperous university town of T\u00fcbingen, warned: \u201cWe can\u2019t manage this.\u201dAs a prominent member of the liberal Green Party, Mr. Palmer is the last person to stir up xenophobia. Yet even he has warned that the refugee crisis means that \u201cthe social peace in this country is at stake.\u201dThe roulette wheel of Ms. Merkel\u2019s refugee gamble is still turning, but it has already changed Germany\u2019s political landscape. The frustration felt among Germany\u2019s traditional center-left and center-right voters has dislodged them from their traditional parties. To them, the fringe parties \u2014 Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland on the right, Die Linke on the left \u2014 offer quick and easy certainties: no to refugees, no to free trade.Both populist parties will get their big chance next year, when Germany holds elections in three federal states. Sadly, it is likely that in their rage to punish the establishment, many Germans will fall for the seduction of the populists, pushing the country into the illiberal, reactionary direction it has so long struggled to avoid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Assassination Attempt in Tunisia Highlights Mounting Challenges", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe assailants missed their target. But the attack, on Thursday, was an urgent reminder of the violence that still menaces Tunisia\u2019s transition, one of many challenges to the country\u2019s significant and celebrated political gains.The challenges are testing not only the young government but also the compromise between secular and Islamist parties that is at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s inchoate political system and is frequently held up as a model for the Arab world.Talk of Tunisia\u2019s success is frequently attributed to its relatively peaceful transition, especially set against the violent struggles of other countries in the region, including Syria, Yemen and neighboring Libya. That contrast often overlooks an arduous road that began in December 2010, when a Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi lit himself on fire, in an act of despair that resonated throughout the Arab world.But a backlash against Ennahda paralleled events in Egypt, where huge demonstrations led to a military coup in 2013 against the year-old government of President Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, now banned.Giant protests that summer threatened to topple the Ennahda-led government. But the Islamists refused to cede power until they completed their mandate to pass a new Constitution.The impasse began to destabilize the country as the government grappled with jihadist militancy, popular unrest and strikes, and a worsening economy.After months of sometimes heated negotiations, a deal, concluded in December 2013, forged a new contract between the political parties, including a timetable for a democratic transition. The Islamist government agreed to step down and hand power to a caretaker government that would oversee the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections in October and November 2014. The adoption of the Constitution, in January 2014, was seen as a high point in the transition, producing a charter forged from robust debates between Tunisia\u2019s disparate political currents, and that enshrined democratic principles and a separation of powers.Compromises by two men \u2014 Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, and Beji Caid Essebsi, one of the founders of the secularist Nidaa Tounes party, and Tunisia\u2019s current president \u2014 ended the impasse, analysts say.Despite that achievement, the basis of their compromise remains fragile: \u201cIt is very much a consensus from the top \u2014 often against elements of their base,\u201d said Issandr El Amrani, who oversees the North Africa Project for the International Crisis Group.As both leaders manage the pressures from within their own ranks, the government has been criticized for lacking a sense of direction and dynamism as well as for failing to tackle urgent issues, Mr. Amrani said. \u201cThis worries people.\u201dThe assassination attempt on Thursday, he said, could have been a sign of this tension, \u201cthe bigger underlying elite rivalries in Tunisia that are working themselves out.\u201dBut the motives for the attacks and other threats against political figures have been murky, given Tunisia\u2019s overlapping rivalries.The Parliament member who survived the assassination attempt on Thursday, Ridha Charfeddine, 63, is a member of Nidaa Tounes and also a prominent businessman who owns a soccer team. The gunmen, riding in the back seat of a white car, attacked him in an industrial section of Sousse, on Tunisia\u2019s eastern coast, according to the Interior Ministry. Sousse is the same beachside town where a 23-year-old Tunisian gunman slaughtered 38 people, mostly British tourists, in June. It was Tunisia\u2019s worst terrorist attack in living memory.\u201cThis is not an isolated incident,\u201d Mohsen Marzouk, the general secretary of Nidaa Tounes, said in an interview with a local radio station after the gunfire. He said the gunmen belonged to an organized movement, but he did not identify it.As the political violence and jihadist attacks have unnerved the public, they have also given rise to fears about the state\u2019s reaction. The police have reasserted themselves in response to the attacks, despite growing reports of human rights abuses and a lack of coherent strategy to reform the security services, Mr. Amrani said. In the aftermath of the attack on the tourists in Sousse, the government also started closing dozens of mosques \u2014 prompting concern that Mr. Essebsi\u2019s secular government, with its strong connections to the old dictatorship, was reviving the crackdowns on Islamists that occurred during Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s rule. The government closed at least 80 mosques, though none of them had any connection to the gunman in Sousse, officials said. Farah Samti reported from Tunis, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.

{"Headline": "What Happened to Working Women?", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJapan now has a higher proportion of working women than we do. I\u2019m trying to get my head around this fact.\u201cEveryone else is continuing to rise and we\u2019ve declined, and now we\u2019re basically tied with Japan. And Japan\u2019s on the upswing and we\u2019re still going down,\u201d said Jason Furman, chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. He was pointing to a chart that shows women in the labor force in 24 countries. These are the usual suspects when we\u2019re comparing ourselves to other societies \u2014 Australia, Belgium, Canada, etc.\u201cWhen it came to women in the workplace, the United States used to be seventh. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re 20th,\u201d said Furman in a phone interview. You\u2019ll be happy to know that while Ireland also seems to be closing in on us, it\u2019ll be a hell of a long time before we fall below Turkey.Stick with me for a minute on this. We spend half of our national debate time talking about how economically fragile Americans feel. Why do you think that is? Well, there\u2019s the whopping disproportion of national wealth flowing into the pockets of the already-wealthy. And the plummeting power of labor unions.But women falling out of the work force is also a huge deal. It reduces family standards of living and puts a crimp in the economy.And why do you think this is happening? One of the reasons is clearly, positively, absolutely the cost of child care.And infant care is impossible. In most states infant care is more expensive than college tuition.We generally \u2014 and rightly \u2014 talk about early childhood education as something that\u2019s critical because it increases kids\u2019 chances of success in school. But as Carmel Martin of the Center for American Progress points out, \u201cthere\u2019s also evidence of a positive effect on the economy over all.\u201dI am going to take a huge leap of faith and say that Japan is not trying to bring its mothers into the work force because of its historic commitment to feminism. (Last year, when a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly made a speech calling for more services for women, she was taunted with cries of \u201cGet married!\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t you even bear a child?\u201d)But the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is convinced that encouraging working women will stimulate the economy. Now Japan, where 64 percent of working-age women are employed, compared to 63 percent in the United States, is in the process of creating 400,000 new prekindergarten spaces.We will now stop for a moment and recall that in 1971, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that would have made quality preschool education available to every family in the United States that wanted it, with tuition based on the family\u2019s ability to pay. Also after-school programs for older children. Forty-four years ago! Richard Nixon vetoed it, muttering something about \u201ccommunal approaches to child rearing.\u201dThere\u2019s also paid family leave. Japan guarantees that mothers get 58 weeks of maternity leave, about half of it paid. In this week\u2019s Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders said he was embarrassed that the United States was the only \u201ccountry on earth\u201d that did not guarantee workers paid maternity leave. This was inaccurate, since Sanders completely overlooked the situation in Papua New Guinea.During the debate Hillary Clinton laced into Carly Fiorina\u2019s argument that government shouldn\u2019t \u201cdictate to the private sector\u201d about family leave. \u201cThey don\u2019t mind having big government to interfere with a woman\u2019s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They\u2019re fine with big government when it comes to that. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Clinton said. It was really one of her better moments.You may be stunned to hear that while the Republicans talk endlessly about ginning up the American economy, the idea of helping working mothers stay in the labor force does not come up all that often. Although Ben Carson has described preschool as \u201cindoctrination.\u201dFrom Richard Nixon to Ben Carson, and wow, nothing\u2019s changed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beirut\u2019s Art Scene Stirs Amid Tumult", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The Aishti Foundation, a splashy new waterfront art space and shopping mall that opened on Sunday, showcases the blue-chip contemporary art collection of a Beirut luxury retail magnate. Massimiliano Gioni, the globe-trotting artistic director at the New Museum in New York, assembled the first exhibition. The prominent architect David Adjaye designed the building.How the city can contain such contradictions is a testament to its vivacity, history of surviving sectarian conflicts and long-established art scene. The cultural developments also result from local wealth and a wealthy diaspora \u2014 call it a remittance economy of the 1 percent \u2014 and a weak central government leaving a gap often filled by individual initiatives.In this chaotic context, Tony Salam\u00e9, the 48-year-old founder of Aishti, Lebanon\u2019s answer to Saks Fifth Avenue, decided to build a mall with a large wing (about 13,100 square feet) to show off the collection of more than 2,000 pieces he and his wife, Elham, have acquired in the past 15 years, including works by Gerhard Richter, Glenn Ligon, Lucio Fontana, Carol Bove, Christopher Wool and many others.Still, he had wanted to move forward. \u201cI think the best thing with a project, you forget about the uncertainty in the place, you keep on going,\u201d he said. The building went up remarkably quickly, at a cost of around $100 million, Mr. Salam\u00e9 said, just three years after Mr. Adjaye, one of the world\u2019s most sought-after architects, first sketched his design and two years after ground was broken.The inaugural show of 100 pieces is called \u201cNew Skin,\u201d after a work by the artist Alice Channer. Mr. Gioni said the concept was \u201cto look at abstraction today and to trace back the idea of information as both a theme and a technique.\u201dThe space will be free to the public in a city with few venues that routinely show international contemporary art. Many people here see Aishti and the other initiatives as a kind of defiance against a troubling political situation, but both tourism and spending on luxury goods has declined dramatically, and it remains to be seen how many people will come.While Aishti is meant to showcase one private collection, other museums seek to reconnect Beirut to its past. They include the Sursock Museum, which first opened in 1961 in a 1912 mansion donated to the city by Nicolas Sursock, who came from a prosperous family and began collecting Lebanese art in the 1920s. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the gulf,\u201d said Zeina Arida, the director of the museum. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting from scratch.\u201dThe museum reopened on Oct. 8 and is a rare example of a privately run museum funded by the city. After years in which most art initiatives here were private, Ms. Arida said, she hoped it would set a new standard. \u201cMaybe the museum is the organization that will enable us to build a model of a public institution that is functional, that is efficient, where you see where the money goes,\u201d she said.The Sursock reopened with a temporary exhibition of images of Beirut from 1800 to 1960, selections from a collection of historical photographic portraits, and a show by contemporary artists that explores Beirut\u2019s changing landscape, a subject that has captivated artists and activists since the city\u2019s war-shattered downtown has been reshaped by new construction.Preserving a slice of the city\u2019s past is the idea behind Beit Beirut, a museum of the city of Beirut, which is taking form in a structure built as a comfortable apartment building in the 1920s but that fell on the Green Line, which divided the largely Muslim west Beirut from the largely Christian east. It was used as a bunker by snipers for the duration of the civil war, from 1975 to 1990.The idea was \u201cto create a museum of memory \u2014 not of the war but of the city,\u201d said Mona Hallak, an architect who helped save the building from demolition in the early 2000s and is involved in the curatorial program, which is still under discussion.Funded by the City of Beirut, the project has been delayed by local politics. It is expected to open next year, said Youssef Haidar, the architect for the renovation, as he toured the dusty site last week, pointing out walls pockmarked by shelling.An article on Monday about the resurgence of art institutions in Beirut, Lebanon, misspelled the given name of the director of the recently reopened Sursock Museum in some editions.

The scientific data he and a team of six other researchers collect here could yield groundbreaking information on the rate at which the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, one of the biggest and fastest-melting chunks of ice on Earth, will drive up sea levels in the coming decades. The full melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet could increase sea levels by about 20 feet.\u201cWe scientists love to sit at our computers and use climate models to make those predictions,\u201d said Laurence C. Smith, head of the geography department at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the leader of the team that worked in Greenland this summer. \u201cBut to really know what\u2019s happening, that kind of understanding can only come about through empirical measurements in the field.\u201dFor years, scientists have studied the impact of the planet\u2019s warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. But while researchers have satellite images to track the icebergs that break off, and have created models to simulate the thawing, they have little on-the-ground information and so have trouble predicting precisely how fast sea levels will rise.Their research could yield valuable information to help scientists figure out how rapidly sea levels will rise in the 21st century, and thus how people in coastal areas from New York to Bangladesh could plan for the change.Each year, the federal government spends about $1 billion to support Arctic and Antarctic research by thousands of scientists like Dr. Smith and his team. The agency officials who receive that money from Congress, including the directors of the National Science Foundation, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, say the research is essential for understanding the changes that will affect the world\u2019s population and economies for more than a century.But the research is under increasing fire by some Republican leaders in Congress, who deny or question the scientific consensus that human activities contribute to climate change.Leading the Republican charge on Capitol Hill is Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House science committee, who has sought to cut $300 million from NASA\u2019s budget for earth science and has started an inquiry into some 50 National Science Foundation grants. On Oct. 13, the committee subpoenaed scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking more than six years of internal deliberations, including \u201call documents and communications\u201d related to the agency\u2019s measurement of climate change.Any cuts could directly affect the work of Dr. Smith and his team, who are supported by a three-year, $778,000 grant from NASA, which must cover everything, including researchers\u2019 salaries, flights, food, computers, scientific instruments and camping, safety and extreme cold-weather gear. Every scientist, Dr. Smith said, is keenly aware that the research costs \u201ca tremendous amount of taxpayer money.\u201dKangerlussuaq, GreenlandIn July, Dr. Smith\u2019s team arrived in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, a dusty outpost of 512 people on the island\u2019s southwest coast, which serves as a base for researchers to prepare for fieldwork on the ice sheet.The scientists were excited but anxious as they prepared to travel inland by helicopter to do the fieldwork at the heart of their research: For 72 hours, every hour on the hour, they would stand watch by a supraglacial watershed, taking measurements \u2014 velocity, volume, temperature and depth \u2014 from the icy bank of the rushing river.\u201cNo one has ever collected a data set like this,\u201d Asa Rennermalm, a professor of geography at the Rutgers University Climate Institute who was running the project with Dr. Smith, told the team over a lunch of musk ox burgers at the Kangerlussuaq airport cafeteria.Taking each measurement was so difficult and dangerous that it would require two scientists at a time, she said. They would have to plan a sleep schedule to ensure that a group was always awake to do the job. Everyone knew the team would be working just upriver from the moulin \u2014 the sinkhole that would sweep anyone who fell into it deep into the ice sheet.The morning before their departure, the team gathered in a hangar to pack gear and provisions: tents, collapsible metal cots, generators, pickaxes, crampons, freeze-dried meals, a wealth of scientific instruments, vials for snow, ice and water samples, and a cooler to bring those samples back to labs in the United States.They also took toilet paper and several plastic bottles, each labeled in marker with a large letter \u201cP.\u201d The bottles were for the scientists to urinate in should they not want to go outside in below-freezing nighttime temperatures to the open-air \u201ctoilet\u201d on the ice. Afterward they would serve a practical purpose, as hot water bottles tucked into sleeping bags.Not least, they packed a pair of 10-pound aerial drones, to map the icy watersheds.Every item was weighed and reweighed since the helicopter could carry no more than 360 kilograms \u2014 794 pounds \u2014 and would have to make several trips. Dr. Smith\u2019s NASA grant covered 10 hours of helicopter flight time, including the pilot\u2019s fee, at a cost of about $5,000 per hour.The scale brought bad news: The gear was far too heavy. \u201cNow we start getting rid of things,\u201d Dr. Smith said grimly as he and the team began jettisoning extra food, utensils and blankets. They scaled down to the barest essentials and anxiously reweighed the items: 359.9 kilograms.At last the helicopter took off with the team\u2019s gear hanging from an attached net sling. The scientists gazed at the seemingly endless surface of the ice, beneath the chopper, spreading in all directions, threaded with aquamarine rivers and lakes. After a 40-minute flight, the pilot cautiously bounced the helicopter on the ice, making sure it was hard enough to land on.Stepping out, the scientists were hit by the cold of the Greenland summer \u2014 the temperature ranged from 26 to 40 degrees while they were there \u2014 a constant wind and the glare of the sun.As the researchers began to set up camp, Mr. Overstreet, the University of Wyoming doctoral student, headed toward the river, silent as it sliced through the ice. More than any other member of the team, the success of the mission rested on his shoulders.Mr. Overstreet, 31, who grew up kayaking and rafting in Oregon, had designed the complex rope-and-pulley system \u2014 modeled on swift-water boat rescue systems \u2014 that would be crucial to gleaning data from the treacherous waters. Before coming to Greenland, he spent months refining and practicing his rope system on rivers in Wyoming.The researchers\u2019 camp.The team soon got to work. A helicopter pilot flew two of Mr. Overstreet\u2019s colleagues, Mr. Pitcher and Matthew Cooper, both of the University of California, Los Angeles, across the 60-foot river. On the opposite bank they drilled into the ice, attached an anchor and harnessed themselves to it for safety. They attached a nylon line to the anchor, with the rest of the line coiled in a heavy bag.Now came the crucial part: The men took turns hurling the bag across the river, but it repeatedly fell into the water. After an anxious half-hour, Mr. Cooper finally got the rope across. Mr. Overstreet caught it and began setting up the rope-and-pulley system he had been testing for so long.The rope-and-pulley system.Farther upstream, Dr. Smith cast what looked like three small, round life preservers into the river. At $3,000 each, they were equipped with waterproof computers, GPS and sonar depth technology, all to beam back information about the river\u2019s elevation, speed, depth and more. But the drifters were on kamikaze missions. After sending back the measurements, they would be swept into the moulin.\u201cThat\u2019s 3,000 taxpayer dollars, going down the hole,\u201d Dr. Smith said.On the edge of the camp, Johnny Ryan, a doctoral candidate in geography at Aberystwyth University in Wales, launched an airplane-shaped drone from a slingshot-like device, then guided it over a nearly 75-square-mile area. But then the drone went silent. \u201cIt stopped talking to me, and now it\u2019s crashed in the wilderness,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Mr. Ryan, who wore a hot-pink knit cap and purple sunglasses that set off his bright red beard, launched his backup drone. Feeling stressed, he monitored its flight nervously as the hours rolled by, drinking cups of tea to keep warm.At the riverbank, Mr. Overstreet and Mr. Pitcher started the data collection by clipping a computer device that looked like a boogie board to the line running across the river. Every hour they sent it back and forth to measure the water\u2019s depth, velocity and temperature.Inside a tent.But as the day stretched into night, the device\u2019s battery, sapped by the cold, began to die. By now the sun had dropped lower, filling the sky with a spectacular orange glow. The scientists were worried \u2014 the death of the battery would mean the death of their mission.An idea occurred to Mr. Overstreet. He found a roll of heat-reflecting silver sheeting at the camp and wrapped it around the boogie board battery. During the next run across the river, it stayed alive.But the battery continued to wane, so Mr. Pitcher pulled out gel hand warmers from his gloves and tucked them into the battery\u2019s silver jacket. Success. The battery stayed warm and functional.For the rest of their time on the ice, the scientists would have to ration the hand warmers. Saving the life of the battery would save the mission to record the first comprehensive on-the-ground, empirical data on the flow of a river off the ice sheet.The scientists will use the data, which they expect to publish in the coming months, to test whether climate models are accurate.With both sets of data, the scientists can help create the most accurate projections to date of the rate of sea level rise.They might even learn, Dr. Smith said, that the water is refreezing within the ice sheet and that sea levels are actually rising more slowly than models project.For three days and three nights, the scientists continued to measure the river, as up to 430,000 gallons of water a minute poured off the ice and into the moulin. On the final morning, the team, tired but elated, gathered by the river as the boogie board made its final trip. By then, Mr. Ryan\u2019s backup drone had safely completed its mapping mission. Mr. Overstreet broke open a celebratory bag of dried mangoes \u2014 a lavish treat for the ice campers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make the choice to come on projects like this, but everything in my life has prepared me to come out here,\u201d Mr. Overstreet said. \u201cWe go from battling the river to working with it, and then we learn so much from it.\u201dTimes InsiderFlying a Drone Above Greenland\u2019s Ice SheetSources: Ginny Catania, Vena Chu, Paul Morin, Thomas Mote, Johnny Ryan, Laurence Smith, and \u201cEfficient meltwater drainage through supraglacial streams and rivers on the southwest Greenland ice sheet\u201d, PNAS (moulin flow rates).

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Running China\u2019s Economy?", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "Advertisement\nMixed policy signals from China \u2013 on the stock market, currency and financial reform \u2013 have unnerved global investors and prompted central bankers to shift strategies. Here are five officials who are calling the shots in Beijing. The head of the central bank in China since 2002, Mr. Zhou is the world\u2019s longest serving governor of a major central bank. Fluent in English and an admirer of Western classical music, he has long been a public face of Chinese financial reform to the outside world; that status has helped him stay in office despite having surpassed the retirement age for officials of 65 (he\u2019s now 67). As a princeling, or son of a senior Communist Party figure, his voice also carries added weight within China. Mr. Zhou has been busy pushing for a more freely traded renminbi, which if successful would have huge implications for China and its main trade partners, including the United States. A former banking chief, Mr. Xiao is an outspoken critic of nontraditional finance. He once famously described the rapid growth of China\u2019s loosely regulated shadow finance sector as \u201cfundamentally a Ponzi scheme.\u201d At the central bank, Mr. Xiao and Mr. Zhou both served under Zhu Rongji, the prime minister in the late 1990s and early 2000s who led sweeping overhauls of the country\u2019s banking sector and state-owned companies. Mr. Xiao, who took over the securities agency in 2013, has faced criticism in China for not acting fast enough to curb the speculative excesses that helped drive the run-up in share prices. His agency has since responded with an aggressive crackdown on short sellers. At the same time China\u2019s anti-corruption agency has also taken aim at securities officials.After becoming head of the finance ministry in 2013, he has focused on technical fiscal reforms as well as the high levels of local government debt.

{"Headline": "Grace Lee Boggs, Human Rights Advocate for 7 Decades, Dies at 100", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace Lee Boggs, one of the nation\u2019s oldest human rights activists, who waged a war of inspiration for civil rights, labor, feminism, the environment and other causes for seven decades with an unflagging faith that revolutionary justice was just around the corner, died on Monday at her home in Detroit. She was 100.Her death was confirmed by Alice Jennings, her friend and legal trustee.Born to Chinese immigrants, Ms. Boggs was an author and philosopher who planted gardens on vacant lots, founded community organizations and political movements, marched against racism, lectured widely on human rights and wrote books on her evolving vision of a revolution in America.Her odyssey took her from the streets of Chicago as a tenant organizer in the 1940s to arcane academic debates about the nature of communism, from the confrontational tactics of Malcolm X and the Black Power movement to the nonviolent strategies of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and finally to her own manifesto for change \u2014 based not on political and economic upheavals but on community organizing and resurgent moral values.In 1953, she moved to Detroit and married James Boggs, a black autoworker, writer and radical activist. The city, with its large black population, racial inequalities and auto industry in its postwar heyday, seemed poised for changes, and the couple focused on African-Americans, women and young people as vanguards of a social movement.For years they also identified closely with Black Power advocates across the country. Malcolm X stayed with them on visits to Detroit. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was said to have monitored their activities. When arson fires and rioting erupted in the city in 1967, Ms. Boggs described the violence as a rebellion against rising unemployment and police brutality.\u201cWhat we tried to do is explain that a rebellion is righteous, because it\u2019s the protest of a people against injustice,\u201d she told Mr. Moyers. But the violence, she said, also became \u201ca turning point in my life, because until that time I had not made a distinction between a rebellion and revolution.\u201dMs. Boggs eventually adopted Dr. King\u2019s nonviolent strategies and in Detroit, which remained her base for the rest of her life, fostered Dr. King\u2019s vision of \u201cbeloved communities,\u201d striving for racial and economic justice through nonconfrontational methods. As Detroit\u2019s economy and population declined sharply over the years, Ms. Boggs became a prominent symbol of resistance to the spreading blight.She founded food cooperatives and community groups to support the elderly, organize unemployed workers and fight utility shut-offs. She devised tactics to combat crime, including protests outside known crack houses, and in columns for a local weekly newspaper, The Michigan Citizen, she promoted civic reforms.Grace Lee was born above her father\u2019s Chinese restaurant in Providence, R.I., on June 27, 1915. Her father, Chin Lee, later owned a popular restaurant near Times Square in Manhattan. Although illiterate in English, her mother, Yin Lan Lee, was a strong feminist role model.Grace Lee grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens. A brilliant scholar, she enrolled at 16 at Barnard College, graduated in 1935 with a degree in philosophy, and in 1940 earned a doctorate from Bryn Mawr College.Influenced by the German philosophers Kant and especially Hegel, a precursor of Marx, she resolved to devote her life to change in a nation of inequalities and discrimination against minorities and women. In 1941, discouraged about prospects for a college teaching position, she found a library job at the University of Chicago, and she was soon organizing protests against slum housing.In 1945 she published her first book, \u201cGeorge Herbert Mead: Philosopher of the Social Individual,\u201d about the American scholar regarded as a founder of social psychology.Returning to New York, she immersed herself in radical politics, joined socialist groups and wrote for leftist publications. But it was her marriage to Mr. Boggs and her move to Detroit that transformed her political philosophies into life as an activist.Ms. Boggs and her husband, who died in 1993, had no children. No immediate family members survive. In her last book, Ms. Boggs aligned herself with revolutionaries in the spirit of Thoreau, Gandhi and Dr. King. \u201cWe are not subversives,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are struggling to change this country because we love it.\u201dDaniel E.

{"Headline": "U.S. Graft Inquiries Turn to Venezuelan Oil Industry ", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh-ranking Venezuelan government officials, including some at the oil giant, used shell companies, fake contracts and import scams to camouflage the illicit movement of more than $4 billion through a European bank accused of being a money-laundering haven, according to a Treasury Department investigation.These cases and others like them show how American investigators are increasingly focusing on Venezuelan officials suspected of corruption, including officials at the government-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. The cases have come together as American officials are stepping up investigations into narcotics trafficking that frequently involve government corruption as well.The inquiries have opened a window into what is believed to be widespread corruption at the oil company and elsewhere in Venezuela, which received a bonanza of petrodollars during the boom years when oil prices soared to more than $100 a barrel.The concern in Washington over corruption in Venezuela, one of the largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, comes from the top. When President Obama ordered sanctions in March against Venezuelan officials responsible for human rights violations, he directed the Treasury Department to also target officials involved in corruption.Administration officials say the White House insisted on adding the focus on graft, going beyond what was sought in a law passed by Congress that called for sanctions only on human rights violators.Federal officials have not announced any indictments, but the possibility that American prosecutors might file charges against high-level Venezuelan oil officials is causing alarm among American oil companies that do business with the government-run corporation.With Venezuela desperate to increase revenue as oil prices have plummeted to less than half their levels last year, Pdvsa has slowly been moving away from the leftist government\u2019s hostile public posture toward American oil companies. It has begun to offer them more attractive terms and has signaled a greater willingness to work closely with companies in the United States, which has historically been the largest buyer of the country\u2019s crude oil.But oil executives fear that those overtures could end if the United States is seen to be targeting Pdvsa officials over corruption.\u201cIn this town people talk a lot about that happening,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, a center of the American oil industry. He said oil executives were encouraged by the signs that Pdvsa was seeking to work more closely with American companies, but he added, \u201cThey\u2019re worried that will totally collapse, by the rumors they hear that a lot of the investigations that are happening around Venezuela have Pdvsa in the middle of it.\u201dTreasury officials said their inquiry into the Andorra Bank case was continuing with the help of criminal investigators at the Justice Department.The Treasury Department said that more than $4 billion from Venezuela, at least half of it from Pdvsa, had passed through the bank in a variety of fraudulent schemes and that at least $50 million of that had gone through the American financial system.The Treasury Department alleged that the schemes involved high-ranking government officials in Venezuela and that the money launderers used shell companies, fake contracts, mischaracterized loans and overstated imports and exports to camouflage their actions.The authorities in Andorra ordered a takeover of the bank. But the bank\u2019s principal owners said they would fight the takeover and have denied the accusations made by the Treasury Department, saying they had alerted regulators of potentially inappropriate transactions.Another recent investigation, involving a Venezuelan hedge fund operator based in Connecticut, uncovered corruption allegations involving Pdvsa\u2019s pension funds.According to papers filed by a court-appointed receiver who is seeking to recover money for defrauded investors, the hedge fund operator, Francisco Illarramendi, paid at least $30 million in bribes to Pdvsa officials to steer at least $100 million in pension money into his hedge fund and to give him access to profitable bond and currency transactions from 2006 to 2010.Federal prosecutors also alleged that Mr. Illarramendi had bribed Pdvsa officials in exchange for investments in his funds.The receiver filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut against a former high-level Pdvsa finance manager, Juan S. Montes, saying that he had received the bribe money and passed on part of it to other oil company officials, although it does not name them. Mr. Montes, who went by the nickname Black in an effort to avoid detection by investigators, later quit Pdvsa and moved to Florida, according to the documents.Papers filed in the lawsuit indicate that the case against Mr. Montes was settled, but the terms of the settlement were not made public.Elliot Greenfield, a lawyer for Mr. Montes, refused to comment on the case.Venezuela sits atop the world\u2019s largest estimated oil reserves, and oil has made up more than 95 percent of export revenue in recent years.Pdvsa is widely seen to be corrupt, and foreign companies and consultants that regularly do business with it in Venezuela say requests for kickbacks are common.From 2004 until last year the company was run by Rafael Ram\u00edrez, a former confidant of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the longtime leftist president, who died in 2013.Mr. Ram\u00edrez, who put family members in important positions in the company, became one of Venezuela\u2019s most powerful people. He also served for years as energy minister, and for a time he also held the post of vice president in charge of the economy under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was elected to succeed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.But he was eventually pushed out of Mr. Maduro\u2019s inner circle and stripped of his cabinet posts and his job as the head of Pdvsa. He is now Venezuela\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, a post that gives him diplomatic immunity in the United States.A top Pdvsa executive who was said to be close to Mr. Ram\u00edrez was arrested this year in Venezuela and charged with acts of corruption involving oil company contracts, officials there said in April. The executive, Jos\u00e9 Luis Parada, was the head of operations in the western part of the country and was previously a top official in the oil company\u2019s procurement arm.Mr. Ram\u00edrez agreed to an interview last week but canceled at the last minute when his aides said he was sick.Mr. Ram\u00edrez responded with a series of posts on Twitter, saying, \u201cToday the infamy and the misery of the enemies of the people use big media to attack my name and Commander Ch\u00e1vez.\u201dMost corruption cases come to the attention of American officials if the American banking system is used to move illicit funds, if bribes are paid by American companies or if other American laws are broken.Louise Story contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Putin\u2019s Syria Intervention, Fear of a Weak Government Hand", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisOn the night of Dec. 5, 1989, Vladimir V. Putin, then a lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B., watched with alarm as thousands of East Germans in Dresden swarmed the riverside compound of the dreaded secret police, the Stasi.The Berlin Wall had been breached the month before, and the Communist government that had ruled East Germany since the end of World War II gasped its last breaths as protesters took to the streets across the country. The young officer and future Russian president, just 37 at the time, could only stand by helplessly at the K.G.B.\u2019s Dresden outpost a few hundred feet away.The takeover of the Stasi headquarters was relatively peaceful, but in Mr. Putin\u2019s mind the crowd was frenzied, deranged and dangerous, and the experience that night haunted him like nothing else in his mostly undistinguished career as an intelligence officer. \u201cI felt it like a fault of my own,\u201d he told one of his oldest friends, Sergei Roldugin.East Germany soon ceased to exist, as did the Soviet Union following the abortive putsch in August 1991, suffering from an affliction that Mr. Putin described as \u201ca paralysis of power.\u201dThat diagnosis has been a driving force in his consolidation of political power, and it does much to explain Russia\u2019s forceful intervention last week to bolster the besieged government of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. The specter of mass protest \u2014 of mob rule \u2014 is one that has haunted Mr. Putin throughout his political life, and that fear lies at the heart of his belief in the primacy of state authority above all else, both at home and abroad.The East Germans considered their protests an expression of popular will, just as many Syrians did when protests against Mr. Assad\u2019s government began in 2011. But Mr. Putin viewed them as an unlawful usurpation of government authority. And that, in his mind, leads inexorably not to positive political change, but rather to chaos.\u201cOf course, political and social problems have been piling up for a long time in this region, and people there wanted change,\u201d Mr. Putin said at the United Nations on Monday, where he spoke for the first time in a decade. \u201cBut what was the actual outcome?\u201dThe collapse of the Soviet Union and the chaos that followed darkened Mr. Putin\u2019s opinion of freewheeling democracy \u2014 and of the character of his own constituents. He was deeply ambivalent about the protests that hastened the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and as an obscure mayoral aide in St. Petersburg, cheered Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s forceful response to the political uprising in the constitutional crisis of 1993, which culminated in the shelling of the Parliament.In 1998, as the head of Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s security council, Mr. Putin had to mediate an electoral dispute in the southern region of Karachayevo-Cherkessia to prevent violence erupting between rival ethnic groups. The lesson he said he learned was that only the strong hand of the state could avoid the economic and political chaos that consumed Russia in the 1990s. That belief is widely shared in Russia, and is one reason for Mr. Putin\u2019s genuine popularity at home.\u201cThe Russian people are backward,\u201d he told a group of foreign academics in 2005, according to Marie Mendras\u2019s account in \u201cRussian Politics: The Paradox of a Weak State.\u201d \u201cThey cannot adapt to democracy as they have done in your countries. They need time.\u201dThis distrust of popular will has been the justification for laws that have throttled dissent at home. With each election, the Kremlin has tightened the rules governing political parties and public gatherings. When tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets to protest fraud in the parliamentary election in 2011 and Mr. Putin\u2019s own re-election in 2012, the Kremlin responded forcefully to stanch the contagion.The police arrested and convicted dozens of protesters over the next two years, while the authorities harassed the most prominent leaders of the opposition, like the anti-corruption crusader Aleksei Navalny.And in February, Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was assassinated outside the Kremlin.What is striking, though perhaps consistent, is how Mr. Putin\u2019s view of public protest has become the basis for an increasingly assertive foreign policy, one aimed at countering what he views as efforts by the United States and others to violate the sovereignty of nations by encouraging political change.Mr. Putin considered United States support for the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d that swept former Soviet republics \u2014 Georgia in 2002, Ukraine in 2004 and Kyrgyzstan in 2005 \u2014 as evidence of an American policy to topple governments in what had historically been Russia\u2019s sphere of influence.And fear of the \u201ccolor\u201d contagion \u2014 color, as in the orange worn by supporters of Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor A. Yushchenko \u2014 contributed to the deterioration of political freedoms in Russia. Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington noted in a report released on Friday that these popular uprisings have been studied by Russia\u2019s military commanders as \u201ca new U.S. and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other states as a means of serving their security interests at a low cost and with minimal casualties.\u201dThe civil war in Syria, in that view, is merely the latest in a series of messy conflicts that arise from the toppling or weakening of central authority through American aggression. Previous instances include the American war in Iraq that overthrew Saddam Hussein, and NATO\u2019s military intervention in Libya in 2011.The events in Libya proved decisive in Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency after stepping aside, at least formally, in accordance with the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms. With his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dmitri Medvedev, in the Kremlin at the time, Russia acquiesced to a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorized the use of force against the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Milder than his mentor, and less suspicious of hidden motives, Mr. Medvedev had been far more amenable to cooperation with the West. He even expressed sympathy for the democratic aspirations of those who had taken to the streets in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, saying governments would \u201close their real foundation\u201d if they did not address protesters\u2019 grievances.When the Qaddafi government violently repressed the protests in Libya, Mr. Medvedev was moved by the humanitarian appeals of his American and European counterparts. He instructed Russia\u2019s representative at the United Nations to abstain from the resolution, allowing the American and NATO air campaign that ultimately toppled Mr. Qaddafi.Mr. Putin was furious, and said so, prompting the most public breach in the \u201ctandem\u201d of power that governed the country from 2008 to 2012. \u201cIt reminds me of a medieval call to crusade,\u201d he said of the resolution, denouncing the war as another manifestation of American hegemony that, left unchecked, would spread.According to several officials close to the Kremlin, Mr. Medvedev\u2019s dangerous irresolution was a decisive factor in Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to return to the presidency, which he announced six months later. Since his return, Russia has blocked resolution after resolution against Syria\u2019s government, prompting criticism that its intransigence has only worsened the conflict.By the time protests erupted again in Ukraine in the winter of 2013 and 2014, Mr. Putin was firmly back in the presidency. The upheaval seemed to him the continuation of an aggressive foreign incursion that was marching inexorably to the Kremlin itself. (That argument ignored the indigenous grievances that drew Ukrainians to the streets.)\u201cAny citizen has a right to express their opinion about the decisions made, but this must be kept within the law,\u201d he said when the protests began.Last week at the United Nations, he said \u201cthe people\u2019s widespread frustration with the government was used for instigating a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat from abroad.\u201dMr. Putin used the chaotic flight of Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in February 2014 to justify annexation of Crimea and support of the armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine that has splintered the country and led to more than 7,000 deaths.Many have variously interpreted Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention in Syria as a response to domestic pressures caused by an economy faltering with the drop in oil prices and sanctions imposed after Crimea; a desire to change the subject from Ukraine; or a reassertion of Russia\u2019s position in the Middle East.All are perhaps factors, but at the heart of the airstrikes is Mr. Putin\u2019s defense of the principle that the state is all powerful and should be defended against the hordes, especially those encouraged from abroad. It is a warning about Russia, as much as Syria.\u201cNations shouldn\u2019t be forced to all conform to the same development model that somebody has declared the only appropriate one,\u201d he declared at the United Nations. The Soviet Union, he said, had once sought to export \u201csocial experiments, pushing for changes in other countries for ideological reasons, and this often led to tragic consequences and caused degradation instead of progress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan, Despite Gloomy Forecast, Resists New Steps", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s central bank said on Friday that the economic outlook was worsening, but its governor said that the stimulus measures already in place, while slow to take effect, were enough for now.Even with the benchmark interest rate at virtually zero and the bank already buying up trillions of yen of government debt, some economists had expected the bank to ratchet up its efforts in response to a softening Japanese economy. But the Bank of Japan\u2019s rate-setting board voted 8 to 1 to leave its monetary program unchanged.The governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, defended the decision to stand pat, saying the bank was already doing enough to stimulate the economy. But he acknowledged that its efforts were taking longer to bear fruit than he had hoped.\u201cGiven that the labor market is tight and corporate profits are high, wages aren\u2019t rising as much as expected,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference after the board maintained the pace of debt-buying at 80 trillion yen a year, or about $660 billion. \u201cWe want a balanced economy, where prices, wages and profits rise in tandem.\u201dMr. Kuroda said he nonetheless saw a \u201cpositive cycle\u201d taking hold in the economy, even if recent data had been less than encouraging. The board\u2019s latest price forecasts implied a further six-month delay in reaching the bank\u2019s inflation target of 2 percent, but \u201cthe inflationary trend is rising, without question,\u201d he said.The board\u2019s meeting on Friday was the most intensely watched by investors in months, although Mr. Kuroda had been playing down the possibility of any policy change.The Nikkei 225 stock average fell briefly after the bank announced its decision but rallied later to end the day 0.8 percent higher. The yen weakened slightly against the dollar.The central bank \u201csees the inflation glass half-full\u201d and prefers to wait on any new stimulus measures, analysts at Japan Macro Advisors, a research firm, wrote in a report.By injecting money into financial markets through the bond-buying program, the central bank has been trying to keep borrowing costs low, encourage spending and promote inflation and growth.Both the Japanese central bank and the United States Federal Reserve are weighing changes to monetary policy, but the changes would take them in opposite directions. The Fed has cut back its own bond-buying program in response to recovery in the American economy, and it is now considering whether to raise its benchmark interest rate from close to zero.The decision by the Bank of Japan to leave the scale of that program unchanged came despite a slowdown in consumer prices that has threatened a return to deflation, or broadly falling prices \u2014 the bank\u2019s nemesis for much of the past two decades.On Friday, the government said core consumer prices \u2014 a measure traditionally used by the central bank that leaves out volatile fresh-food prices but includes the cost of energy \u2014 had fallen 0.1 percent in September. By other measures, including an index by the University of Tokyo that looks at supermarket prices, inflation remains in positive territory.Mr. Kuroda set the target of \u201croughly 2 percent\u201d core inflation soon after his appointment as the central bank\u2019s governor in 2013 and said at the time that it would be reached by the spring of this year. That timetable has since receded.The board\u2019s latest forecasts imply that the target will not be reached until late 2016 or early 2017. Members\u2019 median forecast for core consumer price increases in the fiscal year starting next April declined to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent in their previous forecasts in July. The median forecast for overall economic growth in the same period slipped to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent.Advertisement"}

Indonesia is open for investors.\u201dIf Indonesia, a G20 member with about a $1 trillion economy, were to join the trade agreement, it would be a boon for Washington.The agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is seen as a bulwark against Chinese influence in the region. Without Indonesia, it would already wrap in two-fifths of the world\u2019s economy, including the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations.The Indonesian trade minister, Thomas Lembong, has said that Indonesia could be ready to join within two years. He has expressed concern that the country could fall behind its neighbors who have joined the accord, including Australia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. The pact must be approved by Congress.But other members of Mr. Joko\u2019s cabinet, as well as some lawmakers, have expressed pessimism, leaving the Indonesian president with a tough decision.\u201cAfter I discuss it with President Obama, I will decide,\u201d Mr. Joko said in the interview on Thursday. \u201cReally. Wait and see.\u201dThe main focus of the visit is trade \u2014 Mr. Joko is seeking billions of dollars in foreign investment \u2014 and he and Mr. Obama are expected to announce several business deals.Since Mr. Joko took office a year ago, his government has added to the mire of regulations, requiring that foreigners be proficient in the Indonesian language, Bahasa, to keep their work permits, that multinational companies employ 10 Indonesians for every foreigner on their staff, and that visiting foreign businesspeople obtain a special permit to hold meetings at their companies\u2019 Indonesian offices. The last regulation has forced some executives to meet in restaurants in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, or in neighboring Singapore.In July, Mr. Joko\u2019s government drastically increased tariffs on more than 1,000 import items ranging from automobiles to condoms to judo belts.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of questions from the business community about the business climate here,\u201d Robert O. Blake Jr., the American ambassador to Indonesia, said at a briefing here Wednesday.Mr. Joko, however, said his government had already changed course and had begun clearing away obstacles that have frustrated foreign businesses.In August, with the economy growing at its slowest pace since 2009, the currency, the rupiah, at its lowest level since the late 1990s, and his own popularity sinking, he reshuffled his cabinet, replacing key economic ministers.Since then his government has released five separate deregulation packages, including rules to simplify and reduce the permitting processes, a new formula to calculate minimum wages, and tax reform.That was just the beginning, he said. \u201cMaximum, every two weeks we will have a new economic package\u201d to deregulate the economy, he said.He said there had been resistance to the changes within the bureaucracy, with its corruption, red tape and a mistrust of foreigners. \u201cBut we must be consistent that we are serious to simplify business permits, to simplify our bureaucracy,\u201d he said.Foreign businesses here have welcomed the moves, saying that they will equally benefit Indonesia, while calling for more deregulation.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame the Indonesians for wanting foreigners to learn to speak Bahasa,\u201d said Brian Arnold, an adviser with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Jakarta and current president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia. \u201cBut if Indonesia wants to be competitive with its neighbors, that just creates another obstacle.\u201dMurray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Indonesia\u2019s size made it a prize for foreign investment.\u201cBut compared to Vietnam or Singapore, it\u2019s a tough place to do business,\u201d he said.Mr. Joko nonetheless has high hopes for his visit, especially for American investment in Indonesia\u2019s e-commerce sector, which analysts say could see tens of billions of dollars in new investment in the next five years. He is scheduled to fly to San Francisco on Wednesday to tour Silicon Valley, visit the headquarters of Google, and have dinner with Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple.In Washington, Mr. Joko and Mr. Obama are expected to sign memorandums of understanding on maritime and defense cooperation, and energy. Mr. Blake said the two leaders would also discuss increasing cooperation in countering violent extremism and climate change, and the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.China has recently acted aggressively to bolster its maritime claims in the region, including by creating islands in disputed territory, which conflict with claims by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2002, China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed to establish a code of conduct in the South China Sea, but to date no document has been finalized.Mr. Joko said he wanted Indonesia, which is not a claimant to the disputes, to use its neutrality to push for a code to be signed as soon as possible.\u201cDialogue is very important to solve this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must start detailing the contents\u201d of the code \u201celement by element, and implement them. It\u2019s been too long \u2014 13 years.\u201dIn the interview, he also reflected on his first year in office, which analysts say has been rocky. Mr. Joko, a slum child who made history by being his country\u2019s first president not to come from the political elite or the military, followed through on campaign promises to eliminate fuel subsidies, and provide free health care and financial support for education for the poor.But his commitment to fighting corruption in one of the most graft-ridden nations in Asia was questioned when he nominated a police general implicated in corruption as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official.The excitement he had generated, especially among the working class who mobbed him at campaign rallies like a rock star, has waned. A poll released last Tuesday put his approval rating at 52 percent, up from a low of 41 percent in June but far below his peak of 72 percent immediately after his election.Tall, thin and unassuming, he smiled when asked about his approval numbers. He said the public was angry that gasoline prices had risen and the economy had slowed, for which he blamed the global economic crisis.\u201cI knew our popularity would go down,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter we can manage the economic situation, and when economic growth is going up again, I\u2019m sure it will go up again.\u201dThe elimination of fuel subsidies has allowed him to divert tens of billions of dollars to big-ticket infrastructure projects including highways, ports, dams and irrigation, which he is counting on to rejuvenate the economy. He said that new central bank figures, which have not yet been published, show the country\u2019s growth rate increasing slightly in the third quarter to 4.85 percent, suggesting that an economic recovery may have already begun.Whether or not Indonesians approve of his job performance, he said, they should not expect all his promises to be fulfilled overnight.\u201cWhen we want to build a house, the first thing is to make the foundation, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you ask for the roof first, it\u2019s difficult for me to answer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A data-driven exploration of future-ready economies.  San Jose\u2019s neighbor to the north \u2014 the metro region that includes San Francisco and Oakland \u2014 ranked No. 2. The nation\u2019s capital, Washington, D.C., Boston and Austin, Tex., rounded out the top five regions in the Dell Future Ready Economies Model.  The survey defined future readiness by examining three categories: the engagement and education of residents, innovation in commerce and government, and the state of the region\u2019s infrastructure. About 40 data points were analyzed to calculate the rankings.  The categories were determined during a conference on the campus of Harvard University that explored the nature of innovation and attempted to find common themes among communities that are well\u2010known for their innovative programs. City officials, entrepreneurs, scholars and technologists from around the world contributed to the discussion at the 2015 Strategic Innovation Summit: Enabling Economies for the Future gathering, which was sponsored by Dell.  One theme was how cities, once innovation takes hold, find themselves in a virtuous cycle. Educated and engaged citizens are drawn to the communities by jobs, cultural activities and social opportunities. More businesses move in to take advantage of the talent. And more people relocate, bringing even more ideas, innovation and economic vitality.  \u201cThe new city is about attracting people, and that&aposs where the innovations come from,\u201d said Karen Campbell, senior consultant at IHS Economics, which conducted the survey on behalf of Dell. \u201cIt&aposs about getting a mix of people there who can bring new perspectives and new ideas.\u201d  The San Jose area has been experiencing the innovation cycle for decades. Just 50 years ago, it was known largely for its orchards, sleepy suburbs and proximity to universities.  But after World War II, those schools were hotbeds of innovation attracting people well\u2010versed in technologies such as the newly invented transistor. Students and professors alike started companies that attracted more people and ideas. Transistors led to integrated circuits, which led to microprocessors and storage chips. An entire industry emerged to harvest the power of silicon chips through hardware and software.  In the IHS study, San Jose and its surrounding communities scored well above the average of all the ranked cities in what the researchers called human capital, particularly the strength of its labor force and the educational achievements of its residents. It ranked the highest, by far, in science, technology, engineering and math occupations per capita.  In the commerce category, which captured data on business and local government innovation, San Jose topped all other cities. These results were driven by high scores for overall productivity, innovation/investment and growth.  The San Jose area, however, fared relatively poorly for infrastructure. Though its ranking for high\u2010 speed Internet availability was high, its numbers slipped due to traffic congestion, highways, public transportation and energy accessibility.  San Jose\u2019s infrastructure \u201cgives other metro areas an opportunity to move ahead,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey can attract people with the good infrastructure that they might be building.\u201d  The No. 2 region, San Francisco\u2010Oakland, ranked slightly lower in terms of human capital and infrastructure than San Jose. Its commerce rating was weighed down by lower growth forecasts, while high housing costs affected human capital, Campbell said.  \u201cSan Francisco is not expected to grow as much. Maybe they&aposre not as up\u2010and\u2010coming as some of the newer metros,\u201d she said. \u201cThey&aposre becoming more of a mature future ready economy. \u201c  No. 3 Washington achieved the highest score among ranked cities for human capital \u2014 the result of a highly educated young workforce.

{"Headline": "House Republicans\u2019 Budget Bill Deepens Rift as U.S. Debt Deadline Nears", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few Republicans, including three senators, even criticized the bill, saying that it did not go far enough and should have fully repealed the health care law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement. In the House, the vote was 240 to 189, mostly following party lines, but with seven Republicans opposed and one Democrat in favor.\u201cThis reconciliation package, getting it to the president\u2019s desk, is a real, real positive step in ending government-controlled health care in this country,\u201d Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana, said in a speech on the House floor.Democrats rejected that view, noting Mr. Obama\u2019s inevitable veto. And they cited Thursday\u2019s marathon hearing, at which Republicans grilled Hillary Rodham Clinton about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, as further evidence of a Republican House that they said was focused more on political messages than on governing the country.He added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come together to prevent a government shutdown.\u201dOn Thursday, House Republican leaders decided not to bring a measure to the floor that would have imposed an array of conditions on lifting the debt ceiling after they concluded that there was not sufficient consensus among Republicans to adopt it.Beyond the need to raise the debt ceiling, major infrastructure programs expire at the end of the month and require reauthorization, while a temporary spending measure that prevented a government shutdown earlier this month is set to run out on Dec. 11.On Monday, there is also expected to be a highly contentious debate in the House over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, following a rare procedural step in which rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats joined to force House leaders to call a vote on the matter.That small show of bipartisanship was a brief exception to the rancor that characterizes most business in Congress these days. Those divisions were on full display during Friday\u2019s floor debate over the reconciliation package, as Republicans cheered the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThis is a great opportunity to get some awful things off the back of the American public,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois.Many Republicans have been angered by videos that purport to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetuses for use in medical research. Planned Parenthood has said that opponents of abortion rights doctored those videos.House Republicans have undertaken several investigations, and at one point were pressing to include provisions in the temporary spending measure that would have cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Those efforts failed, and Democrats said the push on the reconciliation would have a similar result.House Democratic leaders on Friday held a news conference in which they called on Republicans to swiftly move a measure that lifts the debt ceiling without conditions.\u201cWe have seven legislative days left until we default on the full faith and credit of the United States of America,\u201d said the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. \u201cThis is a very, very serious matter \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s as serious as it gets for our economy, for interest rates.\u201dEven as the Democrats were talking about the debt limit, Republicans were lining up to take ceremonial photographs with Mr. Boehner, a sign of the historic shift that will take place next week. In an initial vote on Wednesday, Republicans are expected to nominate Mr. Ryan to be speaker, with a formal vote on the House floor set for Thursday.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outside Forces Shape European Energy", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyThe European Union is struggling to create what it calls its \u201cenergy union.\u201d This is largely a refinement of existing policies aimed at improving energy security, accelerating the shift to a low-carbon economy and, on a political level, showing that the 28 European Union member states can pull off a new integration project at a time when they are deeply divided on monetary and immigration policy. Much of it, therefore, is inward-looking.Yet Europe\u2019s energy project is also being shaped by outside forces, notably the conflict in Ukraine and the potential threat it poses to the supply of Russian gas to Europe. This was the threat that last year led Donald Tusk, then Polish prime minister and now president of the European Council (composed of European Union heads of government), to call for European Union states to circle their wagons against potential Russian energy blackmail. But if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is seen as the wicked witch in this drama, then President Obama, with his new Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions, could be seen as the fairy godmother to Europe\u2019s energy union. However controversial the Obama plan is domestically, it underpins United States climate pledges for the United Nations climate conference in December in Paris. This leaves the European Union feeling less vulnerable with its go-it-alone climate policy of recent years.Back in 2009, Mr. Obama earned no European thanks for sidestepping the European Union attempt to get the Copenhagen climate summit to approve a binding international protocol to limit emissions. (Because of Senate opposition to the United States signing any international climate treaty, Mr. Obama had no other option.)Since then, Europeans have been spooked by the United States shale revolution, which brought American natural gas prices far below the level of European prices.The Obama administration claims that the Clean Power Plan will ultimately lower electricity costs in the United States. But this will be mainly through energy efficiency rather than the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new carbon caps on American power plants.The United States is bolstering Europe\u2019s energy union in other ways. Much touted though probably overestimated is the contribution of United States shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe\u2019s diversification of its gas sources away from Russia. Certainly East European members of the European Union with ports able to import American liquefied natural gas \u2014 the Baltic states and Poland \u2014 have lobbied for the United States to relax controls on gas exports, and their appeals have resonated with Congress.It is possible that some United States liquefied natural gas will reach Europe, but its more likely destination is Asia, where it will be able to command even higher prices than in Europe. A successful conclusion, if there ever is one, to the European Union and United States negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership could facilitate liquefied natural gas exports to Europe. So far, however, American negotiators have been reluctant to include energy in the trade talks. The European Union fears greater exposure to United States energy-intensive goods, but it would like to include energy raw materials in the negotiations so that Europe can get American liquefied natural gas directly. Ultimately, the United States may have more to offer Europe\u2019s energy union by sharing its low-carbon management experience than its raw materials. A key challenge for Europe is to complete the geographical linking of its 28 national markets through cross-border infrastructure and trading arrangements. Another, more difficult challenge is to integrate wind and solar power into the electricity market. Capacity of the renewables sector grows steadily year by year because of subsidies, but output fluctuates daily because of weather. One solution emphasized in the European Union\u2019s energy union plan is to match this variable supply with flexible demand, which some European Union members like Britain are beginning to experiment with. No one in Europe has more experience with what is called demand response \u2014 paying companies and individuals to turn off or reduce power at times of peak demand or weak supply \u2014 than the PJM Interconnection, a regional organization that runs the grid for its utility member companies in 13 mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. PJM is attracting European attention for its demand curtailment program, which proved more reliable than supply measures in keeping the grid stable during the 2014-15 winter in North America. Another significant difference between Europe and the United States is the latter\u2019s tolerance of different nuclear policies in different states.The only nuclear plants being built in the United States are in Georgia and South Carolina, which under the decentralized United States electricity system have opted for regulation rather than competition in the design of their electricity markets. These states have the right to set electricity tariffs at whatever rate would enable a nuclear constructor to recover its investment, and to protect the regulated utility in question from out-of-state competition. By contrast, there is supposed to be a uniform competitive energy market template across the whole European Union. The existence of competition \u2014 actual or even potential \u2014 makes building a nuclear reactor that may take 10 years to plan and build before it earns a penny a very uncertain business in Europe, while any special national tariff for cost recovery requires state aid approval from the European Commission. Britain has granted Electricit\u00e9 de France a high fixed power price for 35 years to build a new reactor at Hinkley Point, and got approval from Brussels. But Austria, a strongly anti-nuclear state, and several utilities from Germany, which is exiting nuclear power, have challenged the commission\u2019s approval of British state aid in the European Court of Justice. Austria is partly reacting to lobbying by a group of pro-nuclear states \u2014 France, Britain and several east European countries \u2014 to use the energy union plan to rehabilitate nuclear power and to get the European Union\u2019s Euratom nuclear agency to resume financial aid. Some years ago, Euratom and other European Union agencies ceased lending to the nuclear sector, in contrast to the United States government, which offers loan guarantees to utilities wanting to build new reactors. What the European Commission and the Obama administration do share is a similar political problem of governance, of getting European Union and American states to follow their respective energy union and clean power plans. In theory, it should be easier for President Obama, who presides over a single country, but in practice Americans remain far more divided over climate measures than Europeans and have a greater tradition of litigating their differences. In Europe, the consensus for climate action holds, more or less, but no longer for some of the means to achieve it. Britain and some East European states have succeeded in getting national renewable energy targets removed after 2020, leaving only overall and probably unenforceable European Union-wide targets for renewables and energy efficiency. Britain and its East European allies want the energy union to be \u201clight touch and non-legislative,\u201d while Germany and the commission want to ensure there will be some penalty on countries backsliding on clean energy programs. Wrangling over the governance provisions of the energy union will continue this fall. In Paris this December, the European Union and the United States will both need to strike a balance \u2014 pledge enough emission reductions to spur other countries into action, but not more than they can actually deliver.Advertisement"}

A fourth man gave the three men his motorcycle, which was used to carry out the killing on Sept. 28, the commissioner said. Though investigators have yet to arrest anyone suspected of ordering the killing, Mr. Mia said he was certain that the motive was to \u201ckeep the government under pressure.\u201d\u201cWe did not get any evidence and information of militants\u2019 involvement with this murder,\u201d he said.That suggested that the police were focusing on opponents of the ruling Awami League and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\u201cThe killing of the foreigner was planned to create anarchy in the country, to damage the good image of the country in the eyes of the international community,\u201d Mr. Mia said.So far, though, the authorities have not identified any political affiliations among the suspects.Hours after the aid worker, Cesare Tavella, 50, was shot as he was jogging, social media accounts linked to the Islamic State announced that its \u201csecurity detachment\u201d had carried out the killing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors radical Islamic groups online. If true, the murder of Mr. Tavella would have been the first Islamic State attack in Bangladesh.The same social media accounts claimed responsibility for the killing of a Japanese man five days later, and for a bomb that detonated during a procession of Shiite Muslims in Dhaka on Sunday. One person was killed.Several foreign governments, including the United States, have issued warnings to their citizens in Bangladesh, saying foreigners may be under threat there. Much is at stake for Bangladesh, whose economy is largely driven by exports of garments to the West, and buyers typically visit in November to place orders.

{"Headline": "The Next Refugee Crisis: Afghanistan", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 With the war in Afghanistan heating up, thousands of Afghan refugees are fleeing their country. But Iran and Pakistan, which house most of the Afghan refugees from previous cycles of violence, are increasingly unwelcoming. So the new exodus has begun to flow toward Europe, already inundated with Syria\u2019s refugees.Yet these Afghans have attracted little attention from Western policy makers; they do not seem to recognize the Afghans\u2019 desperation, and the challenges their flight poses for Afghanistan, its neighbors and Europe. For Afghans, it is a recurring nightmare. Like previous exoduses going back to the 1970s, this one is stripping the country of precisely the professionals who are vital to its future as a modern state.President Obama has an opportunity to change that on Thursday by putting the issue high on his agenda, and calling international attention to it, when he hosts Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in Washington.The new surge of refugees began with the Taliban\u2019s offensive this year, and intensified after fighting reached populated areas like Kunduz. Last month, employees at Afghanistan\u2019s passport agency said they were issuing an average of 2,000 passports daily \u2014 triple the number of six months ago.In recent decades, most Afghan refugees have wound up in Pakistan, which now hosts nearly three million. But refugees there complain that this year, officials have been forcing them to return home. The International Organization for Migration says 90,000 Pakistan-based Afghans did just that since January. Now the government refuses to extend identity cards for 1.5 million refugees, many of whom have been in Pakistan for decades, when their permits expire at year\u2019s end.Iran, too, has been deporting refugees. One reason is fear that Afghans with ties to the drug trade will compound Iran\u2019s own drug-use problems.Deportation can be a harsh sentence. Some returnees end up in United Nations camps near Jalalabad, a stronghold for former Taliban militants who joined the Islamic State. The danger may be worst for ethnic Hazaras; they are Shiite Muslims, and many fled slaughter by the Taliban.Afghans cannot expect much help from their own government. One official American report says the State Department stopped funding a training program for Afghanistan\u2019s refugee and repatriation ministry last year after finding the ministry corrupt and dysfunctional.Helping Afghan refugees is not an easy issue for Pakistani officials, who already deal with a million internally displaced Pakistanis fleeing conflict in their own border areas.So the Afghan exodus increasingly looks to Europe as its destination, after a perilous trek across Iran, Turkey and the Mediterranean.According to United Nations and European estimates, more than 20 percent of the roughly 500,000 people who have arrived this year via the Mediterranean have been Afghans.The flow poses a serious challenge for Europe, which is already experiencing its greatest refugee crisis since World War II and needs no further scapegoats for its anti-immigration demagogues to attack.But if Europe closes its doors to them, that would only shift the challenge back to Pakistan, where Afghans could be expected to resume arriving in greater numbers. Even in normal times, tens of thousands of Afghans pass back and forth monthly through two border checkpoints, most of them as legitimate temporary visitors. The temptation to cheat at those crossing points would increase even as other desperate Afghans stepped up the flow across more porous parts of the border. That would surely exacerbate a growing public resentment of Afghan refugees, whom many Pakistanis already associate with terrorism, drug abuse and a drag on their economy.So the world must acknowledge the plain fact that Afghanistan\u2019s refugees need help. Their own government, beleaguered by war and its own dysfunction, is not up for the task, and its two largest neighbors are increasingly indifferent to their plight.It is unrealistic to expect Pakistan to voluntarily accept more Afghan refugees. Still, it should better help those already there. Mr. Obama should press Mr. Sharif to extend the identity cards about to expire. He should urge a more gradual and humane repatriation process. And he should assure Mr. Sharif that Americans remain committed to financial support for international aid programs that assist Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran \u2014 programs now under budgetary pressure.Iran, which houses the second-largest Afghan refugee population, has extended the visas of 450,000 Afghans. Yet Afghans there also report forced deportations and other bad treatment. According to one recent report, Iranian border policemen shot and killed seven Afghans trying to enter the country. These policies must end.As for the Western countries, the European nations whose troops took part in NATO\u2019s mission in Afghanistan should ensure that Afghans are included in any European Union quotas that distribute refugees among member states. And Washington should expedite special visas for those Afghans who worked for the United States government or military and say that their lives are endangered. In September, at least 13,000 Afghans and Iraqis with that status were still waiting.And, if security can be assured, international aid groups should accelerate the creation of safe zones within pacified areas in the country, where the United Nations says the total internally displaced population numbers nearly a million. These people need incentives to stay in Afghanistan.Meanwhile, some of Afghanistan\u2019s other neighbors should band together to help. Bordering countries in Central Asia, along with Russia, China and Iran, all need more stability in Afghanistan and fear the specter of heavy refugee flows into their countries; they should pool funds to support the formation of permanent safe areas inside Afghanistan, in places like Bamian Province that still enjoy relative stability.Given the lack of quick fixes for Afghanistan\u2019s violence, corruption and economic distress, safe areas may be the best possible incentive for Afghans to remain in their country. It is only a stopgap, but one that might help keep a dangerous crisis in check.Michael Kugelman is the senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Economy, Republicans Have a Data Problem", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaIn 2004, when fewer people paid attention to him, Donald J. Trump gave CNN a bottom-line assessment of political parties: \u201cIt just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats.\u201dIf that sounds awkward now for Mr. Trump, who leads opinion polls for the Republican presidential nomination, it may be even more awkward for his party next year, because its ability to claim superior economic know-how over Democrats has grown weaker ever since he made that assertion.Like his rivals, Mr. Trump offers the familiar Republican recipe of tax cuts to spur growth and create jobs. But on the economy, Republicans have a data problem.The party still likes to invoke its success under President Ronald Reagan, who cut taxes after defeating Jimmy Carter in 1980. By the mid-1980s, stagflation had turned into an economic boom.But neither of the two subsequent Republican presidents fared as well compared with their Democratic successors. That has left the party vulnerable in three ways.One is the most prominent economic indicators. During the single term of the first President George Bush, growth slowed, while unemployment and budget deficits grew.Those measures improved under his Democratic successor, Bill Clinton. Growth accelerated to an average annual rate of 3.8 percent, exceeding the level under Mr. Reagan. Unemployment fell to 4.2 percent, from the 7.3 percent he inherited. The budget moved from deficit to surplus.They went backward again under President George W. Bush, who cut taxes in his first year. But his second term ended in financial crisis and recession, with unemployment at 7.8 percent. The budget surplus became a trillion-dollar deficit.Growth has remained modest under President Obama, but unemployment has dropped to 5.1 percent since the recession ended five months into his term. The budget deficit as a percentage of the overall economy has fallen to 2.5 percent from 9.8 percent.A second problem for Republicans stems from their own rhetoric. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama pushed through tax increases despite warnings from partisan adversaries. Among many other Republicans, the current presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John R. Kasich and Jeb Bush all denounced the \u201cjob-killing\u201d consequences of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.Yet the economy gained 2.9 million jobs in 2014, more than in any year since 1999, during Mr. Clinton\u2019s term. Net job creation during the 15 years that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama occupied the White House has topped 30 million. That is 50 percent more than were created in the 20 years of Mr. Reagan and both Mr. Bushes.A third problem for Republicans is the comparison between the United States and its international counterparts. As Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure began, the recession in the United States was dragging down other advanced industrial countries.Today, the United States has the strongest major economy in the world. According to data compiled by a Moody\u2019s economist, Mark Zandi, the United States had higher economic and job growth than Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, France and Japan in the 12-month period through June 2015.\u201c\u2018Strongest\u2019 is of course quite different from \u2018strong,\u2019\u201d said Keith Hennessey, an economic adviser to the younger President Bush. Wages for average families have barely budged under presidents of both parties for a generation.In any case, economic data cannot resolve arguments over specific policies. The role of business cycles, technological innovation and demographic change, not to mention Congress and the Federal Reserve, can exceed the influence of presidents on economic performance.In an interview, Jeb Bush argued that the Clinton-era economy benefited from a budget deal that his father forged. His brother\u2019s record, he added, suffered from \u201cbig secular events\u201d like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the bursting of the high-tech bubble.But the language of election argument begins with a simple concept: on whose watch. Which means that, among Mr. Trump\u2019s contentious statements, his words about economy and party may be harder than most to explain away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Commerce Chief Makes a Pitch in Cuba ", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 The United States commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, told Cuban officials on Tuesday that the Obama administration wants to create as many business opportunities as possible in their nation for American companies despite the long embargo and more than five decades of Cold War estrangement.\u201cWe want to make sure that you understand how our regulations work, because I think there\u2019s business opportunity in that,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said as she toured a newly built port and economic development zone in Mariel. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is be as open as we can until the blockade is lifted,\u201d she added, using the term Cubans use for the American laws that have banned most trade and commerce between the two countries.Ms. Pritzker, the first commerce secretary to visit Cuba since 1950, is the second member of Mr. Obama\u2019s cabinet to make the trip since Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00f9l Castro announced last year that they would begin normalizing relations. It comes as American and Cuban commerce and finance officials begin a round of technical discussions of the process this week.Her assignment is a tricky one, highlighting the obstacles to the opening that Mr. Obama has championed. Despite the regulatory changes that have followed the president\u2019s groundbreaking announcement, including new Treasury and Commerce rules to allow more travel and limited business activities between the United States and Cuba, the embargo is still in place, leaving strict limits on the vast majority of commerce, including tourism. \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in \u2014 the president is leaning in \u2014 to this relationship,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said of the Cubans in an interview on Tuesday, \u201cbut we\u2019re limited in what we can do to help them.\u201d\u201cThe signal, hopefully, that they\u2019ll understand is that we\u2019re trying to lean in as far as we can under the law,\u201d she added.On Tuesday, Ms. Pritzker witnessed both the frozen-in-time glamour and the poverty of Cuba, where the average wage is now about $20 a month. She rode on highways dotted with colorful 1950s-era automobiles and palm-tree-lined boulevards replete with stately Spanish colonial homes, then passed ramshackle houses and apartment buildings in communities where shortages of food and other daily necessities are common. She dined on Tuesday night with Cuban entrepreneurs and plans to participate in the technical talks on Wednesday, when she will also meet with senior government ministers. Her mission comes amid questions about how quickly Cuba is willing to make changes in its state-run economy to accommodate closer commercial ties, and whether the impoverished nation could even absorb the onslaught of business that might follow.John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said the Cubans would likely use Ms. Pritzker\u2019s trip as \u201cbait\u201d to further its relationships with other countries, while stalling on making any changes to facilitate business ties with the United States.\u201cHer visit should not have been scheduled until the Cuban government had, at minimum, formally responded to each of the initiatives announced by President Obama since December, and then put into regulation, so this trip is premature,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what our rules are, the Cuban government is unlikely to permit American businesses to have a presence in Cuba. It neither trusts the intentions of U.S. companies nor the intentions of the U.S. government.\u201dTouring the port \u2014 it was financed largely by Brazilian capital, operates on Chinese equipment and is managed by a Singapore firm \u2014 Ms. Pritzker saw firsthand the degree to which the long-running feud between the United States and Cuba has translated into lost American business. \u201cWe do have a certain hamstring in terms of handling traffic from the United States,\u201d one port official told Ms. Pritzker, noting that United States law requires that any foreign shipping vessel that docks in Cuba must wait six months before docking in the United States. \u201cIf you could take that message back to Washington,\u201d he told Ms. Pritzker, \u201cwe\u2019d be thrilled.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misspelled the surname of the United States commerce secretary. She is Penny Pritzker, not Pritchard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen, Hit by Emissions Scandal, Posts Its First Loss in Years", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe day also was the end of a defining era of Volkswagen ambition. Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive, signaled that the company would no longer be focused on becoming the world\u2019s largest carmaker.He said on Wednesday that sales would cease to be an overriding measure of success. In another shift, he also said that top executives at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, who had been criticized for micromanaging, would no longer get involved in details of product design.Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s statement represents a clear break from his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in late September after the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States disclosed that Volkswagen diesel cars were equipped with software that could detect when a car was being tested and crank up pollution controls.After he became chief executive in 2007, Mr. Winterkorn declared his determination to make Volkswagen the world\u2019s largest carmaker, overtaking Toyota. He was known for his intense attention to the technical fine points of the vehicles the company produced.\u201cA lot of things were subordinated to the desire to be faster, higher, larger,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said in a conference call with analysts and reporters on Wednesday. He also said, \u201cI have no intention of intervening in the details of product design.\u201dMr. Winterkorn\u2019s management style, coupled with a relentless drive for growth, is cited by some critics of the company as a contributing factor to the scandal by impeding open communication and perhaps causing subordinates to cheat rather than admit failure.The earnings report on Wednesday provided a first taste of the financial cost to Volkswagen of its past behavior. The company said it had a net loss of $1.84 billion in the third quarter as it set aside a huge sum to help cover the expected damage from the company\u2019s emissions-cheating scandal.It was the first quarterly loss in as long as anyone could remember. A company spokesman said that internal records went back only to 2001. Previously, Volkswagen did not report quarterly earnings. The loss, totaling 1.67 billion euros, was in contrast to a profit of \u20ac2.97 billion in the third quarter of 2014.That sum does not cover the cost of fines Volkswagen is likely to have to pay to the E.P.A. and to other authorities around the world. Volkswagen also faces hundreds of lawsuits from customers who say the company sold them cars based on a false promise.\u201cIt is still far too early to calculate the cost of legal measures,\u201d Frank Witter, the chief financial officer, said in the conference call on Wednesday.The company said it expected profit for full-year 2015 \u201cto be down significantly\u201d from 2014. Volkswagen shares rose on Wednesday, but the stock is down more than 20 percent since the emissions cheating became known on Sept. 18.During tests, the Volkswagen diesel engines with illegal software make full use of pollution controls and can pass emissions tests. But during regular operation, the engines emit many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide.Because the deception became known less than two weeks before the end of the most recent reporting period, the third-quarter results provide only a glimpse of the fallout. Volkswagen executives said on Wednesday that they had not seen any signs that the damage to the company\u2019s reputation from the scandal had kept buyers away from showrooms. But they added they were closely watching for possible negative effects in the months to come.Volkswagen said it had an operating loss of \u20ac3.5 billion in the quarter, compared with an operating profit of \u20ac3.2 billion a year earlier. The loss was partly offset by \u20ac1.5 billion in profit the company received for selling its nearly 20 percent stake in the Japanese vehicle maker Suzuki in September.Sales in the quarter rose 5.3 percent to \u20ac51.5 billion, Volkswagen said, largely because of gains by its Audi, Bentley and Porsche divisions and favorable currency movements. However, the number of vehicles sold slipped to 2.35 million in the quarter from 2.44 million a year earlier.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The recent sales data showed that Volkswagen was vulnerable even before the scandal. Sales have been slumping in China, the company\u2019s largest market, and other important markets like Brazil, which is in a severe recession.Shortly after the conference call Wednesday, Mr. M\u00fcller joined Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on a trip to China. He was expected to brief her on Volkswagen\u2019s response to the scandal.Volkswagen this year briefly surpassed Toyota in the number of cars produced, but has since slipped back to No. 2. Mr. M\u00fcller said that while size was important \u2014 it allowed car companies to spread costs of development over more vehicles \u2014 Volkswagen would put more emphasis on factors like customer satisfaction and profitability.\u201cThe point is not whether we sell 100,000 more or less than a major competitor,\u201d he said.Mr. M\u00fcller said that Volkswagen was conducting its own investigation of how the emissions cheating occurred, but provided no new details on the progress of the inquiry. \u201cWe need to find out the truth and learn from it,\u201d he said.Volkswagen had advertised that its \u201cclean diesel\u201d motors were environmentally responsible while delivering excellent fuel economy and performance. But the deceptive software made that economy and performance possible only by allowing the engines to emit up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide, an air pollutant that can be harmful to lungs.The German government has ordered Volkswagen to recall 8.5 million vehicles in Europe with the software, and the company has said it will repair an additional 500,000 in the United States at no cost to customers. But it remains unclear how the company can make the cars compliant with air quality regulations without also hurting performance and fuel economy.Any fix that hurts the cars\u2019 resale value will provide ammunition to disgruntled customers and their lawyers.Mr. M\u00fcller has raised the possibility of job cuts because of the cost of the scandal and has said Volkswagen will cut spending on new projects. The company employs 614,000 people worldwide.\u201cThe financial burden from the diesel crisis is enormous but manageable,\u201d Mr. Witter, the chief financial officer, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discordant Financial Messages From China Spur Global Unease", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s bungled stock market bailout was a significant setback to its decades-long efforts to build a modern financial system.A highly anticipated package of overhauls to sprawling state-owned companies was a crushing rebuke to hopes that China would move to privatize such businesses. Instead of reducing their stakes, the Communist Party said it would increase its control over such companies.To many global policy makers and investors, China\u2019s spate of surprises is driven by the government\u2019s need to get the economy back on track.While President Xi Jinping says the country is committed to financial reform, the resulting measures send the message that China is backpedaling on those efforts. It is a new and shifting landscape that is proving difficult for the rest of the world to navigate.\u201cPeople say reform is coming, but you\u2019re giving back your reforms,\u201d Fraser Howie, a longtime banker in Asia and co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise,\u201d said of the recent actions by Chinese authorities.\u201cThat defeats the whole purpose; you either embrace markets or not,\u201d he said.For years, the technocrats who control the levers of China\u2019s economy have been heralded as farsighted planners. What they promised, they generally delivered, and any doubts could be dispelled by the nation\u2019s torrid economic growth.Mixed policy signals from China have roiled global investors. Here are five officials who are calling the shots in Beijing.But that image has been shattered in recent months, as an expanding cast of agencies and officials regularly roll out ambitious plans with little warning and explanation. In China, some economic decisions are treated like state secrets, forcing global investors and policy makers to adjust quickly.The People\u2019s Bank of China routinely surprises the market with major policy announcements on evenings and weekends. Its counterpart, the United States Federal Reserve, tries to telegraph its moves long in advance.It is all complicated by the competition and the lack of coordination among the many agencies charged with managing China\u2019s economy. The central bank, securities regulator, Finance Ministry and economic planning agency, among others, have different agendas and goals.The collective result is that it is difficult to discern exactly what is happening in China. From the outside, officials appear to be changing course on long-held reform plans that are broadly considered critical for the health of the economy.In June, China\u2019s chief securities regulator outlined sweeping plans to help turn millions of cash-starved start-up companies into innovative corporate champions by making it easier to raise money and go public. The initiative would \u201cstrengthen the vitality of the entire economy,\u201d Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a financial forum in Shanghai.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.\u201cThe focus on centralizing authority has been a big theme of Xi\u2019s, and also this more politicized and nationalist environment that Xi has inaugurated has had very clear effects on the progress of economic reform,\u201d said Andrew Batson, the China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial consultancy in Beijing.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily 100 percent negative,\u201d Mr. Batson added. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly not the universally pro-market reform agenda that some people were expecting.\u201dThe confusion over the country\u2019s commitment to financial reform has increased volatility far beyond China\u2019s borders.China\u2019s central bank has explained the devaluation on Aug. 11 as a one-time adjustment that was meant to make the currency, whose value had been tightly controlled by the government for years, more market-driven. But the suddenness of the move spurred competitive devaluations in Vietnam and Kazakhstan. The tumult even prompted the Fed to hold off raising interest rates at its Sept. 17 meeting.\u201cI think developments that we saw in financial markets in August in part reflected concerns that there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance, and perhaps concerns about the deftness with which policy makers were addressing those concerns,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told reporters after that meeting.Zhou Xiaochuan, the long-serving head of China\u2019s central bank, has not commented directly on the devaluation. In a recent essay, he argued that China had made impressive progress in financial overhauls over recent decades, but he also acknowledged that the global financial crisis and other factors had delayed some changes.\u201cToday the conditions are there to advance reforms for market changes, internationalization and diversification,\u201d Mr. Zhou wrote in China Finance magazine. \u201cBut in this process, there are some things that require catching up, because there have been planned reforms that, owing to the crisis and other factors, were pigeonholed.\u201dFor China, the risk in delaying promised financial overhauls is that longstanding economic issues, like the country\u2019s ballooning corporate and government debt problem, might get worse.State-controlled media reported on Monday that Prime Minister Li Keqiang had met with the leaders of some of China\u2019s biggest banks on Friday and issued a broad promise to prop up companies in financial trouble. According to the Beijing Times, Mr. Li declared that China \u201cwill not cut or withdraw loans to those companies with difficulties but good market prospects,\u201d and will \u201cgive necessary capital support to companies undergoing bankruptcies or regrouping.\u201dIn October 2014, Lou Jiwei, the finance minister, announced a bold plan to clean up trillions of dollars of local government debts, spending that has traditionally played a major role in China\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy. But policy makers have appeared partly to backtrack, allowing local governments to continue adding new debt through riskier methods like borrowing through unregulated holding companies.\u201cRelative to the plan announced last year, the pace of reform now is slower,\u201d Nicholas Zhu, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service based in Beijing, said of the local government debt efforts. \u201cThe reason is because the sharper-than-expected slowdown of economic growth since earlier this year has changed the policy focus more towards stabilization of the economy.\u201dThe most recent development to set off doubts about China\u2019s commitment to economic reforms came last month, when the government released a much-anticipated policy document on the overhaul of its gigantic state-owned sector.A few days after the proposal was published, the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Central Committee followed up with a document that bluntly ruled out loosening the party\u2019s grip on state firms.Party leadership \u201ccan only be strengthened rather than undermined, as state-owned enterprise reforms have entered the deepwater zone,\u201d the Central Committee document said, according to a report by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency.The party leadership over state firms \u201cis vital in ensuring the socialist direction of their development\u201d and would \u201cenhance their competitiveness and competence,\u201d Xinhua added.Despite signs of stasis on the ground, Chinese officials continue to talk up a pro-reform agenda in public, which adds to the murkiness.On his visit to the United States last month, Mr. Xi, China\u2019s president, repeatedly drove home his commitment to pushing through economic overhauls.\u201cThe key to China\u2019s development lies in reform,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a speech in Seattle.\u201cWhen it comes to the toughest reforms, only those with courage will carry the day,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have the resolve and the guts to press ahead.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen, in Future Cars, to Adopt New System for Controlling Diesel Emissions", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe approach is conceptually similar to an emissions control system that Volkswagen considered until 2007, when it adopted the system now at the center of its scandal. The alternative technology, which is not part of its plan to fix cars already in circulation, was rejected by the company at the time as too costly.Reflecting the scandal\u2019s mounting financial toll, Volkswagen also said on Tuesday that it would cut investments at its leading brand by 1 billion euros, or about $1.1 billion. That will limit the company\u2019s ability to innovate at a time when carmakers are trying to keep ahead of a rush of new technology.Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s leading automaker, was forced to admit that about 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide were equipped with software that allowed it to cheat on tests of noxious gas emissions. The company now faces a raft of investigations in the United States, Europe and China.The change involves adding a tank of a urea-based fluid to clean exhaust and affects only coming models, said Peter Thul, a spokesman for Volkswagen.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\u201cDiesel vehicles will only be equipped with exhaust emissions systems that use the best environmental technology,\u201d Herbert Diess, chairman of the company\u2019s car brand, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, said in a statement on Tuesday. The change will take place \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d according to the statement.It also appears that Volkswagen will be moving away from diesel as its preferred clean technology. Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it was pushing ahead with the development of electric and plug-in hybrid cars based on a series of components that can be used in different models.Exemplifying this shift will be a transformation of the next generation of the company\u2019s luxury Phaeton limousine into an all-electric model, expected to reach showrooms in 2019 or 2020.Last week, Volkswagen submitted a detailed proposal to the authorities here of how it planned to remove from its vehicles in Germany the software used to cheat emissions tests. The Federal Motor Transport Authority is reviewing Volkswagen\u2019s proposal to remedy the issue on its 1.2-, 1.6- and 2-liter diesel engines.The German Transport Ministry has said there will be a recall for affected vehicles, with a software fix for the 2-liter engines expected to be ready early next year. The 1.6-liter motors, however, would require further modifications that cannot be expected before later in 2016. No information has been released regarding a fix for the 1.2-liter engines.In testimony before the United States Congress last week and the British Parliament on Monday, Volkswagen officials indicated that fixes would vary by country, given varying emissions standards.Paul Willis, general manager of the Volkswagen Group in Britain, said on Monday that repairs for diesels sold in Europe would not involve the installation of a new emission filtration system using urea as an additive. But such a remedy is expected in many vehicles in the United States, which has tougher standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which have been linked to a host of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.Fallout from the scandal has ricocheted throughout Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, with a benchmark survey released on Tuesday showing that economic sentiment dropped more than expected in October, to 1.9 points from 12.1 in September.\u201cThe emissions scandal at Volkswagen and sluggish growth in emerging markets are dampening the economic outlook for Germany,\u201d the ZEW research institute, which conducts the monthly survey, said in a statement.Germany\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said on Tuesday that he felt confident the problems at Volkswagen, a source of more than 750,000 jobs in the country, would not inflict permanent damage on the national economy.On Monday, Werner Hoyer, the head of the European Investment Bank, said the institution was checking to see whether Volkswagen had violated its agreements to uphold certain environmental goals.Speaking to the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Mr. Hoyer said that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by Volkswagen\u2019s actions and that the institute he leads would conduct \u201cvery thorough investigations\u201d into how the automaker spent the estimated \u20ac4.6 billion it borrowed from the bank since 1990 for the development of engines with lower emissions.In case of impropriety, he said, the investment bank would consider demanding that the loans be repaid.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Werner Hoyer of the European Investment Bank said the institution was looking into whether Volkswagen had violated its agreements to uphold certain environmental goals. It was Monday, not Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond VW Scandal: Home Appliance Industry No Stranger to Tricks", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe emissions scandal at Volkswagen was the latest instance in the auto industry\u2019s long history of skirting safety or environmental rules, with regulators now vowing to establish more stringent tests.Makers of consumer appliances and electronics have gone down a similar path, but tight federal standards and frequent testing have made it harder for manufacturers to skirt the rules.Still, consumer groups and advocates said regulators must remain vigilant because the pace of technological change and innovation often exceeds the speed at which federal standards can be established. Common household items are packed with more electronics than ever, adding lots of features, but also providing the possibility of deceit.Last week, for instance, Samsung denied that some of its high-definition televisions used less energy during testing conditions than in real-life use. This came after a European Union-financed laboratory raised questions about whether a feature known as \u201cmotion lighting\u201d was intended to game energy efficiency tests.Samsung said the technology, which dimmed the screen\u2019s brightness in some circumstances, was an \u201cout-of-the-box feature\u201d that remained turned on whether at home or during tests. The feature \u201cis not a test-cheat\u201d and helps save energy, the company said in a statement posted online.Noah Horowitz, an energy efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that advanced controls and other types of electronics in many consumer devices and appliances increased the potential for mischief by manufacturers.\u201cVolkswagen has raised everybody\u2019s eyebrows,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cThe reality is that more and more controls and minicomputers are being built in many products, whether appliances, electronics or televisions, and that technology makes it possible to game the tests.\u201dHe added, \u201cOur test methods need to get smarter and become much more resistant to gaming.\u201dMr. Horowitz said some testing performed by his group on new ultrahigh-definition televisions, also known as U.H.D. or 4K TVs, also unveiled what he called unusual behavior in one of the models sold in the United States. Mr. Horowitz would not identify the manufacturer until further testing was performed, but he said the difference in energy consumption between regular use and during tests was significant.\u201cAs this is still a work in progress, it is not appropriate for us to name a manufacturer at this time,\u201d he said.Cheating is not unheard-of. Five years ago, LG sold refrigerators with so-called circumvention devices that activated an energy-saving mode when detecting testing conditions.The deception meant the refrigerators appeared to require much less energy in daily use. After this was discovered, in 2010, LG was forced to strip the Energy Star label from these models and it agreed to compensate consumers to make up for the difference they paid on their power bills.\u201cThere has been a lot of work to make sure the test procedures limit opportunities for gaming, but also performing tests that are more reflective of what is happening in the field,\u201d Ms. Amann said.Five years ago, the Energy Star program came under heavy criticism for rubber-stamping products without vetting them properly. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that the program had granted its label to nonexistent products that auditors submitted, including a gasoline-powered clock and a space heater with a feather duster.Since then, Energy Star, which is certified by the Environmental Protection Agency, has tightened its certification system, set up a network of third-party testing and re-established its credibility, according to consumer advocate groups and manufacturer representatives. The program recognizes the most energy-efficient products in their category, a major selling point for manufacturers who are eager to apply for the label.Unlike standards for automakers, though, the Energy Star program is voluntary.\u201cEven as a voluntary program, it\u2019s been tremendously successful,\u201d said Mark Connelly, a senior director in charge of product testing at Consumer Reports. \u201cIt really simplifies things, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so efficient. And because consumers like this simplicity, manufacturers have really tried to make their products Energy Star compliant.\u201dMark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, praised the changes to the program.\u201cThere is no doubt that the standards programs have been very effective and that well-designed performance standards are very effective,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most of these products, there is very solid government agency oversight and a very significant crowdsourcing enforcement.\u201dAt the same time, the Energy Department has strengthened its testing and compliance methods for minimum energy standards, which are different from the Energy Star program, that must be met for manufacturers of refrigerators, air-conditioners, dishwashers, heaters and many other appliances that account for 90 percent of home energy use.The Environmental Protection Agency conducts routine market-performance testing to check manufacturers\u2019 claims under the Energy Star program, for instance. The Federal Trade Commission and the Energy Department have also increased their activity and can fine manufacturers for false reporting.Since 2010, the Energy Department has tested more than 4,500 products and found that 500 did not meet federal standards, said Kathleen Hogan, the deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency at the Department. These tests were part of a major push by the Obama administration to strengthen its monitoring and oversight and improve its energy-efficiency programs.The Energy Department has also completed new efficiency standards for more than 30 household and commercial products, including dishwashers, refrigerators and water heaters. The department estimates that these would save consumers nearly $522 billion through 2030.\u201cConsumers can be very confident in the efficiency of the appliances they buy,\u201d said Joseph McGuire, president of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, the industry\u2019s trade group.He cautioned that regulators needed to come up with standards and test procedures that manufacturers could perform repeatedly.Government agencies can also rely on another aspect of market self-policing: Appliance makers routinely test their rivals\u2019 products and check their efficiency and performance claims, according to researchers and officials.Testing standards have also improved, and they are updated every three years. For instance, a few years ago, the testing for dishwashers was conducted using mostly clean dishes. But modern dishwashers are equipped with sensors that can automatically adjust their washing cycles based on how dirty their load is.This meant that those new models appeared to be a lot more efficient than when used at home, said Mr. Connelly of Consumer Reports, who has testified about this topic before Congress.That, too, has changed. Dishwasher tests are now conducted with dirty dishes.Advertisement"}

But this does vary by airline.But these freebies and a little extra legroom will get you only so far. A smartly packed carry-on bag is essential.Ms. Mulder recommends taking your own water, a sweatshirt and socks to keep you warm (I never fly without my hoodie), and some of your favorite healthy snacks.\u201cDon\u2019t just eat the free food the flight attendants serve because it\u2019s there,\u201d Ms. Mulder said. \u201cYour body will respond differently to different foods when at altitude.\u201dDry oatmeal and dried fruit are favorites of Ms. Mulder. I\u2019ve found trail mix and protein and granola bars to be safe and sustainable options.I\u2019ve also learned not to be shy. If you napped your way through mealtime or did not pack enough water, take a walk to where the flight attendants are and ask for what you need. You still have 13 hours to go.Nothing puts a damper on a vacation like a blood clot in the knee.Studies have found that long-distance travel increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, and that height is an additional risk factor, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It\u2019s still a rare condition, but the C.D.C. recommends \u201cambulation,\u201d which is a fancy word for walking and thigh exercises, and suggests aisle seats for those who are particularly tall.Even if you\u2019re not concerned about a blood clot, walking and stretching will make you less miserable in general, and there is plenty you can do without even leaving your seat.You do not have to be a yogi to benefit from these stretches. The simplest ones can bring instant satisfaction.For beginners, Mr. Douglas recommends the \u201cLocust Bind\u201d stretch, which involves interlacing your fingers behind your back and drawing your shoulder blades toward each other, and \u201cseated twisting,\u201d placing your hand on your opposite knee or thigh and twisting from the upper back.It may seem hard to do when the toddler behind you is kicking your seat or your neighbor is snoring. \u201cTo help overcome these difficulties, I bring more awareness to my breath or add a simple mantra,\u201d Mr. Douglas said. \u201cSimply recite \u2018inhale let, exhale go\u2019 \u201d mentally as you breathe.\u201dIf there is a silver lining to having 16 hours to kill, it\u2019s that you can at least get something accomplished like work or reading that novel you\u2019ve yet to make a dent in. But it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, especially if you do not plan ahead.You may be distracted by turbulence or the drink cart rolling by, and that first gin and tonic leads to another. Before you know it, you\u2019re poking at the entertainment console and pondering which Adam Sandler movie you haven\u2019t already seen 10 times.\u201cI\u2019m an author and blogger who writes about air travel,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cbut I find it almost impossible to get anything done, even with my subject matter all around me.\u201dCompartmentalizing your time is the way to go, and can make the flight feel much shorter.\u201cDevote blocks of time to certain tasks,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cPick out a couple of movies to watch; that\u2019s three or four hours right there. Spend a couple of hours reading, then a couple of hours napping if you can, and so on.\u201d\u201cI can be on a 12-hour flight and not watch one movie from the plane\u2019s in-flight entertainment system sometimes, simply because I planned out my tasks and airplane relax time so well,\u201d Ms. Mulder said. \u201cThose are good flights.\u201dThat still feels like an oxymoron to folks like me but less so these days.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the professional status of Patrick Smith.

{"Headline": "Fed Held Rates Steady Over Concerns About Weak Growth Abroad", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFed officials signaled throughout much of the summer that they were getting ready to raise interest rates in the fall, after keeping their benchmark interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008. But the effect of a slowdown on American exports and commodity prices, combined with fewer signs of inflation, stayed their hand at their two-day meeting in mid-September.\u201cParticipants anticipated that recent global developments would likely put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term; compared with their previous forecasts, more now saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside,\u201d the summary said.\u201cIn part because of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information,\u201d the Fed said in the minutes.Analysts saw few surprises in the newly released report, but several disagreed on what it revealed about the likelihood that the Fed would raise its main rate before the end of the year.\u201cThey still think everything is on track,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cbut they want to make absolutely sure, given how poorly things are going overseas and how strong the dollar is.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up in afternoon trading, closing at 2,013.43. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond ticked lower after the minutes were released, but rebounded to close at 2.10.In a speech delivered a week after the committee meeting, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, maintained that the bank was still preparing to raise its benchmark rate later this year as long as the economy stayed on track.That assessment was reflected in the minutes: \u201cMost participants continued to anticipate that, based on their assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, the conditions for policy firming had been met or would likely be met by the end of the year.\u201dBut after the Labor Department reported last week that job growth in September was a disappointing 142,000 and that the labor force participation rate had fallen amid further stagnation in average hourly wages, many analysts scaled back their expectations for a Fed liftoff from the so-called zero bound.It turns out that reading the Fed minutes can be a \u201cRashomon\u201d-like exercise with analysts drawing widely varying conclusions from the same material.Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, said he noticed that a growing number of Fed officials expressed doubts about the risks of inflation. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have confidence they\u2019ll achieve their objectives, they will not change policy,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said. \u201cThe minutes make them sound like a group that isn\u2019t very confident.\u201dBut Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, also in Chicago, took away a different message from the summary. \u201cThe Fed is closer to liftoff than markets anticipate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get the sense that the meeting was more optimistic than their statement suggested.\u201dIn her view, the expectation among the Fed\u2019s staff that inflation might remain below the annual 2 percent pace the central bank considers healthy for spending and investment until 2018 does not mean the Fed will postpone its initial move much longer. But it does suggest, she said, that when the Fed does raise rates, it will go very slowly.Ms. Yellen has repeatedly said that when the Fed does act, it will move slowly, raising rates about one percentage point a year. But some analysts say they now think the Fed will be even more cautious.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.As the minutes made clear, Fed officials are paying attention to market expectations.\u201cThe last thing they want to do is surprise anybody,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to go in December, they\u2019ve got to get people ready for that.\u201dThat signaling may have already begun.In a speech in San Francisco on Tuesday, John C. Williams, president of the regional Federal Reserve Bank there and a voting member, said, \u201cThings are looking up, and if they stay on track, I see this as the year we start the process of monetary policy normalization.\u201dEric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, also said in an interview this week that a rate increase before the end of the year was likely. But he noted that the disappointing jobs report further sensitized him to the economy\u2019s fragility. \u201cIf we start getting a string of weak data,\u201d he said, \u201cthen obviously we don\u2019t need to be tightening if the economy is slowing down.\u201dGrowth of less than 2 percent or an increase in the unemployment rate could prompt him to endorse a delay, he said. (Mr. Rosengren is not currently a voting member, but he will be next year.)Fed officials remained cautiously optimistic about the impact that China\u2019s economic troubles, plunging oil prices and jittery stock markets could have on the American economy.\u201cMany participants judged that the effects of these developments on domestic economic activity were likely to be small,\u201d the Fed summary of the discussion said, \u201cbut they acknowledged the risk that they might restrain U.S. economic growth somewhat.\u201dThe minutes noted that participants were buoyed by the increases in consumer spending, improving housing activity and a strengthening labor market.But as long as inflation remains exceptionally low and the labor market is weaker than the 5.1 percent official unemployment rate would normally indicate, policy makers may be reluctant to pull the trigger.The committee next meets on Oct. 27 and 28, and then again on Dec. 15 and 16.Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Economy Really in Trouble? A Debate", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking StockI write about economics for a living. Part of my job is to look into the maw of economic data, financial market indicators, anecdotal reports from businesses and whatever else I can get my hands on, and turn it all into a crisp, clear narrative about the United States and global economies.But right now I\u2019m stuck. I have no idea how the United States economy is doing. And the closer I look at the data, the more contradictory it looks.There is also a strong case that the United States economy is robust enough to withstand whatever challenges might arise from overseas, and that the evidence of a slowdown is scattered and overstated. Fewer people have filed for unemployment insurance in recent weekly readings, for example, than any time since 1973.I\u2019ve tried several times in the last few weeks to convince myself that one of those stories is correct, but just can\u2019t decide between them. And because The New York Times is not fond of headlines that include the \u201cshruggie\u201d emoticon (for the uninitiated, that would be \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af), I have held off writing anything.Why am I telling you all this? Because sometimes the most accurate portrayal of a situation revolves around uncertainty \u2014 and because we journalists aren\u2019t always honest about that. This is my effort to be a little more honest.Rather than picking an analytical case and pretending to be more certain than I am, I want to walk readers through the conflicting evidence. Below, I do so in the form of the debate that has been playing out within my own head \u2014 and, very likely, around conference tables at every economic research group and central bank you can think of.It sure feels as if we\u2019re on the verge of something bad. The expansion is six years old, making it already the fourth-longest since World War II. If the economy does soften, the Federal Reserve is out of ammunition to do much of anything about it. This feels a little like late 2000, when there were signs the economy was losing momentum even though growth was still technically positive. Then in 2001 there was a mild recession.Whoa, not so fast. Back then there was a huge correction in the stock market and downturn in business investment that caused the recession. What are the sectors that you see correcting in 2015 or 2016 that put the economy at that much risk?Emerging markets, especially China? They\u2019ve had years of huge capital inflows, in no small part because of Fed policies, that papered over longer-term problems. Now the capital is flowing in the other direction, and the correction is looking to be vicious.Sure, but why would that cause anything more than modest ripples for the United States economy? Total exports to China were $124 billion last year, about 0.7 percent of United States G.D.P. And I know you\u2019re going to mention financial linkages, but it\u2019s not as if American banks are sitting on a ton of Chinese government debt. Even if things get worse in emerging markets, isn\u2019t this more like 1998, when an emerging markets crisis enveloped East Asia and Russia? As a reminder, the United States economy grew 4.7 percent in 1999, faster than in the preceding 15 years.Yeah, but there\u2019s no doubt that the financial markets, including in the United States, have been flashing warning signs since this summer.Sure, markets have been jumpy lately. But when you step back and take a bit of a long view, is it really anything to sweat about? The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was actually up very slightly for the year at Monday\u2019s close (up 0.6 percent, to be precise). Long-term Treasury bond rates have fallen a good bit since the summer but are still higher than they were back in the spring, meaning that the bond market isn\u2019t exactly panicking.Maybe Wall Street is just whining because after five years in which asset prices soared much more than the real economy, markets are taking a breather while the rest of the economy catches up?Maybe, but there are some cracks showing in the data on the real economy too. The last couple of jobs reports have been really bad! This month the data on retail sales and surveys of businesses have shown the same kind of softness. Maybe the economy is like Wile E. Coyote running off the cliff, and as soon as we look down we\u2019ll see it was all a mirage and fall.Come on, that\u2019s not how the economy works.For the economy to fall into recession, something has to cause it. A financial crisis that freezes up the credit system, tight monetary policy intended to fend off inflation, a collapse in the stock market, something. Recessions don\u2019t just happen for no particular reason.It\u2019s true that the economy is starting to feel an impact of the strong dollar (resulting in weaker exports) and cheaper oil (which means less oil and gas exploration). But we\u2019ve seen soft patches like this many times before. For example, job growth has been really weak the last couple of months, but it was about equally weak in June and July of 2013, and nobody even remembers that soft patch.And if you look at the broadest measures of the economy, there\u2019s not much sign of a downturn at all. For example, over the first nine months of 2015, United States gross domestic product rose at about a 2 percent annual rate, including a 1.5 percent third-quarter pace reported Thursday, broadly similar to the last several years. This could just be a case where people are freaked out by the market moves and are straining to discern a downshift in the economy that isn\u2019t really there.Yeah, but look at all the anxiety we\u2019re hearing this earnings season. Big, stalwart companies like Caterpillar and Walmart have downgraded their forecasts. Surely those are the canaries in the recessionary coal mine.There you go with the clich\u00e9s again. When you look a little more closely at some of these disappointing forecasts, what they\u2019re really telling us about the state of the economy is far more ambiguous.Take Caterpillar. Yes, it slashed its revenue forecast for 2015 and said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the next three years. But the major reason is the downturn in mining and energy exploration because of cheaper oil and other commodities. Obviously, it\u2019s too bad for those people who will lose their jobs, but the flip side is cheaper gasoline and other fuels for American consumers, which is an economic boost.We\u2019ve had years in which the problem in the economy has been companies that won\u2019t invest and workers who aren\u2019t getting pay raises. Walmart\u2019s earnings are suffering because of the opposite! That\u2019s good news for the economy, even if it\u2019s bad news for Walmart shareholders.O.K., Pollyanna, anything out there that does make you nervous?Oh, sure. The drop in stock prices and rise in borrowing costs for riskier companies means that capital is more expensive, and the dollar keeps strengthening on currency markets that will keep holding things back. And if I\u2019m wrong about any of this, the economy really does lack the shock absorbers right now that would help it: The Fed\u2019s most effective tools are pretty well spent, and there\u2019s no way a Republican Congress would even consider fiscal stimulus.So I get being nervous, but this doesn\u2019t feel like a moment when there are huge imbalances sitting out there due for a correction.I hope you\u2019re right. But if the 2008 crisis taught us anything, it\u2019s that trouble can spread in ways that are hard to predict, even if you think you know what\u2019s going on.Yeah, but what happened in 2008 was a once-a-century kind of storm. If you always think that the big one is imminent, most of the time you\u2019ll turn out to be wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Likely Debate Highlight: Democrats\u2019 Distance From Obama", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the seven years since Mr. Obama entered the White House on a wave of excitement, Democrats have developed a complicated relationship with their standard-bearer. And that is especially true for those running for their party\u2019s nomination.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders promise different approaches from Mr. Obama\u2019s, as much in style as in substance.A theme likely to dominate the debate, on CNN, is the problem of economic inequality and with it the implicit critique that although Mr. Obama pulled the economy out of the crisis that enveloped it in 2008, the recovery has left the vast majority of Americans behind. That sentiment has manifested itself on the campaign trail in a populist conviction reflected in the major candidates\u2019 positions on topics including trade agreements and Wall Street regulation.Mrs. Clinton reflects the party\u2019s tack to the left on domestic issues.That stood out as a break with the White House, which \u201cbasically took a pass when it came to prosecuting anyone from the financial crises,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Last week, Mr. Obama hosted a White House summit meeting on how to lift middle-class wages, and at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Saturday, he said one of the problems that had not been fully solved during his administration was \u201cthe fact that wages and incomes for ordinary Americans are still flat.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t gone as far in that space as what the candidates are proposing,\u201d Mr. Bernstein added, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone part of the way.\u201dJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a briefing last week that Mr. Obama \u201cunderstands that it is the responsibility of individual candidates to distinguish themselves.\u201d\u201cThat means distinguishing themselves from their competitors,\u201d Mr. Earnest continued. \u201cAnd in some cases, that means distinguishing themselves from the current occupant of the office.\u201dBut if the substance of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies will be indirectly debated on Tuesday, so will his style and the criticism that he has not tried hard enough to work with his political opponents.Without mentioning the president, Mrs. Clinton often promotes her ability to work with congressional Republicans, a theme she is likely to lean on heavily in the Tuesday debate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a pretty dysfunctional mess in Washington,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a recent rally in Columbus, Ohio.\u201cBut I worked across the aisle as a senator for eight years,\u201d she added. \u201cI worked with Republicans as secretary of state. I know there is no substitute for working hard every single day to find common ground.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had two presidents over a period of nearly 16 years who have failed on what was arguably the central promise of both their campaigns,\u201d Mr. Galston said, referring to Mr. Obama and George W. Bush. \u201cTo bring a divided country back together.\u201dStill, Mr. Obama is more broadly popular than Mr. Bush was in the fall of 2007, when the country began to take the measure of those who would succeed him.That makes too pointed a repudiation of Mr. Obama\u2019s leadership risky for the Democratic candidates. The president, whose approval rating nationally is roughly 47 percent, enjoys loyal support from key constituencies: African-Americans, who make up a central bloc in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support, and college-educated white liberals, an important group for Mr. Sanders.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.A.W. Contract Vote at Fiat Chrysler Takes a Populist Tone", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn many ways, the tentative contract negotiated by the U.A.W., under its president, Dennis Williams, had much to recommend it. It would have lifted the maximum pay of entry-level workers to over $25 an hour from around $19 an hour, and the pay of many veteran workers to around $30 an hour from around $28 \u2014 the first across-the-board raise in roughly a decade. It also gave every worker a ratification bonus of $3,000, and other bonuses worth thousands.But the membership worried that the company\u2019s commitments on health care were too vague, and that some domestic production might be moved to Mexico.Above all, rank-and-file workers complained that the union had abandoned a promise to rein in the so-called two-tier system, in which entry-level employees are consigned to a lower salary range with no hope of ascending to the higher pay scale.\u201cPeople feel like the leadership has insulted them,\u201d said Scott McGinnis, a worker at Chrysler\u2019s plant in Sterling Heights, Mich. \u201cConsidering the trust people feel has been broken, they really feel questionable about\u201d the possibility of improvements in future deals.Such was the level of suspicion toward the leadership that some workers uploaded photos of their ballots onto a handful of Facebook pages as evidence in the event the union failed to properly count them.Chrysler and the other two Detroit automakers have been consistently profitable in the last few years. In that context, members believed it was only fair to undo the most unsavory concessions they made when Chrysler lay on its deathbed around the time of the most recent recession.But while the union has some leverage \u2014 Chrysler in particular has so little redundancy in its production that a strike at a single plant could cripple its domestic operation \u2014 in a globalized economy the U.A.W. may simply not have the power to demand these changes.\u201cThere was an inability to manage expectations of the membership,\u201d Ms. Dziczek said, noting that one of the union\u2019s mottos dating back to Mr. Williams\u2019s election last year, \u201cIt\u2019s Our Time,\u201d may have unrealistically implied to members that they would be made nearly whole after years of concessions. (A U.A.W. spokesman declined to comment.)Increasingly, the frustrations that result from this disparity between expectations and actual power appears to affect almost every institution set up to provide workers with a measure of economic justice, from labor unions to the government\u2019s fiscal policy apparatus.\u201cThe old 20th-century income distribution system has broken down,\u201d said Guy Standing, a professor of development studies at the University of London, whose book \u201cThe Precariat\u201d traces the implications of a growing mass of economically insecure workers.Professor Standing noted that while offshoring and outsourcing labor had been undermining workers\u2019 leverage for decades, those forces had in recent years begun to affect a majority of workers, who now experience declining or stagnating real wages. (The book\u2019s title combines \u201cprecarious\u201d with \u201cproletariat.\u201d)\u201cYou\u2019re getting a huge growth of the precariat, and more people feeling they could join it at any stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they look to the old institutions, they don\u2019t actually feel that these institutions are relevant for their particular way of life.\u201dBeyond that, she said, they have \u201ca generalized feeling that the country is being lost,\u201d which helps explain the Trump phenomenon as well. (Professor Skocpol stipulated that the left- and right-wing versions of these populist revolts are not entirely analogous: the right-wing version, she said, has an element of cultural and racial grievance that is unconnected to economics.)Mr. Boehner\u2019s aides repeatedly tried to explain that the desire of the Tea Partiers and their congressional representatives to thwart what they saw as the president\u2019s redistributionist policies far exceeded the House Republican leadership\u2019s ability to deliver it. But the Tea Partiers refused to dial back their ambitions.\u201cHis problem was he was speaking about what was realistic,\u201d said former Representative Steven C. LaTourette, a Boehner ally and fellow Ohio Republican. \u201cThese guys wanted to go home and say they shut down the government over Obamacare and have the crowd go wild.\u201dMr. Boehner was haunted by the promises he made to appease his members \u2014 for example, an insistence that he would not raise tax rates \u2014 whenever it came time to close a deal with the president.Similarly, many autoworkers were irate that the union leadership had indicated in a summary document it distributed tied to its 2011 negotiations with Fiat Chrysler that the company would cap entry-level employees at 25 percent in 2015, only to claim in recent weeks that the promise was, in effect, a misstatement.\u201cIf this was in fact something that was not in the 2011 contract, why do so many people have the paperwork?\u201d asked Mr. McGinnis, the Chrysler worker. \u201cBut nobody conveniently knows about it.\u201dStill, in the end, the problem may have been less about any particular aspect of the negotiations than a distrust of any process that involves one side sitting across a table from the other and horse-trading at a time when anxious workers are seeking major improvements in their standards of living.\u201cA lot of victories won\u2019t be achieved at the bargaining table, they\u2019ll be achieved on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not till you flip over the table.

Mr. Koh will announce the effort, which is called CityScore, on Thursday night during a talk at TEDxCambridge, a speaking event here.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for the mayor to say, in a given day, how well are we doing to meet our targets, or how much improvement do we need to meet our targets?\u201d Mr. Koh said.The effort, which experts say is among the first \u2014 if not the first \u2014 of its kind, seems a natural and brainy ambition for a city that prides itself on its growing innovation economy and its proximity to some of the nation\u2019s top universities.\u201cThis actionable overview of city metrics will help us improve city services and make our city safer and smarter,\u201d Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement.But there are questions on how useful a single number can be to city government \u2014 an enterprise that is extremely complex \u2014 and on how vastly different metrics, like library visits and fire department responses, will be weighted within the same algorithm.The initiative comes as many cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Houston, make data and analytics a hallmark of 21st-century governance.\u201cIt\u2019s building on two developments in big-city government in the U.S.,\u201d said Anthony Townsend, the author of \u201cSmart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for A New Utopia.\u201d\u201cThe first is increased data collection within some agencies,\u201d he said, \u201cand an increased emphasis on performance-based management by mayors.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in Boston, I think,\u201d Dr. Goldsmith said, \u201cis that all of those things are coming together.\u201dMr. Walsh has tried to emphasize data-driven governance: He and some of his cabinet members have personalized dashboards showing crucial metrics in their offices, which was inspired by a visit Mr. Walsh took to the office of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.CityScore, Mr. Koh said, will try to take all that data and turn it into a useful statistic, though not one that is intended to supplant the mayor\u2019s visits to neighborhoods or his conversations with residents. Appropriate for a sports-crazed city, the effort was inspired by baseball.\u201cIt literally started with the conversation around the government batting average,\u201d Mr. Koh said.The score will be available to the public, as will the formulas that go into it, and other cities will be encouraged to use them.The analysts have created scores for things like energy consumption and crime, based on whether city targets are being met or their numbers change over time, and they will roll those into a final score. It is not terribly complicated; the formula, said one city analyst, Stefanie Costa Leabo, \u201cdoesn\u2019t go much beyond averages and standard deviations.\u201dThey have not yet decided how to weight metrics against one another. Crime and public safety, the analysts said, will probably receive a higher weight. \u201cWe need to figure out the best way to weight these things, and there will be some that will be somewhat political,\u201d Mr. Koh said, adding that those decisions could change later.But Dr. Townsend, the author of \u201cSmart Cities,\u201d wondered how useful the final score would be. \u201cIt seems to me like an unnecessary oversimplification,\u201d he said.Mr. Koh said CityScore would be a useful way for a busy mayor leading a complicated city to gauge success or failure. \u201cIf we have the tools to better measure our performance,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s our fiduciary duty to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treasury Considers Plan to Help Puerto Rico ", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials in the Treasury Department are discussing a radical and aggressive response to the fiscal chaos engulfing Puerto Rico that could involve a broad debt exchange assisted by the federal government.The proposal calls for the federal government to help Puerto Rico collect and account for local tax revenues from the island\u2019s businesses and residents, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the proposal. An inability to collect all the taxes owed is widely seen as contributing to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis.The tax proceeds would be placed in a \u201clockbox\u201d overseen by the Treasury and eventually paid out by the Treasury to the holders of the new bonds that Puerto Rico would issue in the proposed exchange. Since the Treasury would effectively become the paying agent for the new bonds, they would be more attractive than the bonds that creditors now hold. That would make it easier for Puerto Rico to exchange the new debt with creditors who hold bonds that have been devastated in value since the island warned this summer that it could not pay its debts.The proposal has logistical, political and legal challenges, however, and may never get off the ground.\u201cRight now, Puerto Ricans don\u2019t even like to pay taxes to their own government,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the discussions. If the I.R.S. were to suddenly replace the local tax authorities and try to gather up the money for debt service, \u201cpeople would say, \u2018Go to hell. I\u2019m not paying the U.S. government.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBut the fact that such an unusual idea has been floated between the Treasury and top finance officials from Puerto Rico in recent months suggests a sharp shift in Washington\u2019s approach to the island\u2019s economic crisis.Without addressing the proposal directly, officials from the Treasury said in a statement that it had \u201cno plans to provide a bailout to Puerto Rico.\u201dUntil now, the Treasury has provided mostly technical assistance to island officials, while the Republican leaders in Congress have expressed strong reservations about bailing out Puerto Rico. The island\u2019s first choice appears to be a bankruptcy law amendment that would allow the island to send some of its governmental bodies into Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy court. But bills introduced to that effect have not moved.The current proposal, which has been called a \u201cglobal exchange vehicle\u201d by some, and \u201csuperbond\u201d by others, appears to have been developed as a backup plan, in case the Republican lawmakers do not change their minds. The idea would not involve the federal government issuing debt, or even guaranteeing debt, on Puerto Rico\u2019s behalf.Rather, Treasury would help safeguard Puerto Rico\u2019s tax proceeds to reassure creditors that they would not be used for any purposes other than to pay off debt. That safeguard, in theory, should lower the default risk and allow Puerto Rico to borrow at lower interest rates.For the last year, Puerto Rico has been virtually shut out of the debt markets because potential investors see the island as highly risky and expect to be compensated for bearing that risk with exceptionally high interest rates.Puerto Rican officials have been warning that the island is likely to exhaust its cash in November, and a debt payment of almost $300 million is due on Dec. 1. They have also been saying they would soon lay out their initial proposal for a debt exchange, but so far a large number of creditors \u2014 particularly those with bad memories of Detroit\u2019s grueling bankruptcy case \u2014 have declined to sign the mandatory confidentiality agreements.\u201cYeah, we heard the \u2018superbond\u2019 piece, we heard that Treasury might be involved, but we have this fundamental issue,\u201d said the person with knowledge of the discussions. \u201cIs this a real deal, or is it just designed to fail?\u201dThat person believed that a deal of this type would raise complex legal questions about whether Treasury\u2019s involvement changed the priority of the creditors. Those that felt they had lost their places at the front of the line might sue, and their lawsuits might prompt others to pile on. A hornets\u2019 nest of litigation might ultimately even persuade the Republicans in Congress to give Puerto Rico the amended bankruptcy law that it wants, that person said, adding, \u201cWe know they want to do a grand and sweeping deal, and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re negotiating in good faith or they\u2019re just setting us up.\u201dThe mayors who dominate the tax body\u2019s governing board say the bank\u2019s cash-flow records are opaque and they do not know what will happen to the money if the bank gets it. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, told Puerto Rican officials in a recent hearing that it would be hard to give them federal assistance unless they opened their financial records to scrutiny.Creditors\u2019 concerns about inadequate tax collection and fiscal transparency have been a focal point in their early talks with Puerto Rico\u2019s investment bankers about a possible debt exchange, said one person briefed on the discussions.The logistics of sending federal tax collectors or contractors to Puerto Rico would be difficult. The idea also presents legal problems. Holders of the island\u2019s general-obligation bonds, for example, currently have an explicit constitutional promise of having the first claim on \u201cavailable resources\u201d to pay their bonds. They would most likely challenge any move that would lay claim to tax revenues and send them somewhere else, such as the United States Treasury.Holders of lower-priority bonds might like the idea of a federal role, however. The idea of a state-led revenue \u201cintercept\u201d is not uncommon in cases where severely distressed cities or school districts have shown signs of defaulting on their bonds. In Puerto Rico\u2019s case, the Treasury would be stepping into the role that is normally played by the state.It is unclear whether a Treasury-assisted debt exchange would apply to all of the island\u2019s $72 billion debt. The lockbox could be used to assure payment of just a portion of the new bonds, for example, as a way of helping reluctant creditors to the table as part of a broader exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crimes Without Punishment?", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past six months, the neighborhood, where the crime rate is surging, has become a case study in the conflict between those calling for more lenient policies toward criminals and those who see arrest, prosecution and jail as the most effective deterrents of crime.The blacks incarcerated in this country are not like the majority of Americans. They do not merely hail from poor communities \u2014 they hail from communities that have been imperiled across both the deep and immediate past, and continue to be imperiled today. Peril is generational for black people in America \u2014 and incarceration is our current mechanism for ensuring that the peril continues. Incarceration pushes you out of the job market. Incarceration disqualifies you from feeding your family with food stamps. Incarceration allows for housing discrimination based on a criminal-background check. Incarceration increases your risk of homelessness. Incarceration increases your chances of being incarcerated again.are not the solution for every type of offender. And in some instances, they have the unintended consequence of hardening nonviolent, low-risk offenders \u2014 making them a greater risk to the public than when they entered.That may be what\u2019s happening on the national level but locally, it gets complicated, especially in more liberal neighborhoods.The results of the spike in crime are reverberating across the Capitol Hill neighborhood. On the local listserv, newhilleast \u2013 an email network of residents who live within a few blocks of the United States Capitol \u2014 a single subject line crops up repeatedly: \u201cDC\u2019s Reign Of Terror.\u201dThe escalation in crime has revealed a split within the generally progressive community of Capitol Hill.In the Oct. 1 issue of the Hill, a newspaper covering Congress and the surrounding area, Krepp wrote:Every morning, neighbors greet each other as they walk their dogs or walk to the metro to get to work. Our small-town life was horribly disrupted when an elderly neighbor was hit by an individual a third of his age. It was 8 a.m., the sun was shining, and out of the blue he was clocked in the face. The police call this type of assault a \u201csimple assault.\u201d My neighbor sustained dark black bruises but no stitches were required.In the interview, Krepp described her view of how laws should be enforced: \u201cIf you hit one of my residents, you are going to jail. You don\u2019t get a free swing at someone.\u201dOn the other side are those who believe that it is more important to address the social, racial and economic factors behind crime.\u201cI actually think we should care why these individuals are committing these crimes. If we don\u2019t know why then how will we prevent it? In other words, we need to understand the cause not just focus on the symptom,\u201d Ned Malone wrote on newhilleast.Sarah A. Spurgeon posted a comment there that reflects the complexity of the issue of crime for many Hill residents:These mostly juvenile offenders are engaging in violent crime because they can without any serious repercussions, plain and simple. While I agree we need to address deep rooted social issues, like economic inequality and institutional racism, that may be the fundamental source of these crimes, the more immediate reason they are engaging in violent crime is because the deterrent is so low. So yes, while we need to continue to invest in addressing social problems \u2014 and it should be noted that DC has many, many services and social programs that can be taken advantage of \u2014 there are more expedient and effective measures for this recent surge in violent crime. Our political leaders must have the courage to increase the immediate and sustained penalties for juveniles and others who engage in violent, criminal behavior. No, we cannot arrest our way out of this problem, but we can ensure there are meaningful consequences for those who are arrested. Currently, it appears that those who rob by force (i.e., via assault or with a gun) are released to their guardians and are never prosecuted.Richard Lukas, another resident, takes a more aggressive posture on the listserv: \u201cWe are being terrorized by a small percentage of \u2018irrational actors\u2019.\u201dWhat can be done? \u201cNothing.\u201d Public officials, Lukas argues,are loathe to address publicly what we all know privately: There is a very active segment of marauding at-risk youths who find satisfaction from terrorizing people on a daily basis.One of the more outspoken contributors to newhilleast is Margaret Holwill, a 40-year Hill resident who is angered by the fact that teenagers\u2019 records are secret. She writes on the listserv that juvenile \u201crecords would certainly have affected the court being able to hold defendants pending trial. It would absolutely make a difference in any possible plea bargains. And sentences. It would get cold-blooded criminals off our streets.\u201dOn the listserv, she voiced her disagreement with Ta-Nehisi Coates:Oh, please. Ta-Nehisi Coates fixates on mass incarceration for which he blames the system but ignores the community members who simply walked away from responsibility for the children they sired or family members they could have influenced.The penalty for misdemeanors is most often probation.In the 11 months since the passage of Prop 47, more than 4,300 state prisoners have been resentenced and then released. Drug arrests in Los Angeles County have dropped by a third. Jail bookings are down by a quarter. Hundreds of thousands of ex-felons have applied to get their previous drug convictions revised or erased.Over the same period, however,along with the successes have come other consequences, which police departments and prosecutors refer to as the \u201cunintended effects\u201d: Robberies up 23 percent in San Francisco. Property theft up 11 percent in Los Angeles. Certain categories of crime rising 20 percent in Lake Tahoe, 36 percent in La Mirada, 22 percent in Chico and 68 percent in Desert Hot Springs.\u201cIt\u2019s a slap on the wrist the first time and the third time and the 30th time, so it\u2019s a virtual get-out-of-jail-free card,\u201d Shelley Zimmerman, San Diego\u2019s police chief, told Saslow. \u201cWe\u2019re catching and releasing the same people over and over.\u201dRepeat offenders are now known among the police as \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d One shoplifter was caught while using a calculator to make sure his take did not break the $950 cutoff, Saslow reported.Looking at the costs, benefits and unintended consequences of both hard-line and lenient policies, the question becomes: is there an effective and fair-minded approach to arrest, prosecution and imprisonment policy which would elicit consensus from the voting population?The answer is probably no. Law enforcement is where the much broader failures of the system end up \u2014 their failure a result of a vicious combination: the loss of low-skill jobs; neighborhoods of concentrated poverty; the psychic damage inflicted by that poverty; and the long history of racial discrimination. The police, jails and courts are not equipped to address these failures, only to manage them. The institutions designed to maintain public safety will inevitably falter as long as the social order itself malfunctions, and as long as voters are sharply divided on these intensely felt issues. It\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to resolve these matters, either in the neighborhood itself or in the building that gives Capitol Hill its name.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesian Fires Spread an Ill Wind", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSINGAPORE \u2014 I just returned home after a three-week trip to America to learn that the supermarket chains here no longer sell my favorite brand of four-ply toilet paper. The reason? Its producer \u2014 Asia Pulp and Paper \u2014 is one of five companies being investigated by Singaporean authorities in connection with forest fires in Indonesia that have left parts of Southeast Asia blanketed in a choking, dangerous haze for weeks.For the first time, Singapore is applying pressure to businesses that could be responsible for making its air almost unbreathable. But banning a brand of toilet paper and other paper products is not likely to curb the Indonesian fires, which have happened every fall for decades at great cost not only to the regional economies, but also to the global environment. Countries affected by the smoke are unhappy with the lack of action \u2014 despite the agreement to reduce haze pollution by addressing land and forest fires signed by all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Indonesia was the last to ratify it last year. Singapore and Indonesia are friendly neighbors, but the much larger Indonesia tends to view Singapore as a younger brother. A former Indonesian president called our city-state of 5.3 million people \u201ca little red dot\u201d years ago. Recent comments by Indonesian leaders, including Vice President Jusuf Kalla, about how Singapore should be grateful for fresh air during the 11 months when there is no haze, reflect their cavalier, almost derisive, attitude toward their tiny first-world neighbor. Singaporeans are angry at Indonesia, but many are even more determined to ensure that Singapore remains successful.As the haze swept across the region, schools were closed, sporting events canceled and flights disrupted. Over 300,000 people have suffered respiratory diseases and other ailments. Animals were affected too, with veterinarians reporting more cases of sick pets; hundreds of Indonesia\u2019s endangered orangutans were threatened as well. Friends told me I was especially fortunate to be away at the end of September, when the haze was at its worst and poor air quality prompted fast-food chains to stop food deliveries. Singapore\u2019s Pollutant Standards Index reached a record high of 322 on Sept. 25. Any P.S.I. reading from 201 to 300 is considered unhealthy and a reading over 300 is hazardous.My wife tried to make light of the situation by sending me a photo of our Persian cat wearing a pollution mask, which most Singaporeans use regularly. \u201cI also just bought another air purifier,\u201d she messaged me. That\u2019s our second air purifier. The first was bought in 2013, the last time the haze was this bad.Scientists have warned that Indonesia\u2019s forest fires this year are among the worst on record, because of a prolonged dry season linked to El Ni\u00f1o. The smoky pollution is not expected to dissipate until the end of the year or early 2016. For decades, farmers, palm oil plantations and locals have been illegally clearing cropland by burning because it is far cheaper than doing it with machines. While the Indonesian police recently identified seven companies and 133 individuals suspected of starting the fires, there are few prosecutions because of conflicting rules, corruption and a lack of political will.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, has visited the worst-affected areas, deployed thousands of soldiers and accepted help from foreign countries to fight the fires. He says he needs three years to solve the problem, which some analysts believe is too ambitious given its scale.\u201cThe issues and interests behind the fires are complex and will not be resolved just by the word of one person, even the president,\u201d Simon Tay, a law professor and chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, wrote recently, citing how powerful corporations are involved and politicians have often played down the problem. A \u201cJakarta-only\u201d mind-set persists, and the fires and haze do not affect the capital, some 850 kilometers southeast of Singapore, where the rich and political elite live, he added.Last month, Singapore\u2019s foreign minister at the time, K. Shanmugam, accused Indonesia of showing \u201ccomplete disregard for our people, and their own.\u201dIndeed, those most affected are the poor villagers living near the hot spots in the provinces of Sumatra and Kalimantan, where P.S.I. readings commonly soar above 1,000. It is hard to imagine what the air was like in Central Kalimantan when the P.S.I. hit a record high of 2,300 in late September. Yet many residents there went about their daily routine without masks.In the long term, the Indonesian government has to come up with a plan to prevent forest fires and the damage they do to the environment. It already has the world\u2019s highest rate of deforestation, losing over 6 million hectares of forest between 2000 and 2012, according to a study by the University of Maryland. Not surprisingly, Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest emitters of climate-changing greenhouse gases.And the impact on warming could get worse. Over 100,000 hectares of peat-land forests are cleared each year. The peat-lands \u2014 essentially dead plants that have remained wet under swampy conditions \u2014 are an important carbon sink. When burned, large quantities of stored carbon are released into the atmosphere. Greenpeace has called the situation \u201cIndonesia\u2019s carbon bomb\u201d and estimates that the fires will emit more carbon this year than the entire United Kingdom.This activity worsens global warming, which in turn makes forest fires more prevalent, thus feeding a vicious cycle. At some point, even the powerful Indonesians who now enjoy the relatively haze-free air in Jakarta will have to pay a price for their inaction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Terrible September Jobs Report Means for the Economy", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThe weak numbers offer some vindication for those Federal Reserve officials who preferred to hold off on interest rate increases last month to ensure the economy was on sound footing before tightening the money supply. They also give reason to worry that those wild market swings in August were less random fluctuations and more an indication that something deeper is wrong with the global economy \u2014 not so much that the stock market drop in August caused weak September jobs numbers, but that there is an underlying economic fragility causing both.The question now is whether it means anything \u2014 whether the United States economic expansion, which seemed set to roar into 2015, is slowing in some meaningful way. We don\u2019t know that yet, and it would be a mistake to leap to that conclusion. But that possibility became quite a bit more plausible after the September numbers popped onto economists\u2019 computer screens.As always, it is a useful exercise on jobs report Fridays to take a deep breath and remember that this is but one set of indicators, with a large margin of statistical error, that will be revised repeatedly. But the fact that the latest jobs numbers are consistent with another report, from the Institute of Supply Management, earlier this week that suggested United States manufacturing slowed to a standstill in September doesn\u2019t do anything to help an economy-watcher maintain that zen perspective.The new numbers are poor on pretty much every level. American employers added a mere 142,000 jobs last month, far below the analyst forecast of 201,000 or the average over the last year of 229,000. Revisions pushed July and August numbers down substantially. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1 percent.This is usually the point in one of these stories where we would list the silver linings \u2014 the countervailing details that suggest it isn\u2019t as bad as all that. This report doesn\u2019t really offer any. Average weekly hours fell. Average hourly pay was unchanged. The number of people in the labor force fell by 350,000, and the number of people who reported having a job fell by 236,000.We don\u2019t even have a major snowstorm or other weird weather event to blame, nor a strike in a major industry, nor some outsize shift in the results from one category of employer that might suggest an aberration.That said, that theory doesn\u2019t match up with the stagnant hourly pay and data in the survey of households suggesting people may be leaving the work force.The best silver lining is probably not anything specific to be found in the details of the September report, nor in the economic moment we\u2019re in. The best silver lining is that this is a data series with a lot of statistical variance that can send false signals, even for a few months in a row, that don\u2019t ultimately mean anything. In February 2014, for example, the three-month average job growth fell below where it is now (154,000 then, 167,000 now), and that was hardly a sign of a recession, though that did coincide with some nasty weather patterns.So we might turn out to be in one of those periods when the data falter for no particular reason. If so, it would be an unfortunate coincidence that it\u2019s coming when so much else about the world economy is looking perilous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Joko Widodo of Indonesia Joins Trans-Pacific Partnership", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama won a crucial ally in his push for a sweeping Pacific Rim trade agreement on Monday when President Joko Widodo of Indonesia said during a White House visit that his country planned to join the pact, an important element of Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy agenda.Mr. Joko\u2019s decision to eventually join the Trans-Pacific Partnership bolsters the agreement, which was reached this month by the United States and 11 other nations and must be ratified by each member. The pact, part of Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy to balance China\u2019s economic ascent, would knit together a largest-of-its-kind trading system in the Pacific.Indonesia has an economy worth $1 trillion, and it is a member of the Group of 20 major economies.\u201cIndonesia is an open economy, and with the 250 million population, we are the largest economy in Southeast Asia,\u201d Mr. Joko told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, sitting beside Mr. Obama after the two finished a private meeting. \u201cIndonesia intends to join the T.P.P.\u201dMr. Obama, whose stepfather was Indonesian and who spent time in the country as a child, became the first president to welcome an Indonesian leader to the White House in a decade. He greeted Mr. Joko warmly, speaking a few words in his language and reflecting on his connection to the country. Mr. Obama pledged American assistance to help Indonesia deal with raging forest and peat fires that are choking Southeast Asia with haze.\u201cI have a very personal interest in Indonesia given the fact that I spent time there as a child and have relatives who are Indonesian,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI complimented the president on a number of the reforms that he\u2019s initiated, and we discussed how we could continue to strengthen the trade, investment and commercial relationships between our two countries.\u201dThe leaders talked about \u201cwhy it\u2019s so important that large countries like ours work together to arrive at the strongest possible set of targets and international agreements when we arrive in Paris just a little over a month from now,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to a United Nations summit meeting where every country is expected to commit to emissions reduction targets.\u201cWhether it\u2019s helping Indonesia deal with the current difficulties surrounding peat fires, or it is encouraging ongoing student exchanges between our two countries, this meeting signifies our taking this partnership to the next level,\u201d he said.The Indonesian president also said he wanted to work with Mr. Obama on climate change \u201cfor the sake of our future generations.\u201d But he acknowledged the difficulties posed by the fires ripping through his country, which prompted Mr. Joko to cut short his American visit and schedule his return to Indonesia on Wednesday. He had planned to travel to San Francisco and tour Silicon Valley, visiting the headquarters of Google and having dinner with Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple.But Mr. Joko did highlight his desire to reform Indonesia\u2019s economy and attract foreign investment, particularly infrastructure development. After meeting privately with Mr. Obama, Mr. Joko made his way across the street to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, where he met with executives and administration officials to complete about $20 billion in business deals, including several in the energy sector.The deals included $13 billion in shale gas sales and purchase agreements with the Indonesian firm Pertamina and Corpus Christi Liquefaction, a subsidiary of the American firm Cheniere Energy, as well as a five-year investment, worth up to $1 billion, by General Electric in power, oil and gas, and health care projects, Indonesian officials said.The White House announced new initiatives to help Indonesia promote clean energy technologies, widen access to energy and reduce energy-sector greenhouse-gas emissions.The two presidents also committed to working together in the fight against the Islamic State and other extremist elements, a challenge that Mr. Obama said Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Muslim country \u2014 was well-suited to tackle.\u201cIndonesia, I think, is uniquely positioned to be able to help spread a message of peace and cooperation and modernity within the Muslim world,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Joko said Islam in Indonesia \u201cis moderate, modern and tolerant.\u201d\u201cIndonesia is damaging its reputation as a tolerant Muslim society by weakening protections for women and religious minorities,\u201d said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boys and Girls, Constrained by Toys and Costumes", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRole PlayingA web search for Halloween costumes of scientists produces only boys wearing lab coats and goggles. A search for nursing costumes turns up girls in skirts with stethoscopes. Cats and cupcakes are also girls, while sharks and astronauts are boys.The same gender division exists not just in toys \u2014 blue toolboxes and trucks for boys, pink play kitchens and dolls for girls \u2014 but also in nearly every other children\u2019s product, including baby blankets, diapers and toothbrushes.These distinctions have long-term effects on children\u2019s notions of gender roles, social scientists say. Costumes, toys and many other environmental cues can influence the subjects children choose to study, the jobs they pursue and the roles they play at home and in society.Yet as men and women have become more equal in American society, with more women working and more men involved at home, marketing to boys and girls has become more pronounced.Until the 1960s, girls\u2019 toys focused on homemaking and boys\u2019 on work in the industrial economy, she found. That changed significantly with the rise of the feminist movement of the 1970s. But in the 1990s, gendered toys returned with a vengeance, resulting in the action heroes and princesses available today.Today, parents put pink headbands on bald infant girls and give boys blue pacifiers to clearly delineate gender from Day 1. Gender-neutral toys or clothes are rare.Boys\u2019 toys and costumes tend to be associated with action or destruction: objects that move, characters that save the day and animals that prey. Girls\u2019 toys and costumes are more passive: objects to be looked at, characters that are rescued and animals that are docile or pretty.Seventeen percent of the toys appeared on both the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 lists \u2014 though they almost all resembled boys\u2019 toys. Among the gender-neutral toys, blue was the most common color, and stuffed animals were the most common type.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of very positive costumes for little boys that stress that you can get adventure, you can accomplish great things and have the right to,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. \u201cThe equivalent costumes for girls still suggest if you\u2019re going to accomplish great things, it\u2019s going to be in relation to how well you look.\u201dHer study was published in 2000, and a recent update, not yet published, found that young girls\u2019 costumes, whether for heroes or villains, have become more sexualized \u2014 for example, dresses with bustiers.At Spirit Halloween in SoHo this week, Bella Aulie-Sand, 3, tried on a ninja turtle mask and chose a Rapunzel wig. Olivia Copeland, 8, wanted a Captain America costume and ended up with one with a skirt.\u201cThe way society is today, we make a very fine definition of what\u2019s for girls and what\u2019s for boys,\u201d said Hattie Burns, Olivia\u2019s mother. \u201cI wish girls had more kid-friendly costumes that aren\u2019t tightly fitted or sexist.\u201dLynn Liben of Penn State University and Lacey Hilliard of Tufts University studied preschool students. In some of the classrooms, teachers made no distinctions between boys and girls. In others, teachers differentiated between them, such as asking them to line up separately.After two weeks, the children in the group where distinctions were made were much more likely to hold stereotypical beliefs about whether men and women should be in traditionally male or female occupations, and spent much less time playing with peers of the opposite sex. Even saying \u201cboys and girls\u201d instead of \u201cchildren\u201d had the effect.Still, gender-neutral tends to mean that girls can do what boys do. On Halloween, there will probably be more girls as Captain America than boys as Elsa the Disney princess, just as more women become business executives than men become preschool teachers.\u201cGirls and women are much more likely to feel comfortable transgressing gender boundaries,\u201d Ms. Auster said. \u201cIn our society, we\u2019ve placed much more value on that which is masculine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Literary critics praised it. Feminists condemned its depiction of women (supine, in all senses of the word, including in not standing up to the imposition of Shariah law). The right called it prescient. The left called it a gift to the right-wing National Front. Prime Minister Manuel Valls denounced it, saying: \u201cFrance isn\u2019t Michel Houellebecq. It isn\u2019t intolerance, hate, fear.\u201d In August, France\u2019s establishment dailies, Le Figaro and Le Monde, published five- and six-part series on him.Such intense attention is probably not likely in the United States, where literary fiction and talk-radio politics rarely overlap, and where the blows of terrorism \u2014 the Sept. 11 attacks, the beheadings of Americans in the Middle East by the Islamic State \u2014 are not as fresh as the Charlie Hebdo massacre, nor as close to home.Asked what posed the greatest threat in France today, radical Islam, Islamophobia or anti-Semitism, all of which are thriving, Mr. Houellebecq said, \u201cIt depends for whom.\u201d\u201cAnti-Semitism is a derivation of Islamic radicalism,\u201d he said, and it\u2019s mostly the Islamic radicals who are on the attack. \u201cIslamophobia is a defensive reaction, one of fear, which is justified.\u201dIn \u201cSubmission,\u201d the head of a fictional Muslim Brotherhood party allies with the Socialists to defeat the National Front, led in the novel \u2014 as in reality \u2014 by Marine Le Pen. Crime drops, the economy improves, Shariah law arrives, polygamy becomes legal, and women have to wear the veil and are encouraged to stay home and make babies. The protagonist\u2019s Jewish girlfriend emigrates to Israel.\u201cIslam is easier,\u201d Mr. Houellebecq said in the interview. \u201cLooking at a church, a Romanesque church in particular, and looking attentively at the statues, we don\u2019t understand. We don\u2019t understand what the nature of this faith was. It\u2019s very exotic. It seems more exotic to us than Islam.\u201d As the novel ends, Fran\u00e7ois is poised to convert to Islam, although Mr. Houellebecq said he had left ambiguous whether he does.\u201cSubmission\u201d seems to ask whether Islam is compatible with France\u2019s republican values. Does Mr. Houellebecq think that it is? \u201cCatholicism isn\u2019t compatible with France\u2019s republican values,\u201d he said. \u201cCatholicism lost against the republican idea of France.\u201d Today, he said, Islam has more of a chance to take hold in society.And he doesn\u2019t distinguish between political Islam and Islam in general. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference,\u201d he said. \u201cIslam is political because it describes the way in which society should be organized.\u201dPut bluntly, the women in his novels are in bed \u2014 and then they die. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Houellebecq said, pausing slightly for comic effect, \u201clike all of us.\u201d Was this his view of women, or that of his characters? \u201cIt\u2019s the way my characters see women,\u201d said Mr. Houellebecq, who is twice divorced. \u201cI don\u2019t get too involved.\u201dThen he glided into provocation. \u201cProstitution is a good idea,\u201d he said. For whom? \u201cEveryone.\u201d But isn\u2019t it a form of exploitation of women? \u201cAll work is exploitation,\u201d he answered. Isn\u2019t that a bit too easy? \u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. So does he himself frequent prostitutes? \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Surely the police escort must complicate things? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. Prostitution, he added, \u201cis one of the foundations of Western civilization \u2014 it\u2019s a corrective to monogamy.\u201dWith the ever-present threat of terrorism, Mr. Houellebecq said he had never lived through a more troubling moment in France. \u201cThe situation is getting worse,\u201d he said.He didn\u2019t seem too concerned. It was a lovely Paris evening. Two plainclothes officers walked him from the publishers\u2019 office onto the street. He slung a backpack over one shoulder. Is he working on another novel? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d All afternoon, he had played the role of Michel Houellebecq to perfection.Advertisement"}

With share prices sagging, even many of the top-performing mutual funds couldn\u2019t eke out gains. They just lost less than most of their peers.The fund is part of Vanguard\u2019s LifeStrategy family \u2014 four indexed funds with fixed allocations to stocks and bonds. They differ only in the proportions of these allocations. They are what is known as \u201cfunds of funds\u201d: they don\u2019t buy stocks and bonds directly but rather hold shares in four other Vanguard index funds: its Total Stock Market index fund, Total International stock index fund, Total Bond Market II index fund and Total International bond index fund.\u201cLifeStrategy Income is one of our single-fund solutions,\u201d said Francis M. Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group. \u201cWith it, you in effect own the entire global equity market \u2014 more than 5,000 U.S. stocks and more than 5,000 non-U.S. stocks. On the fixed income side, you have more than 5,000 U.S. bonds and more than 5,000 non-U.S. bonds. It\u2019s world-class diversification.\u201dOver the last several years, as the costs of international investing have fallen, Vanguard has raised the LifeStrategy funds\u2019 international stakes. Today, about 24 percent of the income fund\u2019s total assets are invested in foreign bonds and about 8 percent in foreign stocks. Vanguard responded to research showing that too many investors have a home bias \u2014 they invest too much of their money in their home country and end up with insufficient diversification, Mr. Kinniry said.\u201cOur rationale was accessibility and affordability,\u201d he said. Vanguard\u2019s commitment to low expenses keeps the fund cheap: Its expense ratio is 0.14 percent, compared with 0.74 percent for its average peer, according to Morningstar\u2019s data.Mr. Davidowitz and the other co-manager, Damon A. Ficklin, hunt for stocks with steadily growing earnings. But unlike many growth-stock managers, they are not primarily seeking new breakthroughs in biotechnology or online commerce. They aim for proven, durable growers. Thus their portfolio is filled with familiar names like Apple, Nike, Starbucks and Nestl\u00e9. \u201cOur margin of safety is the permanence of a company\u2019s franchise and our estimate of the longevity of its growth,\u201d Mr. Davidowitz said.Take Nestl\u00e9. \u201cIt may be a boring company, but year in and year out, it compounds its earnings growth\u201d and has been doing so for decades, he said. \u201cIf you invest in companies like that, you can ride alongside their earnings growth.\u201dStarbucks is another example of a seemingly mature company that has continued to yield good returns. The managers bought in about five years ago and have watched the stock mostly climb since.\u201cStarbucks overplayed back in the 2000s when they focused almost exclusively on growing their number of stores,\u201d Mr. Ficklin said. After shuttering several hundred underperforming outlets, the chain has aimed to increase same-store sales and find new goods to sell besides its many coffee concoctions. \u201cThey\u2019ve rolled out better food offerings and are selling more tea,\u201d he said. Starbucks is also striving to keep expanding in emerging markets like China.An advantage of investing in large, established outfits is downside protection when other stocks slip, Mr. Davidowitz said. \u201cOur portfolio tends to have lower volatility than the market,\u201d he said.Polen Growth, which has a net expense ratio of 1.25 percent, gained 0.7 percent in the third quarter.When investors short a stock, they borrow it and then sell it. When they must return the borrowed shares, they buy them. If the price has fallen, they profit. If it has risen, they lose. In theory, short sales are infinitely risky because a stock\u2019s potential rise has no ceiling.\u201cWe say there\u2019s risk in going long and in going short,\u201d Mr. Orkin said. \u201cShorts are riskier than longs on an individual basis. But when you have longs and shorts together in a portfolio, we believe it makes a lot more sense.\u201d In that view, shorting can represent an additional tool for diversification.Lately, Mr. Orkin has shorted for-profit education companies. He would not say which ones. \u201cTheir degrees are generally overpriced and of low quality,\u201d he said.He said he was also bearish on China\u2019s economic prospects and has capitalized on that belief by shorting commodity-sensitive companies like producers of copper, iron ore and mining machinery.For the fund\u2019s long positions, Mr. Orkin has lately favored the same sorts of investments that the Polen managers do: well-known, enduring companies that sell directly to consumers. The fund\u2019s recent holdings included Target, Walt Disney and Home Depot.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for stable, well-run longs,\u201d he said. Disney typifies that, with its sturdy brand and portfolio of movies, broadcast networks and theme parks. Plus, the economy has lately helped both Disney and Home Depot. \u201cLower gas prices are good for Disney\u2019s theme parks, and Home Depot is benefiting from the housing market recovery,\u201d he said.Mr. Orkin trades frequently; his fund\u2019s recent turnover ratio was 434 percent. He attributed that to his efforts to manage risk. \u201cWhen the market gets volatile, we tend to trade more,\u201d he said. But he said the goal was to achieve steady returns, even as he jumps in and out of investments. \u201cWe say we\u2019re trying to climb a staircase, not ride a roller coaster.\u201dThe fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.44 percent, returned 5.13 percent in the third quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IPhone\u00a0Demand Drives Apple Profit, but Outlook Is Muted", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe issue was stoked by Apple\u2019s muted forecast for its all-important holiday quarter, as well as the unwillingness of Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, to go into detail in an earnings conference call about how Apple plans to rev up sales next year.Over all, Apple posted a profit of $11.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $51.5 billion, up 22 percent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates.Yet while the performance was bolstered by sales of the iPhone \u2014 Apple said that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 39 million in the same period last year \u2014 the company was more cautious about sales for the key holiday sales period.Apple projected revenue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year quarter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell below Wall Street estimates and would amount to anemic growth of less than 4 percent from a year ago. The last time Apple\u2019s quarterly sales fell below 4 percent was in mid-2013.When asked on the earnings call about Apple\u2019s growth prospects in 2016, Mr. Cook also said, \u201cWe don\u2019t guide beyond a quarter.\u201dApple\u2019s stock price, which had initially risen after the earnings results, later ended up flat.The growth question is a quandary created by Apple\u2019s own success. The company has gotten investors accustomed to double-digit growth rates and enormous profit. That sets a high bar for Apple to clear each time and creates tough comparisons to beat later. Apple\u2019s holiday quarter last year was enormous, driven by the unveiling of the larger-screen iPhone 6 Plus, analysts said, making it difficult to compare to this time around.To keep up this kind of growth, analysts said Apple had only a few levers to pull: Attract more first-time customers, get more people to switch from rival Android-based phones and continue to grow in China.\u201cWe didn\u2019t get great visibility into the central question that we have about Apple,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cCan the iPhone grow in fiscal 2016?\u201dMr. Cook for the most part shrugged off the growth question. In the conference call, he said Apple\u2019s full fiscal year revenue growth was equivalent to that of almost 90 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500. Apple delivered \u201ca strong finish to a very strong year,\u201d even with a strong dollar that has forced the company to raise prices in many of its markets around the world, he said.While the iPhone continues to grow, the iPad has been facing declines. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPad sales dropped 20 percent from a year ago, making it the seventh consecutive quarter that sales of the tablet have slipped. The company is increasingly positioning the iPad as a business device.Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the numbers for the \u201cother\u201d category were in line with his expectations, and implied somewhere between 3.5 million and four million watches were sold over the quarter.One of Apple\u2019s fastest-growing markets \u2014 China \u2014 continued to grow. Sales in the region that Apple calls Greater China jumped 99 percent in the quarter to $12.5 billion. The region remained the company\u2019s second-largest market after the Americas, accounting for 24 percent of sales in the quarter, compared with 13.7 percent a year ago. Investors have been scrutinizing the China business given that the country has been cutting interest rates to shore up a slowing economy.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, also told investors that the company had $206 billion in cash, up $3 billion from last quarter, and that 91 percent of that money was held outside of the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY A data-driven exploration of the role of people, government, business and infrastructure in building future-ready economies.  A data-driven exploration of future-ready economies.  Across the country in Riverside, Calif., more than 30 years\u2019 worth of infrastructure projects were completed in just five years, thanks to innovative technology and creative financing. The Los Angeles suburb also set up classes outside classrooms to teach residents how to write code, hosts hackathons and is working with an insurance company to fund the planting of more trees.  Innovations like those in Boston and Riverside are easy to spot, but many cities are finding them hard to reproduce. To identify ways to jumpstart the process, municipal officials, entrepreneurs, technology executives and scholars gathered on the campus of Harvard University to discuss lessons from the world\u2019s most innovative cities.  \u201cOur goal is to simply understand how our communities and cities can play a role in enabling an innovation economy of the future,\u201d said Professor David Ricketts, who chaired the 2015 Strategic Innovation Summit: Enabling Economies for the Future. The event, sponsored by Dell, was hosted by the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard.  The benefits of rethinking how government and services work are clear. Innovations like those in Boston, Riverside and other leading cities are leveraging technology and new ways of thinking to make communities more attractive places to live. That\u2019s attracting more businesses that need the workers. As the population and economy grow, more ideas and more innovation follow. It\u2019s a self\u2010 perpetuating cycle that\u2019s defining the modern thriving community.  At the summit, officials highlighted several examples of different innovations around the world but stressed merely copying an app or service isn\u2019t enough. But common themes emerged. All innovative cities adopted a methodical approach to innovation that fosters a culture of experimentation. They also looked outside traditional government frameworks to avoid bureaucracy. They found and worked with partners both inside and outside government on shared visions. And they adapted ideas from companies and cities to suit their own needs.  In several cases, the path to innovation started with a newly elected mayor who wanted to realize campaign promises and modernize basic city services.  Ted Smith, chief innovation officer for Louisville, Ky., said his department was set up after a businessman was elected mayor and wanted his administration to do more than just put out fires and provide basic services. The mayor borrowed a page from business playbooks and created a position that was responsible for finding and implementing initiatives.  \u201cIt\u2019s the one\u2010throat\u2010to\u2010choke school of management,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you have to get something done and you don\u2019t have someone accountable, it doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d  At first, there was little assistance from city coffers. Smith\u2019s team looked to partner with like\u2010 minded philanthropies to implement ideas. In 2012, Louisville was awarded $5 million from the Bloomberg Foundation to improve services by collecting and analyzing data.  The city is now studying whether it can prevent heroin addiction by analyzing pharmacy records for people who have been denied prescriptions for painkillers \u2014 an indicator of someone who might turn to street drugs.  Smith said his group focuses its projects on areas that need improvement, and they\u2019re often found in rankings where the city fares poorly.  \u201cThat\u2019s where the headroom is \u2014 there\u2019s no organization chasing it,\u201d he said.  Data collection and analysis also play a role in Burlington, Vt., where Beth Anderson serves as chief innovation officer. Like Boston, Burlington is making it easier for people to interact with government for basic city services. But her office will analyze those interactions for patterns, which will then be studied to improve apps and other tools even more.  \u201cInnovation shouldn\u2019t be special. It should be day\u2010to\u2010day,\u201d she says. \u201cInnovation can be little things.\u201d  Innovation, however, can be a risky endeavor, but several speakers at the summit identified ways to mitigate the risks. Boston\u2019s Urban Mechanics Project, which worked on numerous popular apps for tracking buses, potholes and improving interactions with City Hall, treats each project as an experiment.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very iterative process,\u201d said Nigel Jacob, the group\u2019s co\u2010chair. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to people constantly and getting user feedback.  \u201cThen there\u2019s a pause at the end of experimentation where we sit down and look at what we learned,\u201d he says. \u201cDid it work? If it did, how do we scale it? If it\u2019s failing, we shut it down as quickly as possible.\u201d  His office also creates a safe place for city departments to experiment. If a project succeeds, the department gets all the credit. If it fails, Jacob\u2019s group steps in and takes the blame. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide a safe place for experimentation,\u201d he said.  But even successes can bring challenges. If something new succeeds, it\u2019s likely to displace legacy systems and sometimes even livelihoods, Ricketts said.  \u201cWe need to embrace change but realize that disruptive innovations have an ugly twin, which is disruptive obsolescence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand that&aposs part of the innovation process, and part of what we need to plan.\u201d  \u201cThen there\u2019s a pause at the end of experimentation where we sit down and look at what we learned,\u201d he says. \u201cDid it work?

If it fails, Jacob\u2019s group steps in and takes the blame. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide a safe place for experimentation,\u201d he said.  Cities might be reluctant to experiment since they\u2019re already facing significant headwinds ranging from a general mistrust of government to shrinking budgets. Most also wrestle with laws and regulations that were enacted before technology accelerated the pace of life and business.  Technology, though, also provides solutions. After all, computers are now ubiquitous, storage is practically free, radio\u2010equipped sensors cost just pennies and potential collaborators are easy to work with, regardless of location. None of this was possible or affordable just five or 10 years ago, said Glenn Wintrich, Dell\u2019s Innovation Lead.  \u201cWe now have this confluence of technology where it&aposs not only viable and feasible but also inexpensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThat&aposs really key for cities.\u201d Dell.com/FutureReadyEconomies Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

I had a noncompete clause when I signed the contract in 1990, but we negotiated which clients I could represent. They asked me which clients I was comfortable with and would like to go with me. I gave them a rather short list. Richard LeFrak, the most modest billionaire in the business. My job with Richard when I undertook it was to change the image of what people perceived as Sam LeFrak\u2019s company, which was basically affordable housing, into a dynamic development owner who builds exciting, exceptionally designed property.

Most Americans know the story of that hot Philadelphia summer in 1787 when prolonged debate led to the creation of the United States Constitution to overcome the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation. Disagreements about the extent of federal power and the design of our democratic institutions were resolved through long arguments and, ultimately, principled compromises. Few Americans, on the other hand, are familiar with the analogous history of periodic financial crises and economic duress throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that gave rise to the creation of an effective American central banking system. Decades of fervent debate finally led to the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. That is the story Roger Lowenstein tells, vividly and compellingly, in \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank.\u201d It should be required reading for anyone who is engaged in, or interested in, the actions of the modern Fed, and the continuing debates about those actions and about its governance.The remarkable tale of the politics, disagreements, decisions and crises that culminated in the Federal Reserve Act is the core of the book. But Lowenstein, the author of several works on economics and finance, builds off it to describe the history of the era, the rise of the Progressive movement, the compromises and machinations that were critical to Congressional passage and the key figures in the drama of creating the Federal Reserve System. Lowenstein depicts the end of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th as a time of profound transformation. The transition from a predominantly agricultural nation toward an industrial economy parallels the transition we are undergoing today to an information economy. From new technologies and growing global integration, to the stark contrast between the \u00adwages and working conditions of many American workers and the vast wealth accrued by a few, the forces then driving change created policy \u00adchallenges of great consequence, just as today\u2019s changes do. Lowenstein highlights the similarity between the arguments then and now over the structure of our financial system: the governance and powers of a central bank, its relationship with private financial institutions, the appropriate scope of Congressional oversight and much else. Then as now, these debates took place against a social and political backdrop that is particular to our country\u2019s history \u2014 wariness of central government; antagonism toward banks; and the divergent interests of farmers, merchants, manufacturers and financiers in widely different regions. And Lowenstein\u2019s account of financial crises before the establishment of the Fed powerfully demonstrates that it is imperative for the Federal Reserve System to maintain its effectiveness and independence from politics.The decades leading up to the Fed\u2019s creation were punctuated by repeated financial crises, culminating in the ferocious panic of 1907. The shortage of cash was so great that, as Lowenstein puts it, the nation seemed to be \u201creverting toward barter.\u201d These disruptions may have been severe and frequent, but they were largely problems of liquidity, not episodes of widespread insolvency. Lowenstein explains how harvest season routinely produced financial turmoil. Without a centralized mechanism to adjust the supply of currency or to lend to solvent banks experiencing liquidity pressures, the demand for money to pay workers and to finance the purchase of agricultural goods drove interest rates up and reduced the availability of credit. This stifled growth precisely when it should have been accommodated.More broadly, Lowenstein contrasts the relative stability of the major European economies with American financial instability during the period. He shows that the United States needed what Europe had, but we lacked: a central banking arrangement that could mobilize reserves across the entire system, to serve as lender of last resort to solvent banks and to provide an \u201celastic currency\u201d that could be expanded when demand for currency increased or contracted when times became too frothy. Interestingly, managing aggregate demand in the economy through monetary policy \u2014 the principal focus of the Fed in recent decades \u2014 didn\u2019t develop in practice until after World War II.The panic of 1907 involved not only sweeping bank failures, but the collapse of non-bank trusts, the shadow banking system of the day, like the venerable Knickerbocker Trust Company on Fifth Avenue. As with so much else in Lowenstein\u2019s history, these trust company failures foreshadowed a serious contemporary challenge: regulating shadow banking institutions and activities that are growing rapidly because they are not subject to the heightened constraints on banks. Lowenstein also gives us striking portraits of key figures, well known and unknown, involved in the creation of our central bank. William Jennings Bryan, remembered as a commanding figure in the Democratic Party and the Populist movement, exercised great statesmanship in abandoning his longstanding opposition to a central bank; he provided crucial support for the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. President Woodrow Wilson, whom many remember as an austere former academic who ultimately lost his battle for the League of Nations, is portrayed in the book as having almost Lyndon Johnson-like legislative skills, cajoling, pressuring and corralling members of Congress to support legislation. Among the legislators who figure prominently in Lowenstein\u2019s large cast of characters are Senator Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Carter Glass of Virginia, who led the charge in the House. And the immigrant financier Paul Warburg, virtually forgotten today, who for decades was an advocate of an effective central banking system, emerges as one of the book\u2019s heroes.Lowenstein\u2019s history makes clear just how critical the exercise of practical politics and the willingness to compromise were. The first Congress of Wilson\u2019s presidency enacted a host of groundbreaking measures unimaginable in today\u2019s political environment: a progressive income tax; the direct election of senators; tariff reduction; the Clayton Antitrust Act; and, of course, the Federal Reserve Act, which Lowenstein labels the \u201ccrowning achievement\u201d of Wilson\u2019s presidency.The Federal Reserve System, as Lowenstein observes, has, like our Constitution, been a living organism. Its powers, while grounded in its original functions, have been adapted to meet the evolving needs of our financial system and economy. And while \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank\u201d concludes with the establishment of the Fed, it alludes to how the creative adaptation of the Fed\u2019s original powers was critical in dealing with the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed\u2019s effectiveness, Lowenstein notes, ultimately depends on human judgment. During the early years of the Great Depression, for example, instead of using its lender-of-last-resort powers, the Fed stood by while roughly 40 percent of America\u2019s banks failed. And these bank failures contributed greatly to the severity and duration of the Depression. Then, in the 1970s, the Fed again stood by as inflation rose to a peacetime high until Paul Volcker was appointed chairman and took strong measures to restore stability. Protecting the independence of the Fed from political influence was built into its creation and, as Lowenstein demonstrates, is critical to the effective use of its powers, to its credibility and to the credibility of our markets. All that is vital, both because of the inherent cyclicality of economies and because of the never-ending need to prevent \u2014 and, when necessary, mitigate \u2014 financial disruptions. It\u2019s true that the Federal Reserve has sometimes exercised poor judgment. What is clear, however, is that a number of the reforms currently being proposed in Congress could undermine the system\u2019s effectiveness by adversely affecting the Fed\u2019s independence from Congressional political influence and reducing its \u00adpolicy-making flexibility. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank\u201d provides a dire warning against such actions. And thanks to Lowenstein, the largely untold story of the great financial debates of the 19th and early 20th centuries, together with the creation of our Federal Reserve System, can now take their rightful place in the history of American democracy and the evolution of the United States into a global financial power.

{"Headline": "In Argentina Elections, Tight Vote Yields Presidential Runoff", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPointing to a remarkably tight race, Daniel Scioli, a former vice president supported by Mrs. Kirchner, took 35.7 percent of the vote with 84 percent of balloting stations tallied, against 35.3 percent for Mr. Macri. The votes obtained by Mr. Macri, a former president of one of Argentina\u2019s most popular soccer clubs who ran to the right of his rivals, upend a race in which Mr. Scioli was viewed as a strong front-runner.The candidates signaled an intense new phase of campaigning ahead of the runoff election on Nov. 22. Sergio Massa, a former ally of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s who moved into the opposition, could find himself in the role of kingmaker after securing 21 percent of the vote in the partial count, with analysts questioning whether he will forge an alliance with Mr. Macri.\u201cI invite you to conquer our future,\u201d Mr. Macri, 56, said Sunday night, in a conciliatory speech before the first official results were released after midnight, as he positioned his campaign to lure more voters.With Mrs. Kirchner, 62, constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, the leading candidates ran carefully orchestrated campaigns that seemed to reflect a longing in the electorate for a break with her divisive governing style. Mrs. Kirchner intensified attacks on opponents in the news media and business establishment after succeeding her late husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, as president in 2007.\u201cMore moderation is expected as the Kirchner era comes to a close,\u201d said Mariel Fornoni, director of Management and Fit, a leading polling company. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous desire in society for less polarization.\u201dMr. Scioli, 58, a former speedboat racer, sought to appeal to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters by contending that he did not plan any abrupt policy shifts. Lacking her combative rhetorical spirit, he came across as a safe option for many voters who want continuity for programs that have increased social welfare spending over the past 12 years.\u201cI never won a race smashing into a competitor\u2019s boat,\u201d Mr. Scioli told reporters during the campaign. \u201cTo the contrary, I always look to improve on what\u2019s been achieved.\u201dEven though Mr. Scioli seemed to fall short of obtaining the support on Sunday of some die-hard supporters of Mrs. Kirchner, the possibility of continuity under Mr. Scioli appealed to many voters.Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.\u201cScioli is with the poor people,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Rosa Gonz\u00e1lez, 66, a maid who voted for him on Sunday. She explained that her late father, a corn harvester, had been able to claim a state pension under a 2005 law supported by the Kirchners in which workers who had not paid contributions could collect retirement benefits. \u201cThis government helped the people. It\u2019s on display.\u201dEconomists here argue over the costs of such policies, with some saying that Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s successor will have to grapple with galloping inflation and a yawning budget deficit. But her supporters say that antipoverty spending was badly needed in the country after a chaotic economic collapse and political turmoil in 2001 and 2002.Mr. Macri, a civil engineer by training, said he would introduce market-oriented changes aiming to loosen currency controls and lure great investment into Argentina\u2019s economy, standing in contrast to his rivals.While voting unfolded peacefully around the country, the leading candidate needed more than 45 percent of the vote, or 40 percent and a margin larger than 10 points over the nearest rival, to avoid the runoff. The delay by the authorities in releasing the results, which were made public about six hours after polls had closed, left much of the country on tenterhooks.Throughout the race, many voters and analysts here were struck as much by the similarities among the leading candidates as their differences, reflecting strategies of offering a nonthreatening alternative to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s commanding presence. Even Mr. Macri, who began campaigning from another part of the ideological spectrum, sought to appeal to supporters of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that dominates Argentine politics.Kirchnerismo, the leftist movement named for the Kirchners, came to overshadow other factions aligned with Peronism, which originated decades ago during the rule of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n. Mindful of the hazards of opposing Peronist power brokers, the three men adopted reserved campaign styles, leading some to suggest that a composite candidate could easily be made of Mr. Scioli, Mr. Macri and Mr. Massa.\u201cHe is an amiable, middle-of-the-road, middle-class, middle-aged and fairly athletic bloke of Italian extraction who, with a winning smile, tells us that the country can easily overcome all its many economic and social problems,\u201d James Neilson wrote in a column in The Buenos Aires Herald.A selection of toned-down candidates suited some voters just fine. \u201cHe\u2019s less bellicose, less divisive,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Quadri, 28, an architect who voted for Mr. Macri, contending the candidate would have \u201cmore logical international policies.\u201dEying the possibility of an alliance between Mr. Macri and Mr. Massa, political analysts were examining how many of Mr. Massa\u2019s supporters could help swing the vote. Some estimate that about a third of Mr. Massa\u2019s support came from dissident Peronists who could actually swing back to Mr. Scioli, potentially handing him a victory.\u201cThat greatly limits Massa\u2019s margin for maneuver,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. Still, he said Mr. Macri would have already contemplated how to court this 30 percent, pointing to a statue of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, the founder of Peronism, that Mr. Macri recently unveiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why he inaugurated the statue,\u201d Mr. Berensztein said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Vladimir Putin Trying to Teach the West a Lesson in Syria?", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 Last week, after Russian planes bombed antigovernment forces near the Syrian town of Homs, a senior American official complained to me: \u201cWhat Russia is doing in Syria is not an effort to fight the Islamic State; it is not old-fashioned realpolitik. It is not even a cynical attempt to make us forget about Ukraine. Putin simply wants to hurt us.\u201dThis notion of Russia as a \u201cspoiling power\u201d is a popular sentiment today in Washington. But what does this spoiling power actually want? Is Russia in Syria simply for the sport of watching a humiliated President Obama? Is damaging the value of American power the only purpose of Russia\u2019s \u201cspoiling\u201d?It\u2019s more accurate to say that the Kremlin is in Syria for pedagogical reasons: It wants to teach Americans a lesson, and a valuable one. It wants to show that America should either be prepared to intervene in any civil war that follows a troubled revolution inspired by its lofty rhetoric, or it should quit goading people to revolt. \u201cDo you realize, what you have done?\u201d was the most memorable line of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s speech at the United Nations General Assembly.The situation in Syria may have an element of realpolitik to it, but it is also about two worldviews. Indeed, the differences between Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama can be boiled down to opposing theories about the sources of the current global instability. America sees global instability primarily as the result of authoritarians\u2019 desperate attempts to preserve a doomed status quo, while Moscow blames Washington\u2019s obsession with democracy.If the Soviets appealed to proletarians of the world to unite, the Kremlin today appeals to governments of the world to unite \u2014 all kind of governments. History is indeed \u201cirony on the move.\u201d Russia, the successor of the revolutionary Soviet Union, has given up on the power of the people.Most of the popular history books on the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 you can find in Moscow bookstores today tell the story of Lenin and his comrades not as a popular uprising, but as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, engineered by \u2014 and here you have a choice \u2014 the German general staff or British intelligence agents. Any time and any place when people demand power, the situation gets worse. Loyalty and stability are at the center of the Kremlin\u2019s universe, a universe dominated by insecurity and fear of the future.And what is on Kremlin\u2019s mind is not Syria, or even Ukraine, but Central Asia, a part of the post-Soviet space in which authoritarian leaders are aging, economies are stagnating, millions of restless young people are unemployed and eager to emigrate, and radical Islam is on the rise. Russia sees itself as the guarantor of stability in the region, but it fears instability coming. Central Asia today reminds the Kremlin of the Middle East a decade ago. Could Syria teach America to watch its words and mind its business when the next crisis comes?President Putin wants to teach America a lesson, but he also speaks to a Europe flooded by a million refugees and haunted by the specters of radical Islam and demographic anxiety. Yesterday the European Union hoped to transform its neighbors; today it sees itself as a hostage. Mr. Putin wants to persuade Europe that, as brutal a dictator as Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya was, he was willing and able to protect the borders of Europe, something the new democracies could not do.Is a badly shaken Europe prepared for this message?Yes and no. Most European leaders hope for U.S.-Russian cooperation in Syria as the only way to end the conflict. They want Moscow on their side. Many blame the hyperactivity of George W. Bush and the inaction of Barack Obama for the turmoil in the Middle East. They hope for the return to the days of Soviet-American d\u00e9tente, when, as the historian Jeremi Suri has written, \u201cLeaders abandoned their hopes for political change in order to smother the challenges they faced at home.\u201dThat, at least, is \u201cPutin\u2019s hypothesis\u201d \u2014 that Europe will accept a more powerful Russia as a guarantor of stability, even at the cost of a European retreat from its values and ambitions.But can Mr. Putin deliver? His call for absolute stability is emotionally attractive but impractical. If in the straitjacket of the Cold War it was enough for the Soviet Union and the West to cut a deal for instability to recede, this is no longer the case. The world is no longer defined by East-West dynamics: Social, demographic, cultural and technological changes have made world stability a much more complicated puzzle. We live in the age of disruption.And though Russia is right to argue that what we see in Syria today is not a clash between a repressive government and its freedom-loving people, it is also not a clash between legitimate government and a bunch of extremists, as Moscow insists. It is worth remembering that the vast majority of refugees in Europe are running not from the Islamic State, but from the Assad regime, and its hold on power means that they could stay in Europe forever.In other words, Mr. Putin\u2019s pedagogy is appealing, but it is not, ultimately, persuasive. It will take more than a change in American policy for people to stop revolting against ugly governments.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, and a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Care Companies in Merger Frenzy", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a fast-paced financial version of musical chairs, health care companies of all kinds \u2014 drug makers, hospital groups and insurers \u2014 have been frantically circling to be sure they are not left out of the latest frenzy of deal making. Mergers and acquisitions worth about $270 billion have been announced in the first nine months of 2015 in the United States, easily outpacing the activity in recent years, according to a tally by Mergermarket.On Thursday, Allergan, itself the product of a recent merger, said it was in talks to be bought by Pfizer in a deal that could easily become the year\u2019s biggest deal. Allergan\u2019s current market value is $113 billion.But the quest for size goes beyond the drug industry. The year\u2019s biggest deals included mergers among the nation\u2019s five largest health insurance companies, which pursued one another until only three may remain. Anthem is trying to buy Cigna for nearly $50 billion, and Aetna is pursuing Humana. Only UnitedHealth Group remains without a partner.But UnitedHealth, which has created a portfolio of health care businesses, fortified its pharmacy benefit manager, known as OptumRx, by buying Catamaran Corporation a fast-growing competitor, this year. The combined entity, which is expected to process more than one billion prescriptions in 2015, is better equipped to compete with the industry giants Express Scripts and CVS Health, which operates CVS/caremark in addition to drugstores. CVS, in turn, acquired Omnicare to broaden its reach into nursing homes and bought 1,700 pharmacies from Target.Not to be outdone, earlier this week, Walgreens Boots Alliance, the giant drugstore chain, said it planned to buy Rite Aid, a competitor.The activity has been dizzying among pharmaceutical companies, always in the market for a promising new drug or pipeline. Last November, Actavis bought Allergan, the Botox maker, and took its name. The combined company then decided to sell its generic business to Teva Pharmaceuticals for around $40 billion. Allergan says its talks with Pfizer do not affect that deal.Then there were the mergers that weren\u2019t: AbbVie, a drug maker, dropped its deal with Shire of Ireland, at least temporarily ending the flurry of \u201ctax inversion\u201d mergers that had occurred as a way to cut tax obligations by merging with an overseas company. AbbVie cited new federal rules that made such deals less attractive. But then the company set its sights on an easier target: Pharmacyclics, which offers an attractive cancer drug.Pfizer\u2019s flirtation with Allergan, which may not come to fruition, could represent a return to American drug makers\u2019 strategy of finding a base overseas. Allergan\u2019s headquarters are technically in Dublin, and Pfizer had made an earlier run at AstraZeneca in London.Low interest rates and cheap capital are fueling merger activity across many industries, but health care is especially devoted to the mantra that bigger is always better. And there are both the short-term goal of increasing revenue and the longer-term need to restructure in response to changes in the health care landscape under the Affordable Care Act. Unlike other areas, like telecommunications, where a tremendous amount of consolidation has already occurred, health care has been fragmented, with many smaller players.All of the parties are under intense pressure to reduce costs, and consolidation is seen as necessary to do so, especially among smaller entities like hospitals. \u201cThere is serious economy of scale to be accomplished,\u201d said Dr. Kaveh Safavi, the managing director for Accenture\u2019s global health practice.Hospitals continue to join forces to create a larger presence in their markets or regional systems. In New Jersey, for example, in July, Barnabas Health and Robert Wood Johnson Health System. announced plans to combine. That will create the state\u2019s largest hospital network, with 11 hospitals. Hospitals have also been buying physician groups.\u201cScale matters,\u201d said Mark Claster, a partner at Carl Marks Advisors who specializes in hospital mergers and is chairman of the board for North Shore-LIJ Health System, which is renaming itself Northwell Health.Hospitals are looking for the size and clout necessary to negotiate with insurance companies, he said, but they are also preparing for changes in how they are paid in which they assume financial risk for how much it costs to care for patients.Hospitals are also supersizing so they can invest more in technology and computer systems that allow them to better track patients\u2019 care.While many of the recent acquisitions involve hospitals combining with hospitals, Dr. Safavi of Accenture predicted that future activity would focus more on hospitals buying medical specialty groups , adding clinics or even acquiring digital health companies that may specialize in giving people in remote locations access to doctors. Accenture predicts the share of hospital-hospital mergers will fall to about 6 percent of transactions by 2018, from 21 percent in 2014.Politics aside, the Affordable Health Care Act is credited with accelerating the pace of change. Many of the pressures to combine existed before the law was passed, but it has forced health insurers and hospitals to try to reduce costs.Consumer advocates and others worry that some of the big deals, including those being proposed by large for-profit health insurers, will not benefit consumers. They say competition could decline significantly in some businesses, like private Medicare plans, and in some local markets where there may already be one or two powerful players. Consumers may pay more because, without competitors, insurers could raise premiums or hospitals could raise prices.In many cases, however, the acquisitions, are likely to be under regulators\u2019 radar said Leemore S. Dafny, a former regulator who is now a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. This could especially be the case if they are not two hospital groups joining forces but a health system adding another cardiology group or buying a home health business in its market, she said. Little information may be available about the impact of these deals on a market, she said, and she predicted that antitrust concerns would not stop much of the consolidation.Any large transaction is going to get a careful regulatory review by federal and state officials. The Justice Department is looking at the insurance mergers, and the Federal Trade Commission has scrutinized some of the hospital mergers, including one in which a hospital system acquired a physician practice.\u201cThe big question for regulators is, Where does that leave consumers and purchasers like employers?\u201d said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question.\u201dBut certain types of deals, especially those that create behemoths, could run afoul of government officials, she warned. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for backlash,\u201d she said, not unlike the federal government\u2019s reaction to the spate of tax inversion mergers.If regulators take firm action against these deals, \u201cit would be a splash of cold water,\u201d Ms. Connolly said, and might dissuade other entities from pursuing similar acquisitions.The short answer is yes. Drug makers, hospitals and health insurers, drugstore chains and pharmacy benefit managers are all seeking to bulk up to gain more leverage in negotiating with the other sides.While the overall state of the economy and other factors could curb the enthusiasm for deals, health care are likely to continue because of the Affordable Care Act and the resultant pressure to deliver better care at lower prices. Mergers beget more mergers, as hospitals seek to keep up with their rivals down the street, and everyone looks for more power in negotiations with payers.\u201cOur view from the ground is that the pace will continue,\u201d said Torrey McClary, a lawyer for Hogan Lovells who specializes in mergers. \u201cNobody is sitting still. Everybody in the industry is thinking hard about their next move.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It says it will not allow any such asylum seekers to settle in Australia.Australia said it was spending more than $700 million on aid and infrastructure development for Papua New Guinea as part of a 2013 agreement to house and process asylum seekers there. The camp, which is restricted to single men, held 936 detainees as of August. It has been the site of sexual assaults and unrest, including a riot in February 2014 that left a 23-year-old asylum seeker from Iran dead.\u201cThe P.N.G. government has shown with this announcement its commitment to permit those found to be refugees to get on with their lives and have a fresh start in this dynamic nation with a growing economy,\u201d Mr. Dutton said.But advocates have said that conditions could prove difficult for refugees in Papua New Guinea, which has one of the world\u2019s highest crime rates. Its capital, Port Moresby, has high unemployment and is often ranked in surveys as one of the world\u2019s least livable cities.Rimbink Pato, Papua New Guinea\u2019s minister of foreign affairs and immigration, said in a statement this week that the resettlement policy had taken time to develop. \u201cIt is crucial that we get this right,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cSettlement of refugees is not easy, and we have to ensure refugees are not competing for employment and income-earning opportunities with our citizens.\u201dAustralia has made previous attempts to resettle offshore detainees in other countries, with little success. It spent $29 million on a plan to send some to Cambodia, but just four have moved there over the past year. Australia\u2019s highest court recently heard a challenge to its asylum-seeker policies, brought on behalf of detainees who went to Australia for medical treatment.

{"Headline": "Britain's \u2018Brexit\u2019 Folly", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The little Englanders and their enablers determined to take Britain out of the European Union believe the perfect storm is upon them.Look across the Channel, they argue, and see the hordes of desperate refugees intent on disrupting the British way of life (whatever they imagine that to be) and living off British welfare. Look beyond them and see the 19-member eurozone mired in the agony of its flawed creation. Look at the whole European Continent, with its sluggish economies and myriad regulations, and imagine a glorious island nation freed from the burdens of an unhappy association with the complex-ridden losers of World War II!It\u2019s all baloney, and dangerous baloney at that, fanned by the Murdoch press, the anti-immigrant hatemongers of the U.K. Independence Party, and the sovereignty-obsessed conservative backbenchers of Prime Minister David Cameron who believe Britain can boss it again in the world if unbound from the shackles of Brussels and bureaucrats intent on stipulating the shape of cucumbers.The fact is the European Union has been good for Britain \u2014 its economy, its openness, its culture, its financial services and its global clout. Postwar imperial decline has been offset by European construction. The British overcoat has become ampler. But such is the jingoistic clamor that Cameron has blinked and, either next year or the year after that, Britain will vote (for the first time since 1975) on whether to remain part of the European Union. The vote will be definitive.\u201cIt\u2019s losable,\u201d Pat McFadden, a Labour Party member of Parliament and staunch supporter of continued membership, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s winnable, too. Neither side should make assumptions. You could have a nationalist anti-immigration thing that comes together at the very moment when the euro and the refugee crisis are being discussed.\u201dA vote to leave, for McFadden, would be a disaster \u2014 not just for the economy, trade, investment and jobs \u2014 but also for Britain\u2019s place in the world. Britain does nearly half its trade with other European Union countries and, as an E.U. member, is part of a $18.5 trillion economy, larger than that of the United States. Exports to the European Union support over 4 million jobs, directly or indirectly. On its own, Britain is a significant pygmy, with less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population and less than 3 percent of global output; it is not in the 21st-century major league.Moreover, as McFadden told me, \u201cIf Britain leaves the E.U., Scotland will leave Britain.\u201d A pro-European Scotland, now a virtual Scottish nationalist one-party state, will be able to argue circumstances have changed since the referendum last year produced a majority for remaining part of the United Kingdom. Scotland will demand another vote. And so a British exit from Europe could well mean the end of the very Great Britain proudly invoked by the shoot-yourself-in-the-foot \u201cBrexit\u201d brigade.Like empires, nations do break up. Sometimes the process is inevitable, sometimes precipitated by folly. Britain could commit an act of folly by leaving the European Union. That would not be in its nature. Britain\u2019s force has been tied to practicality, prudence and openness. But an age of rage is upon us. Anything is possible. The refugee issue is typical of the way emotion has displaced reason. Very few have come to Britain, which opted out of the Schengen Agreement, removing border checks between 26 European countries. Britain is, however, part of the Dublin Regulation requiring E.U. governments to process asylum seekers in the first country they reach \u2014 a regulation that, over the years, has enabled Britain to send back thousands of people to their place of entry into the Union. In effect, as Hugo Dixon puts it in his important book \u201cThe In/Out Question,\u201d Britain has enjoyed \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201dAn exit, as Dixon told me, would turn Britain from \u201crule maker into rule taker.\u201d It would presumably want to remain part of a single market of half a billion people (as Norway is, despite not being a European Union member), but would no longer have any say in how that market is shaped. Britain would equally lose its place at the table in the discussion of European banking and financial services, a vital sector. As Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said in a speech this month, British economic \u201cdynamism\u201d \u2014 he used the word several times \u2014 has been boosted by the European Union because Britain \u201chas successfully harnessed the benefits of openness afforded by its E.U. membership\u201d while avoiding the \u201creduced flexibility\u201d of some continental European economies. Britain has grown through the euro crisis.Carney\u2019s speech was timely. The field has been dominated for too long by the bloviating \u201cBrexit\u201d camp. Cameron must no longer wait for a cosmetic renegotiation of Britain\u2019s deal with the European Union before declaring that opting for \u201cout\u201d is opting for decline, illusion, the past and marginalization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Role in the Syrian Crisis", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIran\u2019s presence in Vienna on Thursday and Friday won\u2019t guarantee an end to Syria\u2019s prolonged agony, but it improves the chances that a solution can be found. Russia, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are also expected to attend.The United States, Russia and Europe failed at earlier efforts to reach a negotiated end to Syria\u2019s civil war, which has raged since 2011, and created such chaos that the murderous Islamic State has been able to seize vast swaths of territory. There are many reasons for that failure, chiefly Russia\u2019s obstinacy, but one is the refusal to include Iran, which with Moscow provides vital support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.Not everyone will be happy to see Iran at the table. Saudi Arabia, deeply suspicious of Iran\u2019s regional ambitions, argues that negotiating with Iran only legitimizes a government that is exerting malign influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria. The Saudis, who are Sunnis, fought especially hard to keep Shiite Iran, its main regional rival, from the Vienna meeting and it took a trip to Riyadh on Saturday by Secretary of State John Kerry and a phone call on Tuesday by President Obama to Saudi King Salman to win them over.The Saudis want Mr. Assad removed from power and the Iranians removed from any post-Assad Syria. They have reportedly tried to enlist President Vladimir Putin of Russia in these objectives with offers of assistance for Russia\u2019s battered economy. Mr. Putin reportedly told the Saudis that he agreed that Iran\u2019s role in Syria is too big, but that he could not guarantee Mr. Assad\u2019s removal.The Saudis aside, most of the negotiators in Vienna would be delighted by progress on a framework for a transition from Mr. Assad to a more inclusive government. While Mr. Assad needs to leave, the change must be done carefully, retaining the institutions that help keep the state intact. Ideally, a political solution would lead to a more unified multinational campaign against the Islamic State and an eventual end to all foreign involvement in Syria.Given the mixed messages, no one knows yet what Iran will do, but it has a chance to make a difference in Syria. Its involvement in Vienna will be a test of whether it intends to play a constructive role in the region and in ending Mr. Assad\u2019s brutal war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New York Film Festival Contrasts the Human Pulse and the Digital", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookA counterbalance to that film\u2019s futuristic chill is Michael Moore\u2019s jolly new travelogue, \u201cWhere to Invade Next,\u201d in which this left-wing filmmaker jokingly imagines \u201cinvading\u201d other countries, mostly in Europe and Scandinavia, and importing their advantages. The happy interviewees voice their belief in community responsibility rather than the American dream of individual wealth and achievement. There is hardly a digital product to be seen.\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d draws a cinematic dividing line between a shiny new digital future and the scruffy old past, and it envisions a man-machine interface in which people merge with devices that ultimately separate them from others.The last time a movie so dominated the New York Film Festival was five years ago, when \u201cThe Social Network\u201d was its opening-night selection. \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d like \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d has a voluble, fast-talking screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (working from Walter Isaacson\u2019s 2011 biography), and focuses on three moments in Jobs\u2019s life, each constructed around the rollout of different products: the Macintosh, in 1984; the NeXT cube, in 1988; and the iMac, in 1998. Kate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman, his marketing guru; Seth Rogen his early partner, Steve Wozniak; and Jeff Daniels the Apple chief executive John Sculley, with whom Jobs had a stormy relationship.The film in the festival\u2019s middle section that most strongly echoes Jobs\u2019s obsession with science and technology is Michael Almereyda\u2019s \u201cExperimenter,\u201d a portrait of the social scientist Stanley Milgram (a mesmerizing Peter Sarsgaard), who in one of many surreal touches is seen being followed around by an elephant.Milgram created the notorious 1961 obedience study at Yale in which test subjects, situated out of sight of one another, were assigned the roles of \u201cteacher\u201d and \u201clearner.\u201d The learner was asked multiple-choice questions that, if answered incorrectly, provoked remote-controlled electric shocks administered by the teacher. Or seemed to.Unbeknown to the teacher, the learner was actually an assistant who simulated the agonized cries of someone being tortured, and no shocks were delivered. When the teacher protested, Milgram declared in an authoritarian voice that the experiment must continue. In most cases, the teacher reluctantly obeyed and cringed each time he heard the groans from the other room. The experiment\u2019s conclusions about people\u2019s reflexive obedience to authority were grim.The most intense of several interlocking stories is Paul\u2019s tormented relationship with Esther (the charismatic Lou Roy-Lecollinet), an irresistible teenage siren. In Mr. Desplechin\u2019s universe, young love is not something to look back on with fond amusement but the pinnacle of life experience.Philippe Garrel\u2019s perceptive black-and-white \u201cIn the Shadow of Women\u201d examines marital infidelity and the different ways a couple, Pierre (Stanislas Merhar) and Manon (Clotilde Courau), documentary filmmakers, deal with it. The characters in Michel Gondry\u2019s likable comedy \u201cMicrobe & Gasoline\u201d are teenage misfits who build a house on wheels and visit a camp one of them attended as a child.An American movie that in places has the flavor of a French farce is Rebecca Miller\u2019s serious screwball comedy, \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d set in New York City and starring Greta Gerwig as the title character. Maggie, a single woman and control freak, falls in love with John (Ethan Hawke), a married professor and aspiring novelist just as she is about to impregnate herself with donated sperm. Julianne Moore, adopting a Danish accent, plays Georgette, the high-strung wife John abandons.At its best, this frantic movie, sprinkled with hilarious one-liners, rises to the level of vintage Woody Allen. To quote its unofficial Bruce Springsteen theme song, which is heard twice in the film, its characters are all \u201cdancing in the dark.\u201dOn the festival\u2019s low-tech end, \u201cDon\u2019t Blink \u2014 Robert Frank\u201d is an informal portrait of Mr. Frank, now 90, in which the photographer and documentary filmmaker tells the editor-director Laura Israel his own story. Mr. Frank\u2019s book \u201cThe Americans,\u201d his groundbreaking survey of everyday American faces photographed in the tradition of Walker Evans, remains his crowning achievement. Mr. Frank personifies a defiant individuality that the festival celebrates.The most upbeat film in the festival\u2019s midsection turns to be Mr. Moore\u2019s documentary. An impassioned humanistic tract, it compares many aspects of American life unfavorably with their European counterparts. French schoolchildren are served nutritious gourmet meals; Italian factory workers are given long vacations and generous benefits. Finland\u2019s youth receive a superior education but spend less time in the classroom and have little or no homework. Higher education in Slovenia is free.In the wake of the financial meltdown that destroyed Iceland\u2019s economy, the bankers responsible were prosecuted, and prosperity returned. Because the prison system in Norway emphasizes rehabilitation instead of punishment, prisoners are housed in modest but comfortable rooms. As hyperbolic and simplistic as it often sounds, \u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d offers hope and is Mr. Moore\u2019s most far-reaching film.Advertisement"}

American officials did not inform their Chinese counterparts as they planned the provocative maneuver, saying that to do so would have undercut their message.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to consult with any nation when you are exercising the right of freedom of navigation in international waters,\u201d John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said at a news conference.Mr. Kirby said that such a challenge to what he called a questionable sovereignty claim was \u201cone of the reasons you have a navy \u2014 to be able to exert influence and defend freedom of navigation on international waters.\u201dChina has been reclaiming land in the South China and East China Seas for several years, and the projects in the vicinity of the Spratlys have come under increasing criticism from the United States and its regional allies, including the Philippines. The United States and several Asian nations dispute the legitimacy of the islands built by China.As news of the American maneuver circulated in Beijing, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged the United States to \u201cthink twice before taking any reckless action,\u201d China\u2019s national broadcaster, CCTV, reported.The Obama administration did not make an immediate announcement of the maneuver, and Pentagon officials would only confirm that it had occurred, as they forecast weeks ago.\u201cThat certainly includes the ability of our Navy to operate in international waters,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThis is a critically important principle, particularly in the South China Sea, because there are billions of dollars of commerce that flow through that region of the world every year \u2014 maybe even more than that \u2014 and ensuring the free flow of this commerce, and that freedom of navigation of those vessels is protected, is critically important to the global economy.\u201dAmerican officials had said for the last month that the Navy would send a surface ship into the waters claimed by China, a vow widely viewed as a signal to the Chinese that most of the rest of the world does not recognize its claim on the island chain. Mr. Obama approved the move this month, administration officials said.The president signaled the Navy maneuver last month at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, when he said that the United States had an \u201cinterest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force.\u201dBut American military officials said that the two maneuvers were not comparable, citing international maritime laws that allow passage such as the Chinese transit near Alaska if there is no other passageway for a ship to reach its destination.In the case of the Spratly Islands, one American military official said, there were several other routes that the United States destroyer could have used, but the military deliberately chose to enter the waters that China claims as its territory.In recent years, China has been claiming large parts of the strategic waterway by enlarging rocks and submerged reefs into islands big enough for military airstrips, radar equipment and lodging for soldiers, American officials said.Although China claims much of the South China Sea as sovereign territory, the 12-mile zone around the new islands is particularly delicate because international law says that artificial islands do not have sovereign rights up to the 12-mile limit.Jane Perlez contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should the Ban on U.S. Oil Exports Be Lifted?", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Swapping the oil export ban for renewable energy tax credits, as your editorial suggests, is righting one wrong by replacing it with another. Lifting the outdated ban on oil exports would bolster future American oil production, creating jobs and keeping gasoline prices low in the process.But swapping the ban for subsidies like the wind and solar energy tax credits is a grave mistake. These handouts wallop Americans twice: They cost taxpayers billions of dollars and raise electricity prices by propping up expensive sources.My organization has called on Congress to reject any deal that trades lifting the oil export ban for extending handouts to the renewable industry. Lifting the export ban puts American producers on a level playing field with the rest of the world, while ending energy subsidies forces wind and solar companies to stand on their own merits.THOMAS PYLEWashingtonTo the Editor:Although lifting the crude oil export ban would be a boon for the oil industry, it would be a blow to America\u2019s wild places, the world\u2019s climate, American jobs and our pocketbooks.Lifting the ban would mean more drilling and put wild and vulnerable environments like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Atlantic coast at risk. A change of this magnitude would also mean more oil trains running through our neighborhoods and more pipelines bound to spill into our waterways.The science overwhelmingly says that in order to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we must leave dirty fuels in the ground. Lifting the ban will increase the cost of oil, leading to more drilling, further worsening climate disruption.It\u2019s no secret that Big Oil values dollars more than it does people. Lifting the ban would allow the oil industry to export American jobs and raise prices at the pump.Rather than using misinformation to betray our environment, our jobs and our wallets, Congress should listen to President Obama\u2019s advice and focus its efforts on freeing our economy from carbon-based fuels. But linking a bad idea, like lifting the export ban, to a good one, like extending tax credits for clean energy, does not make sense.MICHAEL BRUNEExecutive Director, Sierra ClubSan FranciscoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting for the Right to Sell a Smoothie on New York Streets", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a cloudy morning in late September, a procession of 100 or so street vendors, along with their advocates and a marching band, streamed down Broadway past City Hall, wearing bright yellow T-shirts bearing the words \u201cVendor Power!\u201d On their way to Zuccotti Park, where a halal vendor named Waleed would provide free lunch, the motley group held signs in English, Spanish and Chinese: \u201cVendors Feed New York City,\u201d \u201cMore Permits, Less Tickets,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Criminalize Vending.\u201dBobbing amid this boisterous mass was a large inflated doughnut with sprinkles, as well as a long string on which hung pink slips \u2014 actual vending violations \u2014 dancing in the breeze like car dealership pennants. The demonstrators chanted in Spanish: \u201cQu\u00e9 queremos? Permisos! Cu\u00e1ndo? Ahora!\u201d Then English: \u201cWhat do we want? Permits! When? Now!\u201dThe conflict between vendors and brick-and-mortar businesses in New York dates far beyond 1983, originating in the late 19th century following the emergence of the Lower East Side pushcart peddlers. But several factors have thrust the vendors\u2019 campaign to the forefront today.\u201cFor 12 years, we were struggling with an administration that wouldn\u2019t even listen,\u201d Mr. Basinski said. \u201cWe never got called back.\u201dHe has high hopes for the new leadership, in light of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s stated concern for inequality and low-income workers; the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a fellow Democrat, has also been supportive of Mr. Basinski\u2019s campaign, as have many council members. But he and the 1,800 vendors he represents are losing patience.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting 529 days,\u201d he announced through a megaphone to the crowd at the start of the rally near City Hall. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bill, City Council?\u201d A reply of sorts came soon, when Councilman Carlos Menchaca, Democrat of Brooklyn, took the megaphone. \u201cI hear your voice,\u201d he said in both Spanish and English. He assured the crowd that he and his colleagues were creating a bill. But when it will be proposed or what it will look like is anyone\u2019s guess \u2014 in part because the vendors are not the only interested party.The most prominent opponents are business improvement districts, organizations made up of business and property owners, which oversee the maintenance and development of commercial zones.\u201cRaising the cap is madness,\u201d said Dan Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership and the Bryant Park Management Corporation. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense, because it would worsen the problem by putting more carts out on the street in the same terrible program.\u201dHis list of grievances about the vendors in his districts includes litter; sidewalk congestion; large, unsightly carts; noise from generators; unfair competition with brick-and-mortar businesses. He advocates reducing the number of permits and tightening regulations to limit carts. \u201cOne per block,\u201d Mr. Biederman said. \u201cMaybe.\u201dMr. Basinski wants a substantial increase in the number of permits available, which would mostly serve those already vending. (It is not clear how many food vendors there are, but Mr. Basinski estimates there are more than 10,000.)For the past three years, Ms. Castillo, a 38-year-old from Mexico with two children, sold fruit in the Financial District without a permit. For the first two years, she said, she received tickets about once a month, paying $50 to $100 per violation. Last year, a police officer issued her a ticket for $1,000, the maximum fine for vending without a permit.\u201cAfter that, I couldn\u2019t continue working because I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d she said in Spanish, adding that she had turned down an offer to rent a permit.Also at the rally was Mohamed Attia, a 27-year-old Egyptian who sells smoothies in Midtown. He said he paid $6,000 on the black market for a seven-month permit. \u201cOf course it\u2019s illegal, but this is the only way,\u201d he said. When he started vending six years ago, a seasonal permit cost $2,000 on the black market, he said, and a 24-month permit cost $8,000. Vendors who receive a 24-month permit from the city, however, pay only $200 and can renew it indefinitely, even if they no longer vend.Mr. Attia said the financial strain was made worse by the unannounced inspections from health department workers, who can issue citations costing hundreds of dollars. He has been cited for not having a lid on a garbage pail, for being several inches too close to a crosswalk and for leaving his cart unattended while going to the bathroom, for which he received a $1,200 fine that he successfully contested, he said.For five years, he said, he rented his permit from a man who would fly in from Pakistan to visit the health department with him \u2014 an elaborate means of following procedure. But the increasing cost and the shadiness of it all wore on him, and the arrangement became untenable.So nowadays he limits himself to selling at places that don\u2019t require city permits. \u201cBut if things majorly change,\u201d he said, \u201cI will get back into the street food game in a second. It\u2019s what I love to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The group set off a government shutdown in 2013, came within hours of shuttering the Department of Homeland Security last winter, recently pushed Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio to announce his resignation and blocked his preferred replacement.The Freedom Caucus is made up of hard-line Republicans who have banded together to try to force changes in how the House Republican leadership functions.Its members want a greater voice in how legislation comes together and how the House functions, areas traditionally directed by a leadership team of seasoned lawmakers.They have endorsed a candidate for speaker, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, who, while not as conservative as many of them, seems attractive largely because of his willingness to do as they say. Their long list of demands of a new speaker has few legislative goals, and focuses instead on getting more authority by changing the rules of the House.The fury with which they have challenged their own leaders has largely been embraced by their constituents. Those views poured forth in interviews during last week\u2019s congressional recess in five districts represented by members of the Freedom Caucus.\u201cThe activists, the hard-core folks who come to everything, that represent that small percentage of the base \u2014 they are just very excited,\u201d said Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, an original leader of the new right. \u201cThey feel like for the first time something has changed in Washington, D.C.\u201dThe hard-liners come from all over the country, but they are concentrated in more exurban and rural areas in the South and Rocky Mountain West.

Now, they say, that was only a start: Republicans need to purge any career politician who capitulates to the Democrats if the party wants to address issues like the federal debt, the treatment of veterans and abortion.\u201cI think something is needed to shake up the Republican Party,\u201d said Lynda Sprouse, who owns an insulation company. \u201cIt\u2019s typical of all politicians that they get to Washington and they join the old boys\u2019 club.\u201dMr. Brat, 51, who taught at Randolph-Macon College here for almost two decades, campaigned far to Mr. Cantor\u2019s right. He leveraged the debate in Congress over immigration to argue that Mr. Cantor had become captive to the Washington political establishment and had forgotten about his constituents in Virginia\u2019s Seventh Congressional District.The message found ready purchase among voters in the district, which runs from Richmond and its suburbs to the rural reaches of Washington, an expanse that is largely white, deeply Republican and mostly exurban. The area, a cradle of the American Revolution and then of the Civil War, has evolved into a Republican stronghold embedded in a swing state.The uprising that ousted Mr. Cantor was born of anger from voters like Randy Wingfield, 54, who owns a painting contracting business. He said he had written to Mr. Cantor several times asking for help and had not received a reply.Mr. Brat, he said, could not be more different from the man he replaced.\u201cHe\u2019s standing up for what we want here,\u201d Mr. Wingfield said as he walked up to an \u201cOktoBRATfest\u201d fund-raiser for the congressman.And if it required a government debt default or shutdown, it was all right by him.Mr. Brat declined several requests to be interviewed, saying he was too busy.Between constituent events last week, he did attend a rally for Donald J. Trump in Richmond, where he got a shout-out from the stage.\u201cThere\u2019s a guy \u2014 he shows you can do things,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened before, what he did!

Before seeking office in 2014, Mr. Hice, a Southern Baptist minister, had his own show, syndicated on 400 stations, on which listeners heard him weigh in against Islam and homosexuality and for gun rights and traditional Christian values.Constituents say they do not agree with Mr. Hice on everything but trust him to represent them.\u201cHe represents my values,\u201d said Bruce Henry, a Jasper County commissioner. \u201cWe\u2019re a rural community. He\u2019s a Bible-believing man. He believes in the Second Amendment. He\u2019s honest.\u201dAs for the willingness of Mr. Hice and the Freedom Caucus to shut down the government, Mr. Henry said: \u201cI just think we need to be firmer, put our foot down and not do so much deal-making. Sometimes, you have to take it to that point, especially if it was over the funding of Planned Parenthood.\u201dLike Georgia itself, the 10th District was long a Democratic stronghold. \u201cWhen we moved here 40 years ago, the Democratic primary was the election,\u201d said Kathy Mudd, the editor of The Monticello News.At the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Hice stood amid a small herd of stuffed deer and told an approving audience that he was still fighting to block the Iran nuclear deal, cut funding for Planned Parenthood and keep federal spending caps in place.In an interview later, he also said he would not vote to raise the debt ceiling, no matter the economic consequences. \u201cWhere does the insanity stop?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe have got to cut spending and live within our means.\u201dMr. Hice\u2019s positions add up to a larger view of the country he would like to see, which he painted for constituents in Flovilla, Ga., where he met with wounded veterans.\u201cOur constitutional principles, freedom and liberty, respect, tolerance for one another,\u201d Mr. Hice said, \u201cbut where we have a government of the people, for the people, where government is limited in its intrusiveness in our lives, and freedom is able to flourish and businesses are able to do what they do without being suffocated through regulations and taxation \u2014 the America that you and I grew up in.\u201d\u2014 David M.

And with Jay Lawrence, a longtime radio talk show host serving his first term as state representative, who said that he kept his focus on his district and that there was \u201cno point worrying about what happens in Washington.\u201dThey were part of a welcoming crowd for Representative David Schweikert, a member of the Freedom Caucus who has been waging war with his own Republican leadership in the House. Running on his 12th cup of cappuccino, Mr. Schweikert bounded to the front of the room.First elected to Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010, Mr. Schweikert represents a district, the Sixth, that spills from the northern edge of Scottsdale into a clump of conservative suburbs. They include Paradise Valley, which was home to Barry Goldwater, and Fountain Hills, home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio.The questions from his constituents were tinged with hostility, but the animus was not directed at him. \u201cInstead of calling them liberals, progressives, why not call them socialists?\u201d one man asked. How could he \u201cprevent more damage,\u201d another man put it, \u201cuntil Obama leaves office?\u201d\u201cHere in Arizona, there are four of us looking to change the process,\u201d said Mr. Schweikert, 53, referring to three other representatives from Arizona who have joined the Freedom Caucus. \u201cWhen other Republicans come shooting at us,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe need you to back us up.\u201dHe was unsparing in his criticism of House Republican leaders, who, Mr. Schweikert said, suffered from \u201can incredible void of creativity\u201d and exercised their power \u201conly for power\u2019s sake.\u201dThe contest for House speaker \u201cis not about an individual, but about the policies and procedures we live under,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to push and push and push to make sure the House is an institution that does its job well.\u201dLegislation, he said, should stall or advance based on merit. The crowd cheered.Then Mr. Schweikert jauntily said his goodbyes and walked outside.\u201cThat genuflecting thing gets a little old,\u201d he said, quick-stepping across the parking lot to his pickup truck. \u201cWe need a disrupter.\u201d\u2014 Fernanda SantosGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 Tucked away in a local government building, the town-hall-style meeting offered constituents of Representative Justin Amash a chance to share what was on their minds: gratitude.\u201cFirst I want to say thank you for the great job you\u2019re doing, and thank you for helping ease Boehner out of there,\u201d said a man sitting in the first row.Mr. Amash, a Republican easily re-elected last year, soaked in the praise, a welcome departure from the accusations of obstructionism that dog him and others in the Freedom Caucus in Washington.\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019d describe it as \u2018easing him out of there,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut thanks.\u201dMr. Amash represents Michigan\u2019s Third District, which is anchored in the state\u2019s most prosperous metropolitan area, yet many of his constituents fret that Congress is stalled as the Obama administration rolls along unchecked.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t conservative enough,\u201d Mr. Amash said. \u201cIt\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t follow the process.\u201dNot everyone was buying Mr. Amash\u2019s answer. To Robin Daning, 65, a Grand Rapids resident who voted for Mr. Amash in 2010, the grievances sounded slight.\u201cWhat did he really do that\u2019s wrong that hasn\u2019t been done ever since I\u2019ve been alive?\u201d Mr. Daning said of Mr. Boehner. \u201cThe sausage is ugly, and that\u2019s the way it works.\u201dDescribing himself as a former Republican, Mr. Daning acknowledged that he might be in the minority in his frustrations with the Freedom Caucus.\u201cOn my block of 17 houses, I cannot find one person that agrees with what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I come to these meetings, and then I\u2019ll find them. That\u2019s one of the reasons that I come, because I want to look around and say, \u2018Who are these people?\u2019\u201dNearly 85 percent white and encompassing part of southwest Michigan, Mr. Amash\u2019s district has long leaned Republican. The airport is one of many local institutions that bear the name of its most famous former resident, President Gerald R. Ford.While defying tidy characterizations \u2014 Grand Rapids is strongly Democratic, but its suburbs and exurbs are heavily Republican \u2014 constituents at the meeting were unified in the belief that Congress could not get things done.And Dave Zondervan, 71, said he hoped the Freedom Caucus would continue to grow.\u201cWe\u2019d all sail along smoothly if we didn\u2019t have any obstructionists, but then again, where have we gone the last 50 years?\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s time that we do have an obstructionist.\u201d\u2014 Emmarie HuettemanSTEVENSVILLE, Md. \u2014 Representative Andy Harris has the one attribute that matters to Larry Cate. \u201cHe\u2019s a Republican,\u201d Mr. Cate said, unfurling a smile as long as the nearby Chesapeake Bay Bridge.And that was really enough. Mr. Cate did not delve into Mr. Harris\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 revising regulations for temporary work visas, undoing environmental regulations, increasing military spending and keeping residents of the District of Columbia from obtaining marijuana.Mr. Cate, a 49-year-old builder, is satisfied simply to be represented by a Republican in a heavily Democratic state. And in many respects, Mr. Harris has Democrats, who drew his heavily gerrymandered district, to thank for the office that he holds.That is the story of many of the members of the Freedom Caucus who have muscled their way into outsize power in Congress: Their districts have been drawn in such a way as to almost ensure a hard-line conservative winner.Democrats put the state\u2019s most Republican areas in Mr. Harris\u2019s district, which includes the entire Eastern Shore, dominated by seafood, tourism and agriculture, and the working-class and suburban areas that hug the Pennsylvania border. The district, the First, stretches from the elegant boating town of St. Michaels to the hardened suburbs of Baltimore. This made some Democrats safer but gave Mr. Harris a district in which Republicans hold a 14-percentage-point advantage over Democrats among registered voters.But, like many Republicans in heavily Republican districts, Mr. Harris, 58, feels the pressure to move to the right with each primary.\u201cI was pretty conservative before I came to Congress,\u201d said Mr. Harris, a former state senator and an anesthesiologist. \u201cThe current challenger I have is someone being more conservative who criticizes my vote for John Boehner as speaker.\u201dHe added: \u201cI feel strongly that we should go to nonpartisan redistricting. Gerrymandering clearly creates hyperpartisan districts.\u201dMr. Harris insists that he does not want a more conservative nation, simply a greater voice in how bills are put together in Congress.\u201cI think people have misinterpreted what our goal is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe proved it when we endorsed for speaker the most liberal of the three candidates. I personally believe since the House is right of center overall, the result will be right-of-center legislation, but occasionally there will be Democrats who get to offer their ideas, too.\u201d\u2014 Jennifer SteinhauerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Announces Plans to Combat Illegal Fishing and Other Steps to Protect Oceans", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdministration officials also said they intended to expand the use of satellites that track illegal activity by detecting night lights used by fishermen to attract fish, and committed to better track all seafood that enters American ports.Chilean officials said they intended to cordon off more than 200,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean near Easter Island from commercial fishing and oil and gas exploration.Emphasizing the urgency of the crisis, Secretary of State John Kerry told the conference that the sea was acidifying 10 times faster than at any other point in history, and that one-third of the world\u2019s fish stocks were overexploited.\u201cThere\u2019s a direct line between black-market fishing, black-market drugs, smuggling and human trafficking,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cAnd people need to focus in on that intently.\u201dIn interviews last month and on Monday, Mr. Kerry elaborated on the administration\u2019s vision for better protecting the oceans. Pointing out that at least $10 billion is lost globally each year because of illegal fishing, Mr. Kerry said countries had to do more to police their waters. The biggest challenge to protecting the world\u2019s oceans, he said, is not writing new rules or declaring new areas off-limits to commercial activity, but enforcement.As an example, he cited the case of the Thunder, a ship that had topped Interpol\u2019s most-wanted list for more than $60 million worth of illegal fishing.The chase ended in April when the ship sank, possibly on purpose to dispose of evidence, in the waters off the West African island state of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. The ship\u2019s captain and two crew members, who have been detained in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe since the sinking, have been tried for environmental and maritime crimes. A verdict in the case is expected this week.In this series on lawlessness on the high seas, Ian Urbina reveals that crime and violence in international waters often goes unpunished.The Thunder\u2019s prime catch was toothfish, more popularly called Chilean sea bass, known on docks as \u201cwhite gold\u201d because its fillets often sell for $30 a plate or more in upscale restaurants in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re a tiny country with huge waters around us and limited resources,\u201d said Frederique Samba Viegas D\u2019Abreu, the attorney general of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, adding that this case was among the most expensive in his country\u2019s history.In late September, another toothfish vessel that had been wanted by Interpol, chased by Sea Shepherd and detained in Thailand escaped port and disappeared on the high seas. Thai port authorities say they are investigating how the ship got away and what sort of crew was aboard.Mr. Kerry said he hoped to see the House move forward with the measure, which, he said, has been bogged down by questions over whether it would put American fishermen at a disadvantage if the United States were to enforce it while other nations did not.Mr. Stumberg analyzed $300 million worth of American government purchases of fishery products, including frozen shrimp, canned tuna and livestock feed, which he said were most likely to be produced by slave labor. The biggest barrier to determining which federal contracts are most directly tied to sea slaves, he said, is the lack of specificity in the federal database.Mr. Kerry said he hoped to broaden oversight of seafood as it enters American ports to account not just for environmental crimes but labor concerns too. Port or fishery authorities responsible for reviewing imported seafood need to have not only \u201can understanding of the fishing chain, but also some sort of sign off or seal of approval as to what the conditions were in which it was fished,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Oil Giant Selling Assets", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyMOSCOW \u2014 A refinery went to the Chinese. A stake in a Siberian oil field went to BP. And a large regional oil company widely expected to be gobbled up by Rosneft, the Russian state oil giant, remained on the balance of a government agency instead.With a powerful ally of President Vladimir V. Putin at the helm, Rosneft has for more than a decade grown rapaciously inside Russia and abroad, as a company coming to symbolize the wealth and might of Russia during the oil boom.But that changed this year. Rosneft, though still the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company when measured by production, has been unloading assets while struggling to pay down debt.\u201cThe government is really facing tough times,\u201d said Ildar Davletshin, an energy analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.The average price of Ural blend oil, the main Russian export grade, was $97 a barrel last year, but it has averaged just $57 in the first half of this year, and has been selling for even less this fall.Though it is too early to gauge the seriousness of this shift, the effects are already being felt in the oil industry. Mr. Sechin, once an unassailable figure in Russian politics and, like Mr. Putin, a former Soviet intelligence agent, has suffered slights that whittle away at his stature. So far this year, however, there has been only one high-profile, politically hued dismissal of an executive in the industry.Rosneft and the China National Chemical Corporation traded in September a stake in a refinery under construction in the Russian far east for shares in refineries inside China, a deal that transfers to the Chinese the up-front investment in the Russian refinery.\u201cThey have to adjust the old model,\u201d Mr. Davletshin said. \u201cThe old model was based on the large state companies. I doubt Putin will change this in the middle of the crisis. But if they use this model, they have to ensure it works,\u201d and does not drain money from state coffers.In August, the company formally rescinded its request for a bailout from one of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, leaving it few options but to divest itself of assets. Rosneft executives say its strategy is \u201cdeleveraging\u201d the debt taken on in the TNK-BP purchase. About $25 billion of syndicated loan debt to large Western banks, including Barclays and Bank of America, comes due in the next six months.Back in a high oil price environment, BP sold its TNK-BP joint venture here at a price that valued reserves at about $4.50 per barrel. Then this year, it paid about $2 per barrel for its share in the new field. Having sold dear and bought cheap from Rosneft, BP\u2019s president in Russia, David Campbell, said at the signing ceremony in St. Petersburg in June, \u201cI\u2019m pleased we have been able to conclude this transaction.\u201dThere\u2019s no such pleasure being expressed by the Russian government over what senior officials are now openly suggesting is bungled management of the large state enterprises, though Rosneft has not been singled out.The government, said Alexander Abramov, an economist at the Higher School of Economics, is grappling with the problem of its own making of the past decade in forming gigantic, inefficient state monopolies, a hallmark of Mr. Putin\u2019s economic policies.Not surprisingly, waste and inefficiency flourished. Rosneft\u2019s capitalization is now less on the London Stock Exchange, about $38 billion, than the $56 billion the company paid for the TNK-BP subsidiary two years ago.Rosneft, in a statement, drew attention to the company\u2019s exceptionally low production costs from currently pumping fields, and high profit margin. Rosneft\u2019s outlay of $3 per barrel produced is the lowest among major oil companies, for example. \u201cThe company is constantly working on boosting efficiency,\u201d Rosneft said in the statement. Rosneft shares rose slightly this year, while international competitors fell as much as 27 percent, for Shell.Under Mr. Sechin, the company said, reserves grew 40 percent and the company has made a profit for the past 13 consecutive quarters. The longer outlook is less certain.Output is projected to fall by 1.1 percent this year in the start of a long, slow slide not only for Rosneft but the oil industry as a whole, as onshore fields in Siberia are peaking and declining.Before tensions flared in the Ukraine crisis, Rosneft had planned to stabilize output by taking the industry offshore.\u201cWe reached a decision, so as not to lose market share, to correct the business plan toward pumping from already active fields,\u201d Mr. Sechin told Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev at a meeting in August. Mr. Sechin told Mr. Medvedev he would also shake up the leadership of underperforming subsidiaries.Rosneft will pay about $23 billion less in taxes this year compared to last because of the oil price collapse, unseating Rosneft as the country\u2019s largest taxpayer. Gazprom has again assumed that role. Rosneft will be treading water at best to hold its current output volumes. \u201cFlat would be a real good result\u201d for the coming year, Mr. Davletshin said.Advertisement"}

What is happening to the women being left behind by all the men heading to Europe? \u2014 Sara Hobler, Buffalo, N.Y.Many Syrians have strong, extended family networks, and it is common for women whose husbands or sons have left for Europe to get support from other relatives. Those families, too, have lost the incomes of the men who have left or been killed in the war, and they often struggle to make ends meet.\u2014 BEN HUBBARDThere\u2019s no doubt that overall unemployment across the European Union remains stubbornly high at nearly 10 percent. The rate among those with tertiary levels of education is lower: 6.6 percent in the 19 eurozone countries and 5.5 percent across the European Union, according to officials at Eurostat, the bloc\u2019s statistical office.Even so, Mr. Juncker\u2019s assertion does seem to support the views of some economists and migration experts who argue that migration can help drive economic activity, growth and employment in some countries.Providing education and skills will be crucial, those experts say.\u201cRaising immigrants\u2019 employment rate to that of the native-born would entail substantial fiscal gains in many European O.E.C.D. countries, in particular in Belgium, France and Sweden,\u201d the paper said.Few empirical studies have tried, however, to estimate the overall impact of net migration on economic growth, in part because of a shortage of comparative data on international migration by skill levels.Germany, with an overall jobless rate below 5 percent (and a jobless rate of 2.3 percent for those with tertiary education), should be able to integrate new arrivals into its work force as long as those people lacking qualifications and skills receive sufficient training, according to Matthias Busse, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.But the long-term effects on Europe\u2019s economy are less clear because of a range of variables like skills, success at integration and the average age of immigrants and asylum seekers.\u201cYoung migrants will profit from our education system and they still have a full work life to contribute to the welfare state,\u201d Mr. Busse said. He added that \u201cupskilling adult arrivals may also contribute, but the net impact is more difficult to assess.\u201d \u2014 JAMES KANTERQ. For how long is Europe willing to take in refugees, and how many? Is this an open-ended commitment that could last until the population of the Middle East and Africa has migrated to Europe? \u2014 Sandy Belkin, Bellmore, N.Y.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said repeatedly that there is no limit on how many refugees Europe could or should absorb \u2014 at least in theory. But as Ms. Merkel and certainly some of her critics have also said, there is a practical limit to the number of people that can be effectively absorbed over a short period.The entire population of the Middle East or Africa could not emigrate to Europe. But large numbers of people are expected to be on the move as long as the war in Syria persists. And there are other causes of the mass migration we\u2019re witnessing. In August, the United Nations predicted that Africa would add 1.3 billion people by 2050. That is about the current population of China. Economic growth is also predicted for Africa, but it\u2019s uncertain that this growth will be sufficient to support the continent\u2019s inhabitants, forcing many to move elsewhere in search of work.Europe, by contrast, is getting older. Germany is among the European countries with a rapidly aging population, and Ms. Merkel has long noted that Europeans cannot expect to retain their current living standards if the Continent has just 7 percent of the world\u2019s population but accounts for 50 percent of global expenditures on welfare. \u2014 ALISON SMALEAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Reunion, Bernanke and Geithner Revisit the Crisis", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said on Tuesday that stronger regulation had significantly improved the resilience of the financial system.A theoretical replay of the housing bubble would now cause less damage, he said, thanks to changes like reducing banks\u2019 reliance on borrowed money.\u201cWe would have had a minor recession, a housing crash, but we would not have had the financial panic that we had,\u201d he said.The next crisis, of course, is likely to take a different form, but Mr. Bernanke said the changes would still make a difference. \u201cWhatever the shock may come from, I think we\u2019re in better shape to deal with it,\u201d he said.The event reunited the only two people who served as senior government officials throughout the financial crisis: Mr. Bernanke as Fed chairman, and Mr. Geithner, first as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and then as Treasury secretary.Mr. Geithner began by joking that the reunion was in some respects painful.\u201cIt brings back bad memories,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just reading the book but sitting here with you. You were cool to work with, but we had to do some terrible things.\u201dIn fact, the two men collaborated on many of the main elements of the government\u2019s response to the crisis, including the managed failure of Bear Stearns, the unmanaged collapse of Lehman Brothers and the stress tests of major financial institutions that are now regarded as the effective end of the crisis.\u201cI would ultimately become a big fan of Tim\u2019s, but when I first met him I was underwhelmed,\u201d Mr. Bernanke wrote in his book. \u201cHis strengths were my weaknesses, with his patience balancing my impatience,\u201d Mr. Geithner wrote of Mr. Bernanke. \u201cWe would work in almost perfect harmony throughout the crisis. We trusted each other.\u201dOn Tuesday, the two men showed a less formal side. Mr. Bernanke volunteered his opinion that the Treasury should keep Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill. A decision is expected this year.\u201cIf they take him off the $10 bill, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said.He also answered some random questions from the audience.Is the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady a cheater? Mr. Bernanke: \u201cThe judge said no.\u201dIf he could do it all over again, would he choose to be famous? \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cIf you get to choose between being rich or famous, I would vote for rich.\u201dThey also talked about the crisis, of course.In his book, Mr. Bernanke advanced the view that the 2008 crash was basically a modern update of a standard panic, draining money from banks and newer kinds of financial firms. The Fed under Mr. Bernanke therefore responded in the traditional way, by pumping money into the financial system. Mr. Bernanke said it was clear in his judgment that the Fed\u2019s efforts had produced a stronger economic recovery. He noted the impact of the crisis was similar in Europe and the United States, but the Fed responded more quickly and aggressively.He said the Fed\u2019s decision to purchase trillions of dollars in government debt and mortgage bonds, a strategy Europe is now emulating, was a major difference. Mr. Geithner and Mr. Bernanke have both expressed frustration about what they regard as a lack of public understanding that they bailed out financial firms for the benefit of the broader economy.\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a way \u2014 obviously we weren\u2019t that successful doing it \u2014 to make it understandable to people why it\u2019s necessary to provide that level of protection?\u201d Mr. Geithner asked on Tuesday. \u201cOn its face it looks like it\u2019s an immoral thing and an unjust thing to do.\u201dMr. Bernanke, in response, said some of the anger directed at the government was justified because regulators failed to prevent the crisis.\u201cThe first thing is, you need to do everything you can in advance\u201d to prevent a crisis, he said. \u201cSome of the anger was, I think, justified because the regulators did not prevent the panic in the first place.\u201dHe added that he hoped people would come to understand and appreciate the government\u2019s actions. That is, after all, one reason the two men wrote books.That goal, however, remains elusive.As the event ended, a handful of demonstrators shouted at the men for rescuing Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dollar\u2019s Surge Against Other Currencies Weighs Down United States\u2019 Economy", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since the American dollar began to surge against foreign currencies late last year, economists have warned that the repercussions would eventually be felt on the home front.If there were any doubts about that, they were resolved last week.With Friday\u2019s Labor Department report showing slower hiring than expected in September, and the weaker data on exports and factory activity released earlier in the week, evidence of the effects of the dollar\u2019s rise on the domestic economy is piling up.\u201cThere is no question about it: The dollar is clearly having an impact,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy.Indeed, while Mr. Behravesh estimates that domestic consumption rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter \u2014 a healthy pace by most measures \u2014 he expects economic growth for the period to come in at around 2 percent.That\u2019s a significant gap, Mr. Behravesh said, with most of it due to the strengthening dollar, which makes American goods more expensive abroad, as well as slower growth overseas in important export markets like China and Brazil.Other experts are even more pessimistic about the economy\u2019s growth rate in July, August and September, with Macroeconomic Advisers cutting its estimate to 1.4 percent on Friday, down from 2.4 percent at the start of the week.Goldman Sachs expects the drag from trade on output to persist through the end of 2016, reducing the American economy\u2019s overall growth rate by nearly a full percentage point.Although the dollar dipped after the release of Friday\u2019s anemic jobs report, few experts expect that weakness to persist. In fact, the dollar could eventually move a bit higher from current levels, depending on when the Fed finally makes its long-expected move to raise rates.A stronger dollar not only makes American-made products more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas, but it also favors foreign manufacturers, since they can afford to sell their goods for less in the United States than domestic producers.That is one reason there is nervousness on Wall Street with many big American companies reporting earnings for the third quarter in the coming weeks, starting with Alcoa on Thursday.Still, as with most trends in the economy, this one cuts both ways, with benefits as well as costs.Chief among the benefits are lower prices in the United States, especially for energy and consumer products, which has the effect of keeping inflation at bay.Although inflation, if anything, has tended to be too low rather than too high since the current recovery began six years ago, Federal Reserve policy makers are keeping a very close eye on prices in order to determine when to finally raise short-term interest rates from near zero.With import prices under pressure, the stronger dollar \u201cis essentially doing the Fed\u2019s work for them in terms of keeping inflation in check,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.To put it another way, the Fed has more leeway to leave rates near zero into early 2016. That would allow the labor market to recover more fully and average hourly earnings to potentially rise.But the dollar\u2019s advance may not be over.Although most of the dollar\u2019s rise against major currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, with exchange rates stabilizing more recently, emerging market currencies have continued to deteriorate in recent months.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Already, the drop in emerging market currencies is resulting in an uptick of goods arriving on American shores from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, said Jon W. Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country\u2019s second-busiest port after the Los Angeles port.Over all, the trade deficit in the United States is running about $10 billion more than last year, and a sharp widening for August is expected when the government reports the latest data on Tuesday.While much of the jump in imports is coming from consumer goods, which tend to be made overseas, American factories are being hurt as demand for equipment and other heavier goods from overseas ebbs.Manufacturers shed 27,000 jobs in August and September, a significant reversal from the gains recorded from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014, when factory employment jumped by more than 300,000.\u201cIt takes a while for the dollar to work its way through the economy, but it\u2019s weighing on manufacturing,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.Mr. Gapen said the dollar\u2019s surge \u2014 and its ripple effects on the domestic economy in the United States \u2014 were major factors in his firm\u2019s decision to move its forecast of the first Fed rate increase from December 2015 to March 2016.\u201cSome Fed policy makers are definitely looking at this, and they know that trade will be a big drag on growth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the dollar\u2019s strength is showing up in the numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Pacific Trade Negotiators Haggle, U.S. Officials Remain Hopeful", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations neared agreement on Sunday night on the largest regional trade accord in history, a potentially precedent-setting model for global commerce and worker standards that would tie together 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy, from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia.Final haggling over the arcane details of opening dairy markets to competition delayed the announcement that trade ministers promised for Sunday. But United States government officials said they were confident that a deal was imminent after nearly eight years of negotiations \u2014 including five days of round-the-clock sessions here \u2014 and negotiators from other countries echoed that confidence.Trade ministers, eager to depart after repeatedly canceling flights, tentatively planned to announce their accord Monday. If it comes together, the Trans-Pacific Partnership still faces months of debate in Congress and will inject a new flash point into both parties\u2019 presidential contests. An accord would be a potentially legacy-making achievement for President Obama, and the capstone for his foreign policy \u201cpivot\u201d toward closer relations with fast-growing eastern Asia, after years of American preoccupation with the Middle East and North Africa.Mr. Obama spent recent days contacting world leaders to seal the deal. To members of Congress, administration officials have repeatedly pressed their contention that the partnership will build a bulwark against China\u2019s economic influence, and allow the United States and its allies \u2014 not Beijing \u2014 to set the standards for Pacific commerce.The Pacific accord would phase out thousands of import tariffs as well as other barriers to international trade. It also would establish uniform rules on corporations\u2019 intellectual property, open the Internet even in communist Vietnam, and crack down on wildlife trafficking and environmental abuses.Several potentially deal-breaking disputes besides the dairy details kept the ministers talking through the weekend, and forced the repeated delays of a celebratory announcement. Final compromises covered commercial protections for drug makers\u2019 advanced medicines, liberalized trade in sugar and a slow phaseout \u2014 over two to three decades \u2014 of the tariffs on Japan\u2019s autos sold in North America.The negotiators had postponed action on ending tariffs and opening the participating countries to each other\u2019s dairy exports until the pharmaceutical drug issue was resolved. But they miscalculated how long it would take to settle questions involving the politically powerful dairy industries in Canada, New Zealand, the United States and other countries. For officials from Canada, which holds federal elections within two weeks, the issue is particularly sensitive. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been under pressure because of an economic slowdown mainly caused by the collapse of oil and other commodity prices, and he has promoted the agreement as a way to boost Canadian exports.But dairy interests there oppose opening markets to foreign competitors.The parties to the accord also include Mexico, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.In a concession likely to be problematic with key Republicans, the United States agreed that brand-name pharmaceutical companies would have a period shorter than the current 12 years to keep secret their data on producing so-called biologics, which are advanced medicines made from living organisms. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade, has threatened to withdraw his support for the accord if United States negotiators agree to loosening pharmaceutical industry protections from those in federal law.But arrayed against the United States, which said the protection was a necessary incentive for drug makers to innovate, were virtually every other country at the table, led by Australia. The generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups also strenuously opposed the United States position, pressing for access within five years to the data to speed lower-priced \u201cbiosimilars\u201d to market. The compromise is a hybrid that protects companies\u2019 data for five years to eight years.Only once that intellectual property issue was settled did several nations including Canada, New Zealand and the United States turn to the dairy issues.The trade ministers have settled much, especially in recent months, and those agreements \u2014 filling 30 separate chapters \u2014 are what kept the negotiators from giving up in recent days on reaching a conclusion.Labor unions are poised to argue that the emerging agreement favors Big Business over workers and environmental protection. Donald Trump has castigated the Pacific trade accord repeatedly as \u201ca bad deal,\u201d injecting conservative populism into the debate and emboldening some congressional Republicans protective of their local interests like sugar and rice industries and opposed to Mr. Obama at every turn.The agreement for the first time would require state-owned businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards. Administration officials say the labor and environmental commitments are the strongest ever in a trade agreement, and a model for future pacts, although some environmental groups and most unions are unpersuaded.The worker standards commit all parties to the International Labor Organization\u2019s principles for collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces and against child labor, forced labor and excessive hours.Unions and human rights groups, however, are skeptical that Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei will improve labor conditions, or that Malaysia will stop human trafficking of poor workers from Myanmar and Southeast Asia. The United States reached separate agreements with the three nations on enforcing labor standards, which would allow United States tariffs to be restored if a nation is found in violation after a dispute-settlement process.For the first time in a trade agreement there would be provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to deal with trade barriers and red tape.The agreement also would overhaul special tribunals that handle trade disputes between businesses and participating nations. The changes would respond to widespread criticisms that the Investor-State Dispute Settlement panels favor businesses and interfere with nations\u2019 efforts to pass rules safeguarding public health.Even if an agreement is reached, Mr. Obama cannot sign the accord until Congress has 90 days to review the pact\u2019s details.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Considers Plan to Help Puerto Rico ", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials in the Treasury Department are discussing a radical and aggressive response to the fiscal chaos engulfing Puerto Rico that could involve a broad debt exchange assisted by the federal government.The proposal calls for the federal government to help Puerto Rico collect and account for local tax revenues from the island\u2019s businesses and residents, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the proposal. An inability to collect all the taxes owed is widely seen as contributing to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis.The tax proceeds would be placed in a \u201clockbox\u201d overseen by the Treasury and eventually paid out by the Treasury to the holders of the new bonds that Puerto Rico would issue in the proposed exchange. Since the Treasury would effectively become the paying agent for the new bonds, they would be more attractive than the bonds that creditors now hold. That would make it easier for Puerto Rico to exchange the new debt with creditors who hold bonds that have been devastated in value since the island warned this summer that it could not pay its debts.The proposal has logistical, political and legal challenges, however, and may never get off the ground.\u201cRight now, Puerto Ricans don\u2019t even like to pay taxes to their own government,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the discussions. If the I.R.S. were to suddenly replace the local tax authorities and try to gather up the money for debt service, \u201cpeople would say, \u2018Go to hell. I\u2019m not paying the U.S. government.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBut the fact that such an unusual idea has been floated between the Treasury and top finance officials from Puerto Rico in recent months suggests a sharp shift in Washington\u2019s approach to the island\u2019s economic crisis.Without addressing the proposal directly, officials from the Treasury said in a statement that it had \u201cno plans to provide a bailout to Puerto Rico.\u201dUntil now, the Treasury has provided mostly technical assistance to island officials, while the Republican leaders in Congress have expressed strong reservations about bailing out Puerto Rico. The island\u2019s first choice appears to be a bankruptcy law amendment that would allow the island to send some of its governmental bodies into Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy court. But bills introduced to that effect have not moved.The current proposal, which has been called a \u201cglobal exchange vehicle\u201d by some, and \u201csuperbond\u201d by others, appears to have been developed as a backup plan, in case the Republican lawmakers do not change their minds. The idea would not involve the federal government issuing debt, or even guaranteeing debt, on Puerto Rico\u2019s behalf.Rather, Treasury would help safeguard Puerto Rico\u2019s tax proceeds to reassure creditors that they would not be used for any purposes other than to pay off debt. That safeguard, in theory, should lower the default risk and allow Puerto Rico to borrow at lower interest rates.For the last year, Puerto Rico has been virtually shut out of the debt markets because potential investors see the island as highly risky and expect to be compensated for bearing that risk with exceptionally high interest rates.Puerto Rican officials have been warning that the island is likely to exhaust its cash in November, and a debt payment of almost $300 million is due on Dec. 1. They have also been saying they would soon lay out their initial proposal for a debt exchange, but so far a large number of creditors \u2014 particularly those with bad memories of Detroit\u2019s grueling bankruptcy case \u2014 have declined to sign the mandatory confidentiality agreements.\u201cYeah, we heard the \u2018superbond\u2019 piece, we heard that Treasury might be involved, but we have this fundamental issue,\u201d said the person with knowledge of the discussions. \u201cIs this a real deal, or is it just designed to fail?\u201dThat person believed that a deal of this type would raise complex legal questions about whether Treasury\u2019s involvement changed the priority of the creditors. Those that felt they had lost their places at the front of the line might sue, and their lawsuits might prompt others to pile on. A hornets\u2019 nest of litigation might ultimately even persuade the Republicans in Congress to give Puerto Rico the amended bankruptcy law that it wants, that person said, adding, \u201cWe know they want to do a grand and sweeping deal, and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re negotiating in good faith or they\u2019re just setting us up.\u201dThe mayors who dominate the tax body\u2019s governing board say the bank\u2019s cash-flow records are opaque and they do not know what will happen to the money if the bank gets it. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, told Puerto Rican officials in a recent hearing that it would be hard to give them federal assistance unless they opened their financial records to scrutiny.Creditors\u2019 concerns about inadequate tax collection and fiscal transparency have been a focal point in their early talks with Puerto Rico\u2019s investment bankers about a possible debt exchange, said one person briefed on the discussions.The logistics of sending federal tax collectors or contractors to Puerto Rico would be difficult. The idea also presents legal problems. Holders of the island\u2019s general-obligation bonds, for example, currently have an explicit constitutional promise of having the first claim on \u201cavailable resources\u201d to pay their bonds. They would most likely challenge any move that would lay claim to tax revenues and send them somewhere else, such as the United States Treasury.Holders of lower-priority bonds might like the idea of a federal role, however. The idea of a state-led revenue \u201cintercept\u201d is not uncommon in cases where severely distressed cities or school districts have shown signs of defaulting on their bonds. In Puerto Rico\u2019s case, the Treasury would be stepping into the role that is normally played by the state.It is unclear whether a Treasury-assisted debt exchange would apply to all of the island\u2019s $72 billion debt. The lockbox could be used to assure payment of just a portion of the new bonds, for example, as a way of helping reluctant creditors to the table as part of a broader exchange.Advertisement"}

Christie, Time to Go Home", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt\u2019s that time in the ever-long presidential campaign when candidates lacking money and mojo are starting to go back to their plows. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey should join them.The point is that New Jersey is in trouble, and the governor is off pursuing a presidential run that\u2019s turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project. Mr. Christie\u2019s numbers are in the basement, and he\u2019s nearly out of campaign cash. This is his moment, all right: to go home and use the rest of his term to clean out the barn, as Speaker John Boehner would say.Mr. Christie emerged as a national politician because his constituents saw him as a leader who put New Jersey first. His state battered by Hurricane Sandy and his party riven by the Tea Party, he sought needed federal assistance, and if that meant embracing a Democratic president, so what. \u201cSo what?\u201d was a positive Christie characteristic back then. One could disagree with his methods, but he managed to make his efforts on behalf of his state seem sincere.It must have been rough for those who re-elected him to see him hold forth Wednesday in a debate that centered on the national economy, when he\u2019s been a net failure on the New Jersey economy. On his watch, one of the per-capita richest states in the nation has become one of its biggest laggards in economic growth, its budget woes prompting an appalling series of credit downgrades. Mr. Christie\u2019s promises, from fixing the state\u2019s pensions shortfall to its infrastructure, have come to less than nothing. More galling still is that he was not the only such politician on the dais.

{"Headline": "Oil Exports Should Be Paired With Clean Energy Tax Breaks", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe oil industry and its friends in Congress, mostly Republicans, want to get rid of restrictions on exports of crude oil that were established 40 years ago during the energy crisis. President Obama and most Democratic lawmakers are rightly opposed to such measures, at least in their current form.Companies that produce oil argue that removing export restrictions would boost the economy and provide foreign allies with another source of oil, so they would rely less on Russia and the Middle East. But companies that refine oil are worried that making it easier to sell American oil abroad would increase overall demand, raise the price they pay for crude and hurt their profits.The environmental community vigorously asserts that allowing more exports would increase oil production, open sensitive offshore waters to drilling and increase the carbon emissions responsible for climate change.These measures could include long-term extensions of tax credits for renewable fuels like wind and solar power, which are set to expire next year. And any such bill would have to put a stop, once and for all, to some of the billions of dollars of lucrative and wholly unnecessary tax breaks that the oil and gas industry has enjoyed for years.Republicans as a whole care little about climate change and have a deep aversion to compromising with Mr. Obama. Perhaps on this issue they can remove their blinders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slide in Manufacturing Continued in China Last Month", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s sprawling manufacturing sector continued to shrink in September, data released on Thursday showed, despite strength in service industries.Yet some economists said that because of unprecedented government spending, monetary stimulus and a growing services sector, China\u2019s economy as a whole might be more resilient than it seems at first glance.\u201cAll this talk about this impending crisis just seems so far off the mark, when you look at these indicators,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist following China at Capital Economics.Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets were closed on Thursday for a holiday, but other Asia markets were up. And that momentum carried over to European stocks, which opened strongly higher \u2014 despite new manufacturing data indicating only slow growth in the eurozone and signs of a potential slowdown in Britain. By mid-afternoon in Europe, though, stocks indexes were flat or only slight up for the day.For China, manufacturing output, as measured by the official purchasing managers index, was 49.8 in September, compared with a reading of 49.7 in August. The official nonmanufacturing survey result was 53.4, unchanged from August. The survey measures the change in conditions from the previous month; readings below 50 signal contraction.The results of another survey, compiled by Caixin, a Chinese financial news company, and Markit, an economic data provider, suggested a worse picture. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index, also released on Thursday, was 47.2 in September, down slightly from 47.3 in August and the lowest reading since the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009.China\u2019s economic growth has been battered in recent months by a fall in housing construction. That has led to a huge surplus in materials like steel and cement, which has idled plants or caused them to operate at a loss.\u201cThe industry has reached a crucial stage in its structural transformation,\u201d He Fan, the chief economist at the Caixin Insight Group, said in a news release accompanying the data. \u201cTepid demand is a main factor behind the oversupply of manufacturing and why it has not recovered.\u201dAt the same time, lackluster demand in crucial export markets in Asia and the West, and broader slumps in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Turkey, have weighed further on China\u2019s economy.On Monday, official figures showed profits at China\u2019s larger industrial companies fell 8.8 percent in August, compared with a year earlier, the biggest drop since the state statistics agency began releasing monthly data in 2011. Profit fell 22 percent at automakers and 72 percent at oil and natural gas companies.The statistics agency said that industrial profits had been reduced by China\u2019s surprise decision on Aug. 11 to devalue its currency, the renminbi, by the most in nearly two decades.That could benefit exporters, making China\u2019s goods relatively cheaper for overseas buyers. But it also makes imported materials more expensive for Chinese industries. The subindex for new export orders edged up 0.2 to 47.9, but activity was still shrinking over all.European manufacturers, which count on China as a big export market, are generally holding steady at low-level growth, according to the purchasing managers index published on Thursday by Markit. With some variations among the 19 eurozone countries, the overall index remained at 52 \u2014 still slightly in the growth range.But manufacturing activity in Britain, which has been Europe\u2019s fastest-growing economy, dipped to a three-month low, according to Markit, registering a 51.5 reading for September, compared with 51.6 the previous month.In China\u2019s case, although questions about the country\u2019s economic data are not new, many economists now doubt that the country will be able to reach its official target for economic growth of 7 percent this year. Official data did, however, show that rate being achieved in the first six months of the year.Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said there were reasons to hope for a better outlook, especially if the government eased monetary policy again this year. Mr. Liu said he expected growth in gross domestic product to improve slightly toward the end of the year, despite the gloomy manufacturing data.\u201cThe authorities will definitely miss a 7 percent growth, but we may not miss that target by a great margin,\u201d he said.Officials had hoped that consumer demand and the rise of a vibrant services sector would help offset the industrial slowdown and become the economy\u2019s main engines of growth.Both purchasing managers index surveys released on Thursday showed that the services sector continued to expand in September, but that growth, too, faced pressures. The Caixin services purchasing managers index reading, released alongside official data, was 50.5, down from 51.5 in August and at a 14-month low.\u201cIf you look at manufacturing sectors associated with consumption and services, their profitability remains quite healthy,\u201d Mr. Liu said.He pointed to profits in the food processing, education and recreation industries as evidence that services were strong, though not enough to counter the weakness in manufacturing.Mr. Evans-Pritchard agreed that the services figures were a sign of resilience in the economy.\u201cPeople have been talking about the need to rebalance towards consumption. There\u2019s a tendency to focus on industry data, but it is worth mentioning that those are no longer the key driver,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the growth is coming from consumption.\u201dMarkit\u2019s eurozone purchasing managers index, also released on Thursday, showed manufacturing slowing its pace of expansion. The index for September was 52, below the 52.3 reading in August. It has been above 50 for more than two years.Advertisement"}

This is a city that\u2019s reinventing itself with every refresh of your Twitter feed, with cranes rising all over downtown and an army of young tech workers pouring into neighborhoods across the city. In the \u201960s, San Francisco was synonymous with the hippie counterculture; in the \u201990s, it was the dot-com boom (and eventual bust, in the early 2000s); more recently, it was the ripening of the Bay Area food movement. Now it\u2019s home to such new-establishment icons of the digital economy as Airbnb, Uber and, yes, Twitter. But don\u2019t be fooled by the shiny patina: San Francisco is more than just the physical headquarters of our virtual world. There are some things that haven\u2019t changed, and by themselves, are reason enough to revisit: the mind-boggling views along that glorious waterfront; the Mission\u2019s still-feisty, freaky, welcome-all-comers character; the meandering natural pleasures of Golden Gate Park. Even when classic San Francisco rubs up against new San Francisco, the friction, though at times contentious (Google bus protests, the anti-eviction fight), is also where the community-conscious activist roots of this city are as vital and visible as ever.1. City by the Bay | 4 p.m.Make time for a stroll along the Embarcadero, San Francisco\u2019s quintessential bayside pedestrian promenade. Your starting point is just south of the Bay Bridge, at Red\u2019s Java House on Pier 30. A no-frills waterfront dive the San Francisco Chronicle once called \u201cthe Chartres Cathedral of cheap eats,\u201d Red\u2019s has been around in some form or another since 1912, when longshoremen came for the cheeseburger-and-beer breakfast special. Nowadays, it\u2019s a favorite stop for Giants fans on their way to a ballgame at AT&T Park, home to the 2010, 2012 and 2014 World Series champs. Join the cheerfully egalitarian crowd for a sourdough cheeseburger ($5.52) and a beer on the outdoor patio \u2014 it has a view that goes for miles.2. To Market | 5:30 p.m.It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been 12 years since the century-plus-old Ferry Building reopened as a grand marketplace and European-style food hall, after decades of blight and decay in the shadow of the former Embarcadero Freeway (which was taken down after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake). Though the Ferry Building has come to represent all the modern trends in the Bay Area food world, it hews to tradition with a thrice-weekly outdoor farmers\u2019 market, plus indoor food stalls in former ferry berths; the butcher, the baker and the cheesemonger are all on hand to talk to you. Just browsing is a pleasure: It\u2019s all eye candy, from the ceramics to the chocolate. And whatever your age, watching the ferries come and go never gets old.3. Two Piers | 7 p.m.Charles Phan, of Slanted Door fame, has shifted gears with Hard Water, a tiny, New Orleans-inflected whiskey bar and restaurant that opened in 2013 on Pier 3. The kitchen turns out a mean fried chicken \u2014 the better to soak up the powerful cocktails. Whiskey flights start at $22, and are a gentle intro to a deep list. For a heartier meal, head two piers over to Michael Chiarello\u2019s Spanish-meets-California Coqueta, where the extraordinary paella \u2014 bomba rice with clams, shrimp, chorizo and broccolini in fragrant broth made from shellfish and jam\u00f3n serrano, $45 \u2014 is enough to feed three.4. Nightcaps | 9 p.m.A bar in the Mission is an appropriate place to end the night. At the divey, atmospheric Royal Cuckoo, great cocktails are the rule \u2014 try the Carnival Mule, with cacha\u00e7a, ginger beer, Domaine de Canton, tangerine and lime \u2014 as is live music Wednesday through Sunday nights showcasing the house\u2019s old-fashioned Hammond organ. Outdoor drinking is an option at Zeitgeist, a punk-spirited biergarten and neighborhood institution; its native population is heavy on the bikers and bike messengers. Don\u2019t take selfies, or management might boot you out \u2014 service is gruff, and proud of it.5. Break Bread | 10 a.m.Along 24th Street in the Mission, Mexican bakeries are still where mornings begin. For just a dollar or two, pick up sugar-dusted pan dulce or custard-filled pastries with your coffee at La Mejor Bakery or Panaderia La Mexicana, and watch the neighborhood wake up. Then head south for a climb up over windswept Bernal Hill to the sprawling Alemany Farmers\u2019 Market, said to be the oldest in the state of California, improbably situated near where Interstate 280 crosses Highway 101. The weekly market still offers the best cornucopia in the city: The greens alone regularly range from Chinese long beans, pea shoots and bok choy to dandelion, kale and mustard greens (about $5 for three bunches). Can\u2019t fix what ain\u2019t broke.6. Picnic in the Park | 12 p.m.Bring your provisions for a picnic at the newly spiffed-up Dolores Park, where an $8 million renovation made over the northern half of the park with new tennis courts; six acres of fresh, grassy splendor; and expanded restrooms (this last is critical to a comfortable afternoon). The other half of the park will get similar treatment in the coming year. What hasn\u2019t changed: the diverse crush of humanity, and the excellent vistas of the San Francisco skyline.7. The People\u2019s Art | 1:30 p.m.Take stock of the Mission\u2019s murals with Precita Eyes, a neighborhood arts organization that has been sponsoring local and international mural projects and offering classes for nearly four decades. Docents lead weekly mural walks ($20, with discounts for students and seniors) through alleys and streets dense with color, and add stories and context to ever-shifting images that comment on everything from human rights to Hurricane Katrina.8. Two Ways to Taste | 7 p.m.Put yourself in the expert hands of some of the Mission\u2019s best neighborhood chefs. At Ichi Sushi & Ni Bar\u2019s airy new space, request a seat at the bar for omakase, or chef\u2019s choice, and be entertained by the jewel-toned march of seafood across your plate \u2014 perhaps wild salmon, sweet shrimp heads and lightly seared saba (about $65 for 12 pieces). Or try the three-course menu and wine pairing at Heirloom Cafe ($65), an elegant neighborhood spot that might smartly present a bavette steak and maitake mushrooms with a malbec. At both establishments, fresh, simple dishes and friendly service are standouts, and the price is right.9. One for the Team | 9 p.m.Bring friends for a game or two at the Mission Bowling Club, the city\u2019s first new bowling alley in 40 years when it opened in 2012. The owners, Sommer Peterson and Molly Bradshaw, wanted to conjure the intimate, friendly neighborhood alley of their youth \u2014 but with really good food (and sans fluorescent lighting). They\u2019ve succeeded. Two of the six lanes are held for drop-ins most nights, but you\u2019ll probably want to make a reservation (reservations can be made a week ahead, $35 to $55 per lane per hour).10. Bookworms Welcome | 10 a.m.First there was Green Apple Books: Opened in 1967, it\u2019s a literary institution. Now there\u2019s Green Apple Books on the Park, perfectly situated for a morning browse along the Inner Sunset\u2019s Ninth Avenue, just south of Golden Gate Park. Don\u2019t be fooled by the narrow storefront \u2014 the shop reaches far into the interior space, and is big enough to be anchored by a dedicated children\u2019s area. Like its sister store, it also hosts events featuring an impressive lineup of writers, including such recent guests as Karl Ove Knausgaard, Maggie Nelson, Aleksandar Hemon and Molly Antopol. Afterward, stroll down the street and into Urban Bazaar to browse fair-trade and quirky, locally made gifts \u2014 belts made from old bike tires, screen-printed owl tea towels \u2014 and admire the boutique\u2019s charming little air plant and succulent nursery.11. Seasonal Tastes | 11:30 a.m.For a leisurely brunch, head to the sun-warmed back patio of Nopalito, a branch of Divisadero\u2019s beloved Nopa, for brightly flavored, vibrant Mexican: squash-blossom quesadilla, pork-shoulder pozole, and peach, avocado and lettuce salad with pumpkin seeds and cotija cheese (brunch for two about $45). Or for on-the-go noshing, stop at the worker-owned-and--run Arizmendi Bakery for the excellent daily pizza: always vegetarian, always changing, always available by the slice ($2.50, and it comes with a little bonus sliver) or pie.12. In Residence | 1 p.m.Every month, the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park invites a new artist-in-residence to install art and work with the public during set hours at the museum\u2019s Kimball Education Gallery (free, 1 to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday, plus Friday evenings until 8:45 p.m.). Recent artists have included Shawn Feeney, an artist and musician whose \u201cMusical Anatomy\u201d series featured an inventive tuning-fork helmet that visitors could wear \u2014 while he was playing it. In October, the San Francisco artist Carlo Abruzzese transformed census data into meticulous architectural paintings.The 36 Hours column last Sunday, about San Francisco, described incorrectly the state of the Embarcadero Freeway after the 1989 Lomo Prieta earthquake.

{"Headline": "Uniting Behind the Divisive \u2018Cadillac\u2019 Tax on Health Plans", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewOne of us, a former member of the Obama administration, remains a fan of the president. The other, not so much. But we agree on one thing: The excise tax on high-cost health care plans, the so-called Cadillac tax, is good policy. Congress should side with President Obama and resist calls to scrap it.Let\u2019s start with the basics. Health insurance should be an ingredient of every family\u2019s financial plan. Medical expenses are necessary and unpredictable, and they can be large. When a family receives an adverse health surprise, the emotional toll is unavoidable, but the risks of financial insecurity, personal bankruptcy and forgone essential care are not. Health insurance solves these problems by protecting people from the cost of expensive treatments.But as with a glass of red wine with dinner, too much of a good thing creates new problems. If people have insurance that pays for too much, they don\u2019t have enough skin in the game. They may be too quick to seek professional medical care. They may too easily accede when physicians recommend superfluous tests and treatments. They may not try hard enough to buy services from the lowest-cost provider. Such behavior can drive national health spending beyond what is necessary and desirable.An optimal insurance policy strikes the right balance. It protects people against large financial risks but still has them pay enough to be smart consumers. That\u2019s why most insurance policies include deductibles and co-payments.Here is where the tax code enters the story. Compensation in the form of wages and salaries is subject to the income tax and the payroll tax. But compensation in the form of employer-provided health insurance is not subject to either. If a firm gives a dollar in wages to a typical worker, the worker keeps only about 65 cents; if the firm gives a dollar in health coverage to the same worker, the worker keeps the full dollar.This asymmetry tilts the playing field in favor of paying workers in insurance rather than in cash. As a result, people end up with insurance that is excessive and wages that are too low. The nation ends up spending too much on health care.The Cadillac tax helps level the playing field by curbing this subsidy for the most generous insurance plans, which do the most to drive up health costs. Starting in 2018, the policy will tax the excess of health insurance costs above a threshold ($10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage). Once it is in effect, companies that have paid workers in the form of expansive health coverage will have an incentive to scale back this insurance and pay more in the form of wages and salaries.Might companies use the Cadillac tax as an excuse to reduce health coverage and, instead of increasing wages, simply pocket the savings? Some may try, but the success of this strategy would be fleeting. In the long run, the compensation of labor, like most prices in the economy, is governed by supply and demand. Any employer that tries to pay less than the market requires will struggle to recruit and retain workers.To some, the Cadillac tax is unpopular simply because they see it as a tax increase. We prefer to think of it as limiting a government subsidy that stems from the tax exclusion of employer-provided health insurance. The government recognizes this subsidy in its annual budget as a tax expenditure. Though the Cadillac tax reduces the deficit modestly, its main objective is not to increase government revenue but to move the nation toward a more efficient system of health insurance.To some, the Cadillac tax is unpopular because unions oppose it, having negotiated especially generous health plans. But legislators should not let special interests stand in the way of a more rational health care system for all Americans.To some, the Cadillac tax is unpopular because it was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. But the Cadillac tax can be evaluated as a stand-alone measure. Both fans and critics of Obamacare should see the merits in a more level playing field between alternative forms of compensation.One of us worked for President Obama when the Affordable Care Act was passed. One of us worked for President George W. Bush and supported John McCain and Mitt Romney in their attempts to defeat Mr. Obama. We disagree on many things, but we agree that health policy is too important to treat as if it were nothing more than another political battlefield.Some policies deserve bipartisan support. The Cadillac tax is one of them.N. Gregory Mankiw and Lawrence H. Summers are both economics professors at Harvard. Professor Mankiw was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. Professor Summers was director of the National Economic Council under President Obama and Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biased Lending Evolves, and Blacks Face Trouble Getting Mortgages", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey steered clear of black and Hispanic neighborhoods as they opened branches across New York and Connecticut, federal officials said. They focused on marketing mortgages in predominantly white sections of suburban New Jersey and Long Island, not here or in Bridgeport, Conn.The results were stark. In 2014, Hudson approved 1,886 mortgages in the market that includes New Jersey and sections of New York and Connecticut, federal mortgage data show. Only 25 of those loans went to black borrowers.Outlawed decades ago, redlining has re-emerged as a serious concern among regulators as banks have sharply retreated from providing home loans to African-Americans in the wake of the financial crisis.Over just the past 12 months, federal, state and city officials have successfully required banks to expand minority lending programs and, in some instances, to pay penalties as part of redlining settlements in Buffalo; Milwaukee; Providence, R.I.; Rochester; and St. Louis. And more banks are facing scrutiny. The Justice Department now has more active redlining investigations underway than at any other time in the past seven years, officials said.The effect on minority communities can be profound. Homeownership is a cornerstone of economic mobility, and without a stable group of homeowners, neighborhoods can be left vulnerable to blight and disrepair.The recent cases illustrate how redlining has evolved. Bankers no longer talk openly about denying loans to black people. Instead, officials said, some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations, deliberately placing branches, brokers and mortgage services outside minority communities, even as other banks find and serve borrowers in those neighborhoods.The intent of such management decisions is typically left unspoken, officials said. But in interviews with federal bank examiners, Hudson executives made their reluctance to venture into minority neighborhoods plain.It is \u201clike a whole other world,\u201d one lending executive told examiners from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, explaining why the bank failed to generate any mortgage applications from a minority neighborhood here.Fallout from the excesses of the subprime era in mortgage lending has, in some ways, set the stage for the discriminatory practices of today. As banks have tightened their credit lending standards to avoid risky loans, the percentage of blacks and Hispanics getting approved for mortgages has plunged.Grappling with foreclosures, job losses and battered credit scores, many minority borrowers have found it difficult to qualify for mortgages under the more stringent rules.Banks normally try to avoid borrowers who seem likely to default on their loans, but some stepped over the line, officials say, excluding entire communities and the creditworthy people who live in them.Federal and state officials said it was impossible to determine how widespread discriminatory lending had become. They believe a vast majority of banks are operating legally, but recent lawsuits have revealed striking disparities.The problem, consumer advocates said, had been simmering for years.\u201cIf you asked any person in the city of Buffalo to draw you that map, they could \u2014 anybody,\u201d said John Washington, a community organizer who works for PUSH Buffalo, an advocacy group. \u201cYou drive down Main Street and you look down the West Side and you will see wealth, and you look down the East Side and you see disinvestment.\u201dThe issue is also achingly familiar. Until the 1960s, banks openly starved minority communities of home loans with the full backing of the federal government.For decades, the Federal Housing Administration relied on so-called residential security maps to help decide which mortgages it would insure. The maps ranked and color-coded neighborhoods in cities across the country according to their perceived investment risk.With conventional loans so difficult to secure, many black people found themselves sidelined from the homeownership boom after World War II. Others were forced to turn to an underground economy that offered overpriced, predatory loans.Even after the passage of laws that banned discriminatory lending in the late 1960s and \u201970s, redlining persisted. Its modern-day form, though, is far less overt.New Jersey banks no longer respond explicitly, as some did in the late 1930s, when asked, \u201cAre there any areas in which loans will not be made?\u201d (\u201cNewark,\u201d some said.)Most of Hudson\u2019s customers would have had no idea that the bank was excluding blacks and Hispanics, officials said.A spokeswoman for Hudson did not respond to several requests for comment. But in a statement, Denis J. Salamone, the chief executive, said the bank believed it was meeting its fair lending obligations by buying loans originating in minority communities on the secondary market, adding that \u201cwe do not agree with the D.O.J.\u2019s and C.F.B.P.\u2019s claims against the bank,\u201d using the abbreviations for the federal agencies that sued his bank.Now the nation\u2019s seventh-largest savings bank, it built its business on traditional mortgages and prided itself on its old-fashioned feel.All the while, federal officials said, the bank was systematically avoiding minority communities as it expanded beyond its New Jersey roots into New York and Connecticut.The government\u2019s analysis of the bank\u2019s lending data shows that Hudson\u2019s competitors generated nearly three times as many home loan applications from predominantly black and Hispanic communities as Hudson did in a region that includes New York City, Westchester County and North Jersey, and more than 10 times as many home loan applications from black and Hispanic communities in the market that includes Camden, N.J.That same year, the financial protection agency, which initiated the redlining investigation, recommended that Hudson monitor its top brokers for redlining. The bank, which is based in Paramus, N.J., took no action, federal officials said.As part of the redlining settlement, Mr. Salamone, the bank\u2019s current chief executive, has agreed to open two full-service branches in minority neighborhoods, to increase outreach to those neighborhoods, and to invest $25 million in a loan-subsidy fund to increase the amount of credit extended to black and Hispanic borrowers.\u201cWe agree, and have always believed, that there should be no discrimination based on race, national origin, gender or age in obtaining a loan,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Bernanke Cautions on Emerging Markets", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ben S. Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told an audience at the London School of Economics on Wednesday evening that emerging markets represented the one risk to financial stability today.In a conversation with Professor Erik Berglof, Mr. Bernanke assured students and faculty members that the financial system was \u201ca lot safer\u201d today as banks have more capital and are subject to greater regulatory oversight. But he said that emerging markets and the way they react to rising interest rates in the United States were \u201ca risk area,\u201d though it was hard to know the magnitude and nature of the risk.Mr. Bernanke also expressed concern over the monetary firepower of central banks especially with interest rates languishing at historic lows. The risk, he said, is that whenever the next slowdown comes, \u201cwe will quickly go close to zero and it will be difficult for the central banks to get traction.\u201d\u201cHypothetically, if the economy was to slow down again, fiscal policy would have to be involved,\u201d he said.Mr. Bernanke said that one day when he was giving President Bush an economic briefing, as he routinely did, the president pulled up the pant leg on Mr. Bernanke\u2019s suit. For effect, Mr. Bernanke hitched up his pant leg before the London audience. He was dressed in a gray suit, much like the one he was wearing Wednesday evening, and tan socks.\u201cBen, this is the White House. We have certain standards,\u201d President Bush admonished, according to Mr. Bernanke. \u201cWhat is it with the tan socks?\u201dSeeking to appeal to the president\u2019s fiscal conservatism, Mr. Bernanke said he replied, \u201cI got these four for $10 at the Gap.\u201dThe next day, at a meeting at the White House, everyone in the room, including Vice President Dick Cheney, had their suit pants hiked to reveal tan socks, Mr. Bernanke said.At one point during their conversation on Wednesday, Mr. Berglof asked Mr. Bernanke to answer the question Queen Elizabeth II posed when she visited the school during the peak of the financial crisis: \u201cWhy did nobody notice it?\u201d\u201cThe queen had a very good question,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cWhile we saw housing prices were very high and subprime lending was performing poorly, those two things alone were not sufficient to cause the crisis we had. What we missed is that there was more vulnerability in the financial system than we knew.\u201dMany Wall Street investment banks had derivatives contracts and other securities that were tied to subprime mortgages, making the systemic risk arising from a subprime crisis far greater than was apparent at first.During his remarks, Mr. Bernanke sought to dispel a perception that the Fed and other policy makers made a conscious decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. Even today, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the view still persists among some.\u201cThe tools we had were inadequate\u201d to save Lehman, Mr. Bernanke said. Early efforts to line up a buyer for Lehman \u2013 first Bank of America and then the British bank Barclays \u2014 failed. The only remaining option was for the Fed to lend Lehman money. But Mr. Bernanke said that Lehman was \u201cso deeply in the red\u201d that the Fed did not have the financial muscle to bail it out.Before Mr. Bernanke became Fed chairman, he was well known in academic circles but was not a household name. During his talk, he recalled that his daughter, Alyssa, was starting college the fall after he took the job as Fed chairman. One day, Alyssa\u2019s roommate asked her what her father did. When Alyssa replied that her father was the chairman of the Federal Reserve, her roommate\u2019s jaw dropped as she declared: \u201cYour father is Alan Greenspan.\u201dToday, Mr. Bernanke is known around the globe and has many legacies, including, he noted, a highway \u201cexit in South Carolina.\u201dAnita Raghavan is the author of \u201cThe Billionaire\u2019s Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guess Who Else Is a Socialist?", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the side benefits of a well-watched national political debate is the exposure it brings to something obscure and forgotten \u2014 like Denmark. Who doesn\u2019t love a country that gave us a dish of frikadeller and rugbrod to go with paid parental leave and universal health care?\u201cI love Denmark,\u201d said Hillary Clinton during Tuesday\u2019s debate, by way of dismissing a quasi-socialist nation of 5.7 million mostly white people as not the best place to look for solving the problems of a multiethnic democracy of 322 million.But in fact, the United States may be closer to Denmark than many think. In the reddest of red states \u2014 say, Idaho \u2014 you can find the kind of socialism, through publicly owned utilities or the federal dam that farmers rely on for their water, that would be right at home among aquavit-sipping Danes.Once you label something socialist, it brings to mind dour Soviet types trotting out dreary worker clothing for the spring fashion line. Or, here at home, those insufferable parlor room Marxists who think it would be utopia if only we nationalized every Starbucks. In that sense, the worst thing about socialism is the socialists.Free of the label, a hybrid economy where health care, education and pensions for the elderly are provided, side-by-side-by-side with creative capitalism, works pretty well in the Nordic countries, Britain and Canada. And most of the tenets of what is considered democratic socialism have majority support in the United States.But \u201csocialism\u201d as a word is poison in this country, except among the young, in large part because it\u2019s associated with failed authoritarian Marxist states. A recent Gallup poll found that half of Americans would not vote for a socialist. More people said they could accept an atheist as president than someone with the scarlet S.So we don\u2019t like \u201cthem.\u201d But we do like many of their ideas. We can thank Senator Bernie Sanders, self-proclaimed democratic socialist, for this healthy debate. This week, Donald Trump called him a \u201ccommunist.\u201d If so, you can find broad public support for most of the things advocated by the commie from Brooklyn.A majority of Americans feel \u201cmoney and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed,\u201d according to a CBS News/New York Times poll. Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage; so do 71 percent of Americans. Sanders believes corporations have too much influence on politics, as do 74 percent of Americans. And one of the biggest socialist programs \u2014 the single payer Medicare system that is a lifeline to more than 50 million people \u2014 is also one of the most popular.Nearly one in four people in this country gets electricity from a consumer-owned or co-op utility \u2014 socialism throughout the heartland. And when President Obama considered privatizing a big government utility and dam operator, the Tennessee Valley Authority, he was met with squawks of protest from some of the most conservative precincts in America.Obama is no socialist. A socialist would have nationalized General Motors, instead of returning it to capitalistic solvency. A socialist would not have presided over a doubling of the stock market, without adding significant new taxes to Wall Street\u2019s biggest beneficiaries.For true socialism in action, look to the billionaire Trump. As a developer, he\u2019s tried to use eminent domain \u2014 \u201cstate-sanctioned thievery,\u201d in the words of National Review Online \u2014 to get other people\u2019s property. There\u2019s your communist. He has no problem taking from others to serve the public \u201cgood.\u201dCapitalism at its best gives us iPhones and 400 kinds of ice cream and rewards enterprise and innovation. The free market has no small amount of magic. At its worst, capitalism produces pharmaceutical companies that gouge for lifesaving drugs, insurance companies that drop people once they get sick, and a system where secretaries pay a higher percentage of their earnings in taxes than billionaires who do nothing.Socialism at its best can run an army, a health care system and provide quality education for those who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford one. Libraries and fire departments are socialist institutions. So is the Interstate System of highways created under President Eisenhower. Ditto the nation\u2019s most popular cultural enterprise, the National Football League, which shares its television billions with losers among the teams. At its worst, socialism is grim and stifling, a dead-end for creativity.The key is to find a balance, as Hillary Clinton said in Tuesday\u2019s debate. \u201cOur job is to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn\u2019t run amok,\u201d she said. In that sentiment, you could hear the historical echo of two great progressive presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin, both of whom sought to save capitalism from itself.She also said, \u201cWe are not Denmark.\u201d Nope. Not by any stretch. Denmark has a slightly higher tax load on its citizens than the United States. But it also has budget surpluses, universal health care, shorter working hours, and was recently rated by Forbes magazine as the best country in the world for business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW\u2019s Emissions Scandal Has Its German Hometown Facing an Uneasy Future", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWolfsburg JournalWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 This sturdy, workaday city in northern Germany has long been known as the birthplace of the \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d \u2014 the Volkswagen.But even though the Volkswagen Group\u2019s hulking plant and headquarters still dominate the skyline and local economy, city planners in recent years have tried to forge a more modern identity for Wolfsburg and its 125,000 inhabitants.The gritty downtown near the railway station has been given a makeover, crowned by a futuristic science center by the Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid. A gleaming soccer stadium was erected, home to VfL Wolfsburg, the 2015 German Cup winners. There is now a water park, an indoor ice arena and an annual international dance and music festival. There are more than a dozen new commercial and industrial parks that have nothing to do with the manufacture of cars or auto parts.\u201cEveryone is very tense,\u201d said Carsten Baschin, editor in chief of the Wolfsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, one of the main dailies. \u201cThere is a lot of fear in the city.\u201dThe crisis that has erupted around Volkswagen over the past few weeks has been a reminder of the older reality \u2014 that the automaker provides 72,000 jobs at the Wolfsburg plant. And that number does not include the thousands of other jobs in the region at companies that supply Volkswagen.Last week, after Volkswagen said it was setting aside 6.5 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion, in the third quarter to cover expected costs from the scandal, Klaus Mohrs, the mayor of Wolfsburg, issued a public warning of an impending drop in corporate tax revenue. The mayor said it was too soon to cite numbers, but announced a municipal hiring freeze and a halt on any new projects, despite the city\u2019s current balanced budget.\u201cWhat is clear, we will have to examine many measures for the continued development of our city,\u201d he said in the statement.Worries about the repercussions dominate conversations around the city.Three schoolchildren standing on the corner of Porsche Street one evening seemed to know all about Volkswagen\u2019s deceptions and the likely creeping effect on the local economy.\u201cIn politics class we spoke about the situation,\u201d said Sofie, 14, who only gave her first name. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good that it was concealed.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Her friend, Olivia, also 14, said her older brother, who worked in seating technology for Volkswagen cars, had been given a week off because of the uncertainty.Nearby, waiting for a bus outside the main station, Gerhard Tscherner, 64, a retired engineer, said his family\u2019s fortunes depended on a good resolution to the problems: His son, daughter and son-in-law all work for the automaker.Wearing a black cap against the cold wind, Mr. Tscherner spoke about guilt and the need for accountability within the company. But he also expressed worry about what that accounting might lead to in the lives of citizens if Volkswagen must pay fines or if its newfound notoriety causes it to lose customers worldwide.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about billions,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cPeople built their homes believing the money would always be there to pay for them. That could change.\u201dMayor Mohrs said that as the city has sought to diversify its economy, with considerable expansion in tourism and in the service sector over the past decade, the growth has created problems of its own. Wolfsburg already faces a dire shortage of housing, and its population is expected to expand by 9 percent over the next decade.There are no plans to scale back the expansion of housing stock, Mr. Mohrs said. But he cautioned that \u201cwe will have to wait and see how the situation at Volkswagen develops.\u201dThe city and company have been inextricably linked from the beginning. There was no Wolfsburg until 1938, when the Nazis chose that patch of land along the Midland Canal, with access to the Baltic Sea, as the site for making Europe\u2019s first mass-produced vehicles.After the war, Wolfsburg was swelled by immigrants who arrived from eastern and southern Europe to work in the iconic brick factory, inspired by the Ford River Rouge plant in Detroit.More recently, the maker of the Beetle and of the hippie van has grown into a global automotive group, expanding its sales in China and North America, acquiring luxury brands like Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti, while broadening its own models to include turbo diesel S.U.V.s and luxury limousines. (Various Golf models, the Touran and Tiguan marques, and drive shafts and other components are made at Wolfsburg.)One day last week, the four great brown chimneys of the carmaker\u2019s own power plant loomed high over the rooftops, as clouds of steam trailed into the sky. Workers passed through the factory gates in the brisk early morning air to the 1,600-acre complex that turns out about 830,000 vehicles annually.Right next to the main complex is Autostadt, Volkswagen\u2019s theme park of manicured gardens, lakes, and glassy atriums that was built 15 years ago as a way to make the company more transparent and inviting, and to play a role in Wolfsburg\u2019s effort to become a magnet for international tourism.Visitors to Autostadt can sit behind the wheel of the latest Porsche model, marvel at the roar of a Lamborghini Murcielago engine or drive an Amarok over a boulder-strewn obstacle course. Customers who have ordered cars can pick them up at the theme park.Some 2.2 million people visited last year. So far, despite the scandal, visitor numbers have held steady, said Tobias Riepe, an Autostadt spokesman.The reaction among Wolfsburg city officials to the revelations of Volkswagen\u2019s cheating has been mainly one of stunned silence. The company has shut down most of its outward communications as it has struggled to adjust to the crisis, which claimed a chief executive and has erased more than $17 billion from the company\u2019s stock market value. And many factory workers and even the city historian declined to comment about the scandal.Mr. Baschin, the newspaper editor, said Volkswagen had survived other crises \u2014 like the episode in 2005 when the head of the company\u2019s works council was jailed over a sex and bribery scandal. But nothing until now, he said, has so threatened the company\u2019s long-cultivated image as builder of solid, reliable vehicles. With criminal and civil investigations underway in the United States, Germany and elsewhere in Europe, the company\u2019s corporate future may be hanging in the balance.So despite Wolfsburg\u2019s efforts to become something more than a one-company factory town, people here are engaged in civic soul searching about the international corporation that put them on the global map.\u201cWe hope the problem is solved,\u201d said Dennis, 34, who works in logistics and would give only his first name, as he made his way one recent morning to the factory entrance.\u201cWe are a big family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all asking the same question, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opinion: The Misguided Efforts of American Energy Companies", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyA global battle for a share of Asia\u2019s future energy demand is on, and Middle East suppliers may win it. Both the United States and Asia would benefit, however, if American companies won a greater presence in the region. American companies could gain a strong share of Asia\u2019s future demand if they could compete aggressively against Middle Eastern producers. They will earn this right only by focusing on the right to export and by not fighting carbon-reduction measures at home.Leveraging the current American energy boom by allowing unfettered oil and liquefied natural gas exports \u2014 which are highly restricted as a result of now-obsolete energy policies \u2014 would demonstrate the United States\u2019 global leadership, create more competitive markets and reduce Asia\u2019s dependence on coal by making natural gas more affordable.The reality in the United States, however, is that any opening of exports must be balanced with progress on the environment. Regrettably, America\u2019s leading energy companies are more focused on fighting domestic efforts to reduce carbon emissions than on gaining the freedom to compete abroad.That misplaced fight, based on ideology or efforts to eke out a modest increment of declining American energy demand, undermines the future of the American industry and delays important national security benefits.At the summit meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna last November, Saudi Arabia officially went ahead with its stated intention to abandon the role of swing producer. This is part of a long-term strategy to delay high-cost oil investment, undercut investment in Iraq and Iran, cool the United States\u2019 shale boom until demand recovers, and build out Saudi refining and petrochemical capacity while oil prices are low.Thus the seeds of the next oil boom are already being sown. Saudi Arabia\u2019s policy has resulted in about $220 billion worth of investment cuts worldwide, much of which is a result of project deferrals, including deepwater projects off West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico. The last Gulf of Mexico auction was a historic disappointment. Mexico, Brazil and Iraq are all discussing how to adapt to more competitive fiscal or legal frameworks, but internal politics have allowed only marginal improvements. Asia\u2019s strategic partners are increasingly Middle Eastern suppliers, which collectively hold around 55 percent of regional market share.When demand recovers, as it did in 2003 and 2011 largely because of revived economic growth in developing parts of Asia, or if supply disruptions resulting from unrest in other Middle East countries limit access to energy supplies and drive up prices, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab OPEC nations will be poised to recover lost rents.Conventional, low-cost Middle East members of OPEC will be much faster to market than many non-OPEC nations with deepwater prospects requiring sustained exploration and development.The United States can be the spoiler in this contest if its companies are permitted to compete for the Asian market. If Washington eases the path for exports of oil and L.N.G., it can make these markets more competitive. The United States has now permitted 10 billion cubic feet per day of L.N.G. export capacity to nations with which it has no free-trade agreements. Unrestricted exports would allow new trading relationships to develop between the United States and allies like Japan and South Korea as well as partners like India and Taiwan.Also \u2014 not for nothing \u2014 such a policy would avoid ceding oil and condensate markets in Europe and Asia to Iran, should that country comply with the terms of the nuclear deal with the United States and five other nations, and thus secure sanctions relief.The United States\u2019 shale industry has already surprised Saudi Arabia with its resiliency, cutting costs and raising production even as prices for West Texas Intermediate crude shrank from $100 to $45 a barrel.But the shale industry cannot win a long price war with Saudi Arabia without some relief. Its future lies not in a domestic market with flat and declining gasoline consumption, but in Asia when growth recovers, as well as in a better-diversified Europe and in the emerging markets of Latin America and Africa.So it is hard to understand why the leading American energy companies and their trade associations are putting more effort into fighting President Obama\u2019s initiatives to reduce emissions from stationary power generation sources, methane leakage from oil and gas operations, and emissions of toxic chemicals more broadly.Given long-term projections of total energy demand, pursuit of these goals is not inconsistent with strong American production over the next several decades.But by taking a maximalist approach and opposing nearly every climate initiative, the industry is marginalizing itself in the political arena and demonizing itself in the public eye. This is one reason that the oil and gas industry in the United States is viewed far less positively than the industry in Europe.There is a better path forward that can benefit both American prosperity and national security.First, the industry should stand down on its opposition to President Obama\u2019s authority to start his Clean Power Plan and new ozone rules.Second, recognizing that comprehensive tax reform is likely early in the next administration, the industry should accept that swapping acceptance and funding of solar and wind tax expenditures for declaring all oil and L.N.G. exports in the national interest under existing authorities is an excellent bargain.Third, American producers need to understand that time is of the essence \u2014 the prospects of an OPEC production cut in the near term are low. In order to provide price relief to its competitors, many of which are geopolitical foes, Saudi Arabia would probably want a commensurate production cut from non-OPEC member Russia, an allocation of production quotas with Iran and Iraq that it would view as fair, and genuine Iranian efforts to decrease or cease its support for proxies in the Middle East.These are concessions Saudi Arabia is unlikely to attain.The Obama administration would be wise to grant American producers the export relief they seek, in exchange for the extension of solar and wind credits and subsidies that are critical to its Climate Action Plan.For economic reasons, the United States should make every effort to sustain its energy boom, which has provided low-cost electricity, job growth, investment incentives and climate benefits in an otherwise stagnant economy.For national security reasons, the United States should deepen energy trade ties with Asia and Europe. It should fear tying Asia\u2019s future energy demand to the Middle East, not facilitate it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Anti-Muslim Campaign, Canada Has Its Trump Moment", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMontreal \u2014 IT is easy to tut-tut the overindulgences of the American right. For Canadians, it is practically a birthright. None of our politicians, many of us would like to believe, would dare invoke the Trumpian galaxy of Mexican rapists, or ponder publicly, as the Republican candidate Ben Carson did, that Europe\u2019s Jews would have fared better against Hitler if only the Third Reich hadn\u2019t instituted gun control.Yet over the last several weeks of an increasingly caustic election campaign, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Canada\u2019s ruling Conservative Party have managed to erase much of our trademark smugness.Faced with a stalling economy and a corresponding dip in the polls, Mr. Harper had a stroke of luck. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed his government\u2019s ban on the niqab \u2014 the face veil worn as part of the hijab by a small minority of Muslim women \u2014 from Canadian citizenship ceremonies.Rather than accept the ruling, the Conservative government proclaimed its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court, and then took the issue to the hustings. During a recent campaign debate, Mr. Harper declared that he \u201cwill never tell my young daughter that a woman should cover her face because she is a woman\u201d \u2014 as though his political opponents would do just that, given the chance.Effectively, Mr. Harper hopes to win his fourth term on Oct. 19 in part by demonizing those few who wear the niqab \u2014 and much of Canada\u2019s Muslim population by extension. In one particularly pungent mailing to voters, the Conservative Party suggested that the election of one of Mr. Harper\u2019s opponents would turn the country into a dystopia of high taxes, high unemployment and citizenship ceremonies clogged with covered Muslim faces pledging allegiance to the queen.The truth is decidedly more banal. Since 2011, all of two women out of 700,000 new citizens have refused to doff their niqab during the ceremony, according to a Radio-Canada report. And those who do wear the niqab must remove it before the ceremony for identification purposes. But nuance and perspective only impede the Conservative narrative.The campaign has since announced its intention to start a police tip line for \u201cbarbaric cultural practices,\u201d so that Canadians can report such things as forced marriages and female genital mutilation. Mr. Harper himself mused that he would seek to forbid federal public servants to wear the niqab.In this fear-mongering, many see the hand of Lynton Crosby, the Australian political operative who had been advising the Conservatives, according to a campaign spokesman. A veteran of winning campaigns for the former Australian prime minister John Howard and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, Mr. Crosby is known for his use of divisive social issues, if only to spur political apoplexy from political opponents and populist outrage from the masses.If Mr. Crosby was indeed involved, then his work is done. Both Thomas Mulcair, the New Democratic Party leader, and Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, have called out Mr. Harper for stoking the fears of the voting public. This very voting public, a government poll suggested, is staunchly against the wearing of the niqab, a sentiment that the prime minister has used as a cudgel whenever he speaks about the issue. (A national poll from The Globe and Mail this week had the niqab well down the list of voter concerns.)But the Conservative Party\u2019s scapegoating of Canadian Muslims dates from well before this campaign. The government first banned the niqab from citizenship ceremonies in 2011, but its directive was successfully challenged by Zunera Ishaq, a former high-school teacher from Pakistan.More recently, government officials said Syrian refugees would be prioritized, with first dibs given to the country\u2019s religious (read: Christian) minority. Mr. Harper\u2019s own office was found to have personally intervened in the processing of Syrian refugees. Coincidentally or not, Canada has admitted only about 10 percent of the 10,000 the government had promised it would accept.The foot-dragging is a marked deviation from Canada\u2019s history of accepting refugees fleeing strife. In 1979, the Progressive Conservative government of the time began admitting some additional 50,000 Vietnamese refugees. The comparatively modest number of accepted Syrian refugees has riled some within the Canadian military, with which the Conservative brand (the \u201cProgressive\u201d was lopped off in 2003) is closely associated.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop being afraid of our own shadow,\u201d said Rick Hillier, a beloved retired Canadian general who says the country could easily accept 50,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year.Though Mr. Harper\u2019s anti-niqab gambit had some initial success, there are indications it might not ultimately be a winning strategy. The latest poll numbers have the Liberals ahead of the Conservatives for the first time in this campaign. The separatist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois tried similar fear-stoking in last year\u2019s Quebec election, but the tactic failed miserably.And Zunera Ishaq recently recited Canada\u2019s Oath of Citizenship from behind those few square inches of face-covering cloth. This is what progress sounds like in a campaign of fear.An Op-Ed article on Friday incorrectly described Ben Carson\u2019s status in the Republican contest for president. He is a candidate, not the nominee.Martin Patriquin is the Quebec bureau chief for Maclean\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Unveils Tough Draft Budget for 2016", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 As Greece\u2019s economy remains on shaky ground, its government unveiled on Monday a tough draft budget for 2016, heralding a series of tax increases and spending cuts to comply with creditors\u2019 demands for a third bailout.While such moves will help Greece to get the first installment of financial aid from the bailout, the budget also portends a difficult economic environment. The recession, according to the plan, will continue \u2014 the economy is expected to shrink by 2.3 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016. Both figures are in line with creditors\u2019 estimates. Greece\u2019s debt crisis has weighed heavily on its economy. Despite an increase in tourism, one of the country\u2019s few dynamic industries, the imposition of capital controls over the summer dealt a major blow to the first shy signs of growth. The restrictions, which have since been relaxed somewhat, were put in place to avert a banking-sector collapse.The draft budget also expects the central government\u2019s debt to rise to 198 percent of gross domestic product next year, from 187.6 percent now. The new bailout loans account for much of the increase.In the speech, Mr. Tsipras, who was re-elected last month, emphasized his commitment to carrying out the new bailout while seeking alternatives to some of the more onerous measures. His government\u2019s top priorities, he said, were to reduce the country\u2019s debt, recapitalize struggling banks and attract sorely needed foreign investments. (His new government faces a vote of confidence on Wednesday, which Mr. Tsipras will probably secure.)Earlier in the day, Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s finance minister, met with his eurozone peers in Luxembourg to discuss the raft of economic changes that Greece must immediately legislate to unlock the first 2 billion euro installment from the \u20ac86 billion bailout. These changes include cracking down on tax evasion and fuel smuggling, liberalizing the energy market and introducing stricter criteria for the protection of overly indebted homeowners.The budget outlines a variety of measures intended to meet the bailout requirements, like increasing the sales tax on hotels and paring government spending on indebted pension funds. In all, the tax increases and spending cuts are expected to add some \u20ac4.3 billion to the country\u2019s coffers.The government\u2019s new draft budget foresees a primary surplus of 0.5 percent of G.D.P. next year. The lower primary surplus \u2014 the amount of revenue that Greece is required to hold after expenses have been paid and before servicing its debt \u2014 is one of the few concessions that Mr. Tsipras managed to extract from creditors. In theory, it frees up more money for Greece to spend on stimulating its economy.Mr. Tspiras, in his speech, also underscored the need to soften the blow for Greeks. For example, he promised to suspend a hugely unpopular plan for a 23 percent sales tax on private schools.\u201cWe have managed to secure the country\u2019s financial stability and to definitively stop debate about Grexit,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said, referring to the term for a potential Greek exit from the euro. He said enforcing the bailout terms \u201cis a necessary condition.\u201dHe added, however, that his leftist-led coalition would strive to \u201crestore social justice and the dignity of the Greek people and work for a society of equality and prosperity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Long Road From \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018Yes\u2019", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greeks will commemorate the Oct. 28 national holiday in a very different country from what it was a year ago. The anniversary marks the day in 1940 when a Greek government rejected an ultimatum from Fascist Italy to allow its troops to enter the country. The \u201cNo\u201d (\u201cOchi\u201d in Greek) united a deeply divided country behind a right-wing dictatorship and thrust Greece into World War II on the side of the Allies. \u201cNo\u201d is a symbol of defiance. But now Greeks must decide what they want, rather than what they reject.Despite divisions and strife, the \u201cNo\u201d of 1940 has stood as a unifying memory of a nation that will tolerate no foreign master. Recently, though, in the throes of a devastating economic crisis, the Greeks were divided once again, and the talismanic \u201cNo\u201d was commandeered by one side.An unbroken chain of defiant \u201cNo\u201ds had resulted in a reluctant \u201cYes.\u201dSo once again, we have a government that has halfheartedly committed itself to austerity and reform in exchange for lifesaving loans. Syriza won snap elections on Sept. 20, as voters appeared to reward it both for its resistance to creditors and for the turnaround that averted further damage. A die-hard \u201cNo\u201d faction that split from Syriza failed to get into Parliament. Syriza, in other words, does not face the uncompromising opposition that it showed previous governments. But it has to make the third bailout succeed where the previous ones did not.This year\u2019s Oct. 28 commemoration will probably be a somber affair. Some small groups may organize protests to exploit the occasion, but most of us Greeks are coming to terms with the fact that uniting to fight off invaders may be less difficult than uniting to reform our country.Nikos Konstandaras is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Threat From Within", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHOUSTON \u2014 ON Oct. 13, 1765, the writer James Boswell arrived in Corsica to meet the nationalist hero Pasquale Paoli. The trip was remarkable in part because the island \u2014 home to a wild people fighting one another when not fighting off foreign conquerors \u2014 had never before been explored by someone from England. It was no less remarkable because Boswell, though a resident of London, was not English, but rather a Scot, whose conservative Tory politics mixed with romantic nostalgia for his own nation\u2019s lost independence.As Boswell later explained in his account of his visit with Paoli, he wanted \u201cto find what was to be seen no where else, a people actually fighting for liberty.\u201dTwo hundred and fifty years later, a growing welter of political movements in Britain, France, Spain and other European countries see themselves as the inheritors of the same ideals that drove Boswell and Paoli. While Europe\u2019s eastern borders are being tested by the refugee crisis, the borders of western European states are being challenged within by native separatist movements. The two forces, rather like the collision of tectonic plates, threaten to undermine both the traditional nation states of Europe and the European Union supra-state.The most recent tremor shook Europe a few weeks ago, when an alliance of conservative and progressive parties seeking to secede from Spain won the regional elections in Catalonia. But the rumble of secessionism reaches well beyond Spain.Just north of the Pyrenees, French politicians and pundits are preparing for regional elections in December. Much of the conversation, inevitably, has been about the future of the far-right National Front Party, headed by Marine Le Pen, who has yoked her party\u2019s electoral fortunes to the threats posed to France\u2019s sovereignty, from both Brussels bureaucrats and the refugees. When not decrying France\u2019s \u201csubmission\u201d to the European Union, Ms. Le Pen is busy comparing the refugees to the \u201cbarbarian invasions of the fourth century.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s xenophobic tirades threaten the French republican ideal \u2014 but so do native political movements. Along with independence or autonomist parties in Brittany and the Basque Country, there is also the flurry of electoral activity among the Corsicans. In the regional elections of 2010, Corsica\u2019s nationalist parties, once a marginalized and murderous fringe that now forswears violence, won 25 percent of the vote. (The National Front, on the other hand, scraped by with less than 5 percent.) The leader of one pro-independence party, Jean-Guy Talamoni, claimed at the annual party congress earlier this month that a majority of Corsicans, galvanized by the examples of Scotland and Catalonia, now desired independence.France\u2019s continued economic difficulties, and the general disenchantment with traditional political parties, will only feed autonomist support in Corsica. More than 20,000 fans of the team in Bastia, the capital of Corsica and its second-largest city, recently traveled to Paris and chanted \u201cOn n\u2019est pas fran\u00e7ais\u201d \u2014 \u201cWe aren\u2019t French\u201d \u2014 during a match against Paris Saint-Germain (the Corsicans lost).Even the renowned historian Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie, despite his scorn for Corsica\u2019s many independence parties, concedes they may well have a future: \u201cJust as Algeria\u2019s independence was both absurd and inevitable, that of Corsica is no less absurd but, who knows, perhaps also inevitable.\u201dIncreasingly active are other separatist parties in France \u2014 the rise of the Bonnets Rouges movement in Brittany is especially notable \u2014 while the separatist drives of the Flemish and Walloon populations have turned neighboring Belgium into the world\u2019s most benign failed state. Across the Continent there are dozens of similar movements, many of which have allied under the banner of the European Free Alliance.Inevitably, the politics of these separatist movements differ; in the cases of Catalonia and Scotland they tend toward the left, while in Corsica they instead bend right.No less inevitably, their national contexts also differ. Concentrating power in Paris over the centuries, France is allergic to the federalist model of Spain, and is, quite literally, constitutionally incapable of imagining the sort of negotiations that would take place between London and Edinburgh to dissolve the Act of Union. And while economically prosperous Scotland and Catalonia want to control their wealth and resources, the less prosperous Corsica wishes to prevent continued land purchases by well-to-do mainlanders.But despite their differences, the cases of Corsica, Catalonia and Scotland pose a common challenge not just to their respective nations, but also to a certain idea of Europe.It is doubtful that the European Union would respond any more coherently to a separatist crisis than it has to the refugee crisis. Brussels has refused to say whether a state born from a separatist seed would accede automatically to union membership or instead need to go through the lengthy and laborious application process of other states.Yet, while Brussels has artfully maintained confusion over this issue, it has itself long cultivated regionalist claims by providing a forum where regions engage in so-called para-diplomacy, showcasing their cultures and economies to member states and regions. As a result, all of these movements have linked, both paradoxically and unsurprisingly, their own goal of statehood to the ideal of an integrated Europe.Boswell was so enraptured by his Corsican adventure that he not only wrote a book about it, but appeared at the Stratford-upon-Avon Jubilee dressed as a Corsican rebel: kerchief tied around his neck, pistol strapped to his waist and musket slung over his shoulder.\u201cI was as much a favourite as I could desire,\u201d he told friends.The Corsicans have since dropped the guns and knotted ties around their necks. It may soon be the time for them, along with Catalonia and Boswell\u2019s native Scotland, to repeat his success, but this time on the stage of history.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australians Look Like Potential World Cup Champions", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRugbyTWICKENHAM, England \u2014 A world championship without the home team involved can feel like a party whose host has already gone to bed, and that will be the case for the final four weeks of the Rugby World Cup, after the eviction of England by Australia.England\u2019s loss was Wales\u2019s gain. The loss put Wales into the World Cup quarterfinals alongside Australia, meaning that the meeting of the two next Saturday at Twickenham will determine who it will be that they play in the quarterfinals, with the winner getting a lower-seeded opponent.England, third in Pool A with one win and two losses, is the first primary host in eight World Cup tournaments not to reach the knockout stage and also the first former champion \u2014 it won the Cup in 2003 \u2014 to fail to progress. It has one match left, against Uruguay in Manchester next Saturday.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how disappointed we are,\u201d said England Coach Stuart Lancaster. \u201cWe have had fantastic support and we feel we\u2019ve let them and the whole country down.\u201dLancaster, who has been coach since 2011 and is under contract through 2019, acknowledged his job could be at risk, \u201cbut that is not just my decision.\u201dShould he depart, it will be with considerable credit and sympathy. While England has disappointed in this tournament, its performance was nothing like the embarrassment and disarray that it showed at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand. Lancaster has restored English rugby\u2019s reputation and credibility, winning 80 percent of his games (although with no titles) in the European Six Nations championship, and it has the only victory in the past decade by a European nation over New Zealand.His misfortune was that England was placed in the toughest group in World Cup history \u2014 a consequence of the organizers\u2019 insistence that the draw be held in 2012, little more than a year into the four-year World Cup cycle.Lancaster said that England\u2019s biggest failure was not winning a match it dominated the previous weekend against Wales. \u201cWe scored four tries against Fiji and led 22-12 against Wales and should have finished the job,\u201d he said Saturday.But where England was ambushed by Wales, it was dismantled by Australia. Australia is not always the strongest team in test rugby, but it makes the best use of limited resources. Rugby union is far from the biggest game in Australia, outweighed in New South Wales and Queensland by rugby league and in the rest of the country by Australian rules football, both of which held their finals over the weekend.They may, though, be good enough to win the World Cup. If the tournament lost its host Saturday night, it also saw its first championship-caliber performance.\u201cOn that performance, yes, definitely,\u201d was Lancaster\u2019s response when asked if Australia could take the trophy. \u201cThey were strong in all areas, they\u2019ve got a good balance in their game and have got some world-class players.\u201dBernard Foley, Australia\u2019s much-criticized flyhalf, was the star. He scored 28 of Australia\u2019s 33 points, including the two first-half tries that silenced the 80,000 fans at Twickenham by giving the visitors a 17-3 lead at halftime. Foley\u2019s second score, a lightning-sharp break through the English defense combined with a deft exchange of passes with the replacement wing Kurtley Beale, was as good as anything seen in the tournament.Australia\u2019s quick, combative back-rowers, David Pocock and Michael Hooper, dominated the battle for possession at the breakdown, thwarting several England attacks by stealing possession. And the scrum, traditionally an Australian weakness, more than matched up with England, which usually expects to dominate that part of the game.England did not go without a fight. After George Ford, dropped after the opening match against Fiji, came on as a halftime replacement, England looked much sharper and closed the gap to 20-13 with 15 minutes to go.\u201cWe did have a dark period in the second half, but we managed it a lot better than we have in the past,\u201d said Australia Coach Michael Cheika.Any doubt was ended when England flyhalf Owen Farrell was yellow-carded and given a 10-minute suspension for a dangerous tackle on Australia\u2019s inside center Matt Giteau with nine minutes left. Foley kicked the resulting penalty to make it 23-13, then added another three-pointer and a conversion of Giteau\u2019s last-minute try to seal Australia\u2019s victory.\u201cI\u2019m very pleased,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect; there are still a lot of areas that we can improve on.\u201dAustralia won both of the previous World Cups hosted or co-hosted in Britain, in 1991 and 1999, and it would be no surprise to see it complete the hat trick.While one former champion went out, another dodged a bullet Saturday when South Africa beat Scotland, 34-16, in Newcastle. It will reach the quarterfinals if it beats the United States on Wednesday, while Scotland will progress if it beats Samoa on Saturday. Japan, which produced another surprise Saturday by beating Samoa, 26-5, can progress by beating the United States on Sunday, should either South Africa or Scotland lose.An earlier version of this article misstated the equivalent, in American dollars, of 3 billion British pounds.

Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland has been introducing himself to Democratic voters for months in speeches, at rubber-chicken dinners and most recently in a Snapchat video in which he is shown studying on his iPad while doing a plank, in a tank top, at the gym.But he still is almost nowhere in the polls.On Tuesday he will have what could be his best chance to grab the kind of attention that could get his candidacy off the ground.It is also the only one of the four Democratic debates scheduled for a weeknight \u2014 meaning viewership is not likely to increase at the others.Mr. O\u2019Malley acknowledged this week that the debates would be \u201cmake or break.\u201d\u201cRight now, the people in my party, the only two candidates people have heard of are the inevitable front-runner and the senator from Vermont,\u201d he told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. \u201cSo once the debates happen, people will be able to hear from all of the candidates.\u201dA talented politician and forceful speaker with a long record of accomplishment, Mr. O\u2019Malley, 52, began his campaign in May with a great deal of potential. He has assiduously courted Democratic activists and has delivered well-received speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, promoting his early advocacy for same-sex marriage in Maryland and his liberal views on immigration.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Yet his efforts have yielded little support. Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s polling average on the website Real Clear Politics stands at 0.7 percent.\u201cPeople would pay big money if they could fix that problem,\u201d said Kevin Geiken, an Iowa-based Democratic operative who is not committed to a candidate but praises Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s political talent and what he called his in-depth focus on issues. \u201cIt seems to be sort of a curious thing with him. His speeches are all received very enthusiastically. It seems like he\u2019s doing the work in policy, he\u2019s doing the work getting people excited \u2014 but it\u2019s not showing up in the polls.\u201dThe same is true in New Hampshire.\u201cI\u2019ve seen him,\u201d State Representative Steve Shurtleff, who is not yet supporting a candidate, said. \u201cHe was very good, and the crowd seemed to appreciate his remarks.\u201dSo why isn\u2019t Mr. O\u2019Malley attracting greater interest? \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Shurtleff said.His allies say they expect him to gain attention later this year, when voters in the early primary states begin sharpening their preferences. Until then, Mr. O\u2019Malley is trying to position himself to pick up support if there are major shifts in the race.He has also become overtly critical of Mrs. Clinton, after refraining from mentioning her name early on. And, showing flashes of outrage \u2014 or a toothy grin \u2014 he has lobbed verbal grenades at the Democratic National Committee, accusing it of scheduling the primary debates to aid Mrs. Clinton while starving her rivals of critical exposure.An effective attack dog, Mr. O\u2019Malley was one of the few Democrats willing to publicly and frequently defend President Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign. But he may tone down the aggressiveness during Tuesday\u2019s debate, his first appearance in front of a large national television audience, when voters are just getting to know him.He came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in April, although he appeared open to supporting it in 2013; Mrs. Clinton declared her opposition to the pact on Wednesday. And privately, Mr. O\u2019Malley has described himself to voters who had clamored for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to run as the candidate who most shares her views.More recently on gun control, Mr. O\u2019Malley has repeatedly called for reinstating the assault-weapons ban since the mass shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., which could give him an opening to attack both Mr. Sanders, who was friendly to the gun lobby in Vermont for years, and Mrs. Clinton, whose recollections in the 2008 presidential primary of being taught to shoot by her father prompted Senator Barack Obama to say, \u201cShe\u2019s talking like she\u2019s Annie Oakley!\u201dAt a taping of \u201cIowa Press,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said, \u201cSecretary Clinton can come on the show and answer for herself why she shifted her positions on so many issues over the course of these last few months.\u201dMrs. Clinton would have an easy response to just about any attack from Mr. O\u2019Malley: He supported her in that 2008 contest, and wrote an op-ed essay in which he praised the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, of which he was once a member.\u201cO\u2019Malley was one of Senator Clinton\u2019s strongest and most vociferous supporters in 2008 \u2014 a fact that I\u2019m pretty sure is not lost on Hillary, who will have those quotes in her pocket on Tuesday night,\u201d said David Axelrod, once Mr. Obama\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cIt could make his task a little more complicated in drawing contrasts.\u201dMr. O\u2019Malley could also face tough questioning about his time as mayor of Baltimore beginning in 1999, where he put in place the type of tough-on-crime practices that members of the Black Lives Matter movement say led to the use of excessive force by police officers. Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign kickoff came weeks after the death of Freddie Gray, who died in April of a spinal cord injury while he was in Baltimore police custody, set off days of protests and looting.Yet he has not let up. Asked in Washington this week about his chances in Tuesday\u2019s debate, he sounded decidedly upbeat.\u201cI believe our country is looking for new leadership,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley told reporters, according to a transcript provided by his campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t be this dissatisfied with our national politics and our national economy, and resort to old names to break us out of this gridlock of inaction. America is looking for a new leader.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Profit Edges Up for Quarter", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the bank\u2019s third-quarter results, released on Wednesday, suggested that its lead over its rivals might be slipping.Wells Fargo said it earned $1.05 a share in the third quarter, up 3 percent from the quarter a year ago and exceeding analysts\u2019 forecast for the period by a penny. The bank\u2019s net income was $5.8 billion in the third quarter, which was 1 percent higher than the $5.7 billion it earned in the same period a year earlier.\u201cWells Fargo\u2019s strong third-quarter results reflected the ability of our diversified business model to generate consistent financial performance in an uneven economic environment,\u201d John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Although small, the profit increase may be welcome to management and shareholders. In this year\u2019s second quarter, Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank in the country by assets, reported a yearly decline in net income, the first in many quarters.Wells Fargo\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $21.9 billion, slightly above what analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected and 3 percent higher than the $21.2 billion reported in the same period a year ago.Wells Fargo does not have a large presence on Wall Street, insulating it from much of the recent turbulence in global markets. It instead makes most of its money from lending to consumers and companies. Investors value Wells Fargo more highly than other banks because it has been significantly more profitable than its rivals.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.In the third quarter, Wells Fargo\u2019s return on equity \u2014 a closely watched yardstick that measures profits as a percentage of shareholders\u2019 equity \u2014 was 12.6 percent. That was well ahead of the 7 percent return at Bank of America, which also reported earnings on Wednesday.But it was only slightly higher than the 12 percent reported by JPMorgan Chase, which reported on Tuesday. And Wells Fargo\u2019s return on equity has slipped in recent quarters. A year ago, it was at 13.1 percent.In other words, Wells Fargo may have hit something of a wall. Sluggish revenue growth explains part of its drop in profitability, but the profit margin that Wells Fargo earns on its loans and securities has fallen even as its loans and securities have increased.Wells Fargo had $903 billion in loans in the third quarter, up 8 percent from $839 billion in the third quarter of last year. Loans to companies are growing faster at the bank than loans to consumers.Large banks have businesses that can produce larger-than-expected gains that benefit overall earnings \u2014 and perhaps help them exceed analysts\u2019 estimates. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo had $920 million of gains from equity investments, compared with $712 million in the same period a year earlier and $517 million in the second quarter of 2015.Wells Fargo\u2019s scope may give it a good eye into how the United States economy is going to perform. Mr. Shrewsberry said he expected its growth rate to pick up slightly next year.\u201cIf we are in a 2 percent G.D.P. growth environment this year, then we are in a 2.5 percent growth environment for next year,\u201d he said.Michael Corkery contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Should Offer Turkey a Better Deal After Its Elections", "Date": "2015-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe European Union may be dropping the ball over Turkey. The bloc has benefited for years from a stable country with an improving economy on its southeast border, insulating it from mayhem in the Middle East. But this buffer state is increasingly leaky and troubled, resulting in economic as well as political repercussions. So far the European Union\u2019s engagement with Turkey has been too little, too late.The turmoil in Turkey is mounting. The war in neighboring Syria has led to an influx of 2.2 million migrants; bombings this month killed 102 people in Ankara, the capital, at a rally that was called to promote peace between the government and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., the Kurdish militant group. On Friday, the Turkish military shot down a drone \u2014 thought by the United States to be Russian \u2014 in Turkish airspace near Syria.Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian attempts to shore up his political base are dividing Turkish society and pummeling its currency, the lira. Mr. Erdogan has tried to drive a wedge between the majority and the large Kurdish minority before elections set for Nov. 1. He has also taken serious steps to silence the media.All this matters to the European Union because hundreds of thousands of the migrants arriving in Turkey \u2014 not just Syrians, but Iraqis, Afghans and people of several other nationalities \u2014 in turn head toward the bloc.In time, the influx may be a boon to the European Union\u2019s aging society, bolstering its work force to create economic growth. But, for now, it is increasing budgetary pressure on already stretched governments and causing political ructions within the European Union.On Friday, for example, Hungary closed its border with Croatia, another European Union member, in an effort to stop the flow of people arriving from Turkey via the Balkans.The refugee crisis is also a factor that could drive Britain to vote for an exit from the European Union, a step that would damage Britain and the rest of the bloc economically. Quitting the European Union could actually make it harder for London to control the movement of asylum seekers because it would get less cooperation from its former partners. But euro-skeptics are spuriously saying the opposite \u2014 and seem to be persuading the British people that they have a point.The European Union has finally woken up to these threats. The centerpiece of its policy is an action plan the European Commission agreed on with Turkey on Thursday, and which European Union leaders endorsed at their summit meeting that evening. The snag is that the very next day, Turkey poured cold water on the plan, saying the proposal hadn\u2019t taken final shape.The action plan \u2014 even if only a draft \u2014 is a step in the right direction.Its goal is to ensure that refugees who arrive in Turkey stay there rather than head to the European Union.Europe is dangling various carrots to persuade Ankara to sign up to such a policy: money to help with the influx of migrants; the gradual liberalization of visas for Turkish citizens visiting the European Union; and a re-energizing of Turkey\u2019s bid to join the bloc.It may be that some such deal can eventually be done. But Ankara is understandably trying to extract the best terms.For example, the commission initially promised 500 million euros, or nearly $570 million. After the Turks made clear that wasn\u2019t enough, the European Union leaders discussed a larger, \u20ac3 billion sum \u2014 which Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said seemed reasonable given that Ankara itself had spent \u20ac7 billion addressing the crisis. The Turkish foreign minister, though, then said the country needed at least \u20ac3 billion in just the first year \u2014 the implication being that the total bill could be much bigger.Meanwhile, Mr. Erdogan accused the European Union of insincerity in promising to revive talks on Turkish membership. He is right to be skeptical.Admitting any country to the European Union requires the unanimous approval of all of its member countries, which now number 28. There doesn\u2019t seem much chance of getting such overwhelming support to bring in Turkey with its 78 million, mainly Muslim, people, given the rise of anti-immigration and anti-Muslim sentiment in parts of the bloc.Europe\u2019s approach to Turkey has been one of paying insufficient attention to the country, followed by panic. It isn\u2019t just that the draft action plan was rushed; Ms. Merkel also went to Istanbul for talks with Mr. Erdogan on Sunday, a move that could be seen as interfering in the upcoming election.Now is not the right time to negotiate a comprehensive deal with Ankara. The European Union would do better to wait until after the elections \u2014 at which point it would be clear whether it would be dealing with Mr. Erdogan or a less authoritarian cross-party coalition.Either way, Europe will have to offer Turkey a better deal than it has to date. But, hopefully, it will do so in a way that respects the democratic values that are at the European Union\u2019s core.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "For Canada, Most Noticeable Change Under Justin Trudeau Could Be Tone", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trudeau has promised some major policy changes, among them legalizing marijuana, dropping out of the American-led bombing campaign against the Islamic State and deficit spending to pump up the economy and rebuild infrastructure.But the most noticeable difference will probably be in tone. Mr. Trudeau has been promising since he took over his floundering party in 2013 that he would put an end to Mr. Harper\u2019s often belligerent style of politics and diplomacy.\u201cSunny ways\u201d are Mr. Trudeau\u2019s ways, he said in his victory speech early on Tuesday, borrowing the phrase from Wilfrid Laurier, a Liberal prime minister of about a century ago.\u201cA positive, optimistic, hopeful vision of public life isn\u2019t a na\u00efve dream \u2014 it can be a powerful force for change,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, his voice faltering after 78 days of campaigning. And he said the sweeping victory his party won on Monday as it surged from third place in opinion polls to a clear majority in Parliament meant that \u201cCanadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight: It\u2019s time for change in this country, my friends, real change.\u201dThe Liberals won only 39.5 percent of the popular vote on Monday. But with three major parties and several minor ones jockeying for support, it was enough for a sweeping victory in Parliament, as the Conservatives demonstrated in 2011 when they won about the same share.On Tuesday, during his first news conference since the vote result, Mr. Trudeau said he had told President Obama by telephone that he would honor a campaign pledge to remove Canada\u2019s military jets from the American-led military campaign against the Islamic State group.But Mr. Trudeau declined to say when the aircraft would leave. The two men also discussed Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plans for improving Canada\u2019s record on greenhouse gas emissions, he said. The president, Mr. Trudeau added, teased him about his lack of gray hair and suggested that his new position might soon change that.An Obama administration official, insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of communications between the leaders, said the White House still hoped to find a way for Canada to play a role in the mission.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s showing was the Liberals\u2019 best in 40 years and re-established the party as a national force, rather than one that relied heavily on one province, Ontario, for support. They drew votes away not only from the Conservatives, but also from the New Democrats, the other major opposition party of the center-left. The New Democrats, who led in the polls early in the campaign, wound up losing more than half their seats in Parliament, as well as any hope that the Liberals would be dependent on their backing to govern.The Liberals swept the Atlantic provinces and more than doubled their seat count in Quebec, where voters had spurned the party in recent elections. They even won two seats and came close to taking a third in Calgary, Alberta, Mr. Harper\u2019s adopted hometown and the center of Canadian conservatism. The last time the Liberals won a seat there was in 1968, when the country was swept up in enthusiasm for Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.Justin Trudeau shares his father\u2019s good looks but not his demeanor. He does not flash the scalpel-sharp intelligence his father was known for, but neither does he display the sometimes acerbic nature that went with it. As a result, he has often been underestimated.Before Mr. Trudeau took over the party leadership, Mr. Harper and the Conservatives won three straight national elections against weak Liberal opponents who proved vulnerable to the Conservatives\u2019 heavy reliance on attack advertisements.In 2006, Paul Martin, then the prime minister, was saddled with the legacy of a fund-raising scandal left by his predecessor, Jean Chr\u00e9tien. Next up was St\u00e9phane Dion, a highly respected intellectual from Quebec who came across as somewhat pedantic and failed to counter Conservative ads claiming that a Liberal plan for a carbon tax would be economically disastrous.In 2011, the party was led by Michael Ignatieff, who had spent most of his adult life as an intellectual and a journalist in the United States and Britain before returning home. The Conservatives successfully painted him as an opportunist.Mr. Harper\u2019s party relentlessly attacked Mr. Trudeau during this campaign as well, portraying him as something of a dimwit who had \u201cnice hair\u201d but was \u201cjust not ready\u201d to lead the country. But this time, the strategy flopped.Though Mr. Trudeau said repeatedly that he did not want to trade on his family\u2019s name, growing up in the public gaze did mean that when he entered politics in 2007, he was already a celebrity with a reservoir of public good will to tap. The Conservative attack ads did not just fail to shake that good will; some analysts say they backfired by creating sympathy for Mr. Trudeau.After his party\u2019s defeat on Monday, Mr. Harper resigned as Conservative party leader, but not in the orthodox manner. He made no mention of his intention during his concession speech, leaving his party to announce the news in a brief statement.Mr. Harper\u2019s legacy includes reuniting the Conservative movement under a single party banner by merging his Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives. Under Mr. Harper, the party also developed an effective fund-raising machine.Canadian law bans corporations and unions from making political donations, and imposes fairly low limits on personal donations. So the Conservatives used sophisticated software to develop and promote political issues that would draw large numbers of small donations from supporters, even if they found little support in the rest of the population.The targeted approach was successful financially, but it may also explain why the Conservatives never significantly widened their support during a decade in power. The kinds of issues it led Mr. Harper to promote, like banning the wearing of face coverings by Muslim women at citizenship ceremonies, drew angry reactions that may have contributed to the government\u2019s defeat in the election.The front-runner to succeed Mr. Harper as Conservative leader is Jason Kenney, the departing defense minister and one of the few party figures who had some free rein in Mr. Harper\u2019s highly centralized administration. Mr. Kenney acknowledged late Monday that issues he championed for the government, including the face-veil ban and the antiterrorism measures, might have created the opening that Mr. Trudeau seized to win.\u201cWe need a conservatism that is sunnier and more optimistic than what we have sometimes conveyed,\u201d Mr. Kenney said. \u201cWe have to take collective responsibility for that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Wilfrid Laurier, the Canadian statesman whose phrase \u201csunny ways\u201d Justin Trudeau borrowed in his victory speech. Mr. Laurier was Canada\u2019s second Liberal prime minister, not its first. (The first was Alexander Mackenzie.)Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Election Shakes Assumptions on Departing Leader\u2019s Clout", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the race to succeed Mrs. Kirchner, both Mr. Macri, who is proposing economic shifts to reduce protectionism, and Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer endorsed by the president, scrambled on Monday to reposition their campaigns. Both need voters who opted for other candidates, opening a frenetic new phase in Argentine politics before the runoff election on Nov. 22.Pollsters had cast Mr. Scioli as the front-runner, but momentum appeared to be shifting to Mr. Macri, especially after a rising star in his party, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal, the deputy mayor of Buenos Aires, defeated An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s cabinet chief, in the governor\u2019s race in Buenos Aires Province.In obtaining control of the province, a coveted stronghold, Mr. Macri\u2019s party, called Let\u2019s Change, not only defeated one of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s top supporters. The result was also seen as a referendum on Mr. Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires Province since 2007.Political analysts paid particular attention because voting preferences in the province have historically foretold important shifts in Argentine politics.\u201cThe candidate who has best interpreted the moment is Macri,\u201d said Carlos Germano, an independent analyst. \u201cHe needs to keep pointing toward dialogue and harmony,\u201d he said, predicting that Mr. Macri would meet with leaders of the other opposition parties to solicit their support.Mr. Scioli took 36.9 percent of the vote, compared with 34.3 percent for Mr. Macri in the first round \u2014 an unexpectedly slim margin that astounded many Argentines. Mr. Macri ran a largely nonconfrontational campaign in which he obtained high levels of support in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina\u2019s second-largest city.\u201cIt utterly surprised me,\u201d Jorge Vargas, 65, who polishes floors for a living in Buenos Aires, said of the results. \u201cI voted for Scioli because I don\u2019t like Macri\u2019s background. He\u2019s completely bourgeois.\u201dStill, political analysts lauded Mr. Macri\u2019s attempts to soften his patrician image by trying to appeal to some in Peronism, the ideologically flexible political movement that has held sway in Argentina for decades. Governing Argentina for the last eight years, Mrs. Kirchner repositioned her faction of Peronism to enhance the role of the state in the economy and increase antipoverty spending, while stepping up attacks on critics.But with his strong showing, attention shifted on Monday to Mr. Macri, 56, who was raised in one of Argentina\u2019s wealthiest families and gained prominence as the president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina\u2019s most popular soccer clubs. He is running to the right of Mr. Scioli, but he has emphasized that he would seek to maintain some of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s policies on social spending.Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.Reacting to the runoff outcome, Agust\u00edn Rossi, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s defense minister, told reporters that the president\u2019s supporters needed to \u201cbe humble\u201d in mobilizing a response to Mr. Macri\u2019s rise. Mr. Rossi conceded that Mr. Macri had run a smooth campaign, highlighted by alluring \u201csound bites,\u201d but he said Mr. Macri could end up eroding social welfare benefits.His father, Franco Macri, 85, assembled a business empire involved in construction and car manufacturing. Sometimes openly dismissive of his son\u2019s political ambitions, Franco Macri said last year that his son had \u201cthe brain to be president, but not the heart,\u201d explaining that he believed Argentina\u2019s next president had to come from the radical wing of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political movement.Both Mr. Macri and Mr. Scioli must attract more voters, especially those who opted for Sergio Massa, a former ally of Mrs. Kirchner who took 21.3 percent of the vote, and those who supported small leftist parties.After avoiding a debate before the first round of voting, Mr. Scioli said on Monday that he would accept a debate with Mr. Macri, reflecting how the candidate endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner now finds himself on the defensive. Both candidates have avoided the president\u2019s belligerent tone in favor of a more mollifying approach.In reaction to a potential shift if Mr. Macri\u2019s momentum builds, Argentine stocks surged on Monday. But analysts said such sentiment failed to reflect the possibility of a bruising runoff campaign. Moreover, Mr. Macri recognizes that he must attract supporters of Mr. Scioli, a challenging aim in what remains a highly polarized society.Some voters were perplexed by the runoff. \u201cScioli\u2019s no good; he\u2019s under Cristina\u2019s thumb,\u201d said Mary Dany Correa, 82, a retired civil servant who voted for Mr. Massa. \u201cMacri\u2019s done good things in the city, but I don\u2019t see him as capable of running the whole country. There are a lot of things to fix.\u201dBut Mr. Macri\u2019s showing uplifted many supporters who want a change after 12 years of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor, her late husband, Nestor Kirchner.Santiago Elizalde, 27, an information technology salesman who voted for Mr. Macri, said that while he was ecstatic that his candidate had upended the race, \u201cit\u2019s a match he still has to play.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018How the Other Half Banks,\u2019 by Mehrsa Baradaran", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 1890 the journalist Jacob Riis published \u201cHow the Other Half Lives,\u201d a powerful indictment of the horrific tenements of New York that gave rise to a significant housing reform movement. Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of Georgia law professor, reaches for a similar impact in her description of the oppressive financial environment that low-income families inhabit.The answer to the implicit question contained in her title, \u201cHow the Other Half Banks,\u201d is simple: The \u201cother half\u201d hardly banks at all. Many families below the midline of income distribution in the United States rely heavily on check-\u00adcashing services, payday lenders and title vendors charging fees and interest higher than any chartered bank could legally impose. Financial deregulation enabled banks to slough off low-income customers even as it created new opportunities for storefront profit-taking. People living from paycheck to paycheck, with little surplus to buffer emergencies, occasionally need to borrow money, whatever the interest rate. That rate is typically as high as state laws allow, and short-term loans are designed to encourage rollovers that result in ballooning interest. Payday-loan operations that require borrowers to sign over a share of a future paycheck have proliferated in poor neighborhoods and surround many military bases, as do offers to make short-term loans secured by the title to an automobile. A two-week payday loan with a fee of $15 per $100 \u2014 which Baradaran describes as typical \u2014 is equal to an annual rate of about 400 percent. Poverty is expensive, even for those who aren\u2019t debt-laden. The average family earning $25,000 a year but without a bank account spends about $2,400 a year \u2014 more than it spends on food \u2014 on financial transactions. Even those who manage to open regular bank accounts face disproportionately large fees and harsh penalties for small overdrafts. Some states have been more successful than others at protecting low-income consumers, and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is now providing some oversight. But cross-state comparisons suggest that outright \u00adprohibitions on \u201cfringe banking\u201d don\u2019t necessarily help, because \u00adlow-income families desperately need access to credit, even at high cost.Many critics worry about excessive reliance on finance in the United States. But financialization itself may be less important than the particular form it takes. Baradaran argues persuasively that the banking industry, fattened on public subsidies (including too-big-to-fail bailouts), owes low-income families a better deal. She recounts the slow but steady demise of \u201cbanks with souls\u201d \u2014 the \u00adcommunity-based banks and credit unions that have been displaced by larger institutions better positioned to take advantage of economies of scale. The six largest banks in the United States, she notes, now hold almost 70 percent of all the assets in the financial system. Banking in the past was not nearly as dispiriting. In 1861, Britain mandated provision of basic financial services by local post offices; the United States followed suit in 1910. Postal banking, as it was called, proved particularly beneficial for immigrant families and may also have helped stabilize the financial system in the early years of the Great Depression. Because other regulatory measures seemed to make it superfluous, the program was discontinued in 1966. Today, however, the global financial industry has little incentive to address the needs of low-income families. The time has come, Baradaran argues, either to restore a postal banking system that \u00adoffers greater accessibility or provide some \u00adother public banking option. If only the problems she describes were as photogenic as the ones Jacob Riis dramatized. \u201cHow the Other Half Banks\u201d is well researched and clearly written, but its academic heft demands a long attention span. To be sure, it does speak effectively to another issue. The bankers who fully understand the system are heavily invested in it. Books like this are written for the rest of us.

{"Headline": "Even the Issues Are in Debate in 2016 Race", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one portrait of the nation put forward at the recent Republican presidential debates, America\u2019s moral core is rotting, its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses for profit.In the alternate reality described at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, counteracting climate change and protecting African-Americans from police shootings are the most pressing moral imperatives.Republican candidates say capitalism is buckling under high taxes, regulations and social welfare programs. Democrats question capitalism itself, saying Wall Street and the super-rich are starving the middle class of hope.The right has portrayed the southern border as something like a zombie movie, swarming with murderous Mexicans. On the left, illegal immigrants look like hard workers who deserve a path to citizenship.One of the most striking takeaways from the first two Republican debates and Tuesday\u2019s first Democratic debate is that the two parties do not just disagree on solutions to domestic and foreign policy issues \u2014 they do not even agree on what the issues are. Offering radically different assessments of the challenges people face, and diametrically opposing policy agendas, the candidates could have been campaigning on different continents.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.The jumble of policy differences and priorities reflects the lack of a single dominant issue galvanizing both parties in the 2016 race. The economy was the overriding issue in the presidential elections of 1992, 2008, and 2012, which Democrats won. The Iraq war was the fulcrum in 2004, when George W. Bush was re-elected. The 1996 and 2000 campaigns were largely referendums on Bill Clinton; a strengthening economy and a stolid Republican opponent helped him win re-election, while his vice president, Al Gore, struggled in 2000 to embrace Mr. Clinton\u2019s economic record but disown the scandal that threatened his presidency.This time around, there is a political vacuum to fill. With no dominant issue to run on or against, and no incumbent seeking re-election, the candidates must first persuade voters to accept their diagnoses before selling them on their prescriptions.On foreign policy, for instance, Republican contenders portray the United States as a weakling in the eyes of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin (though they do not have clear strategies for dealing with him beyond tough talk or the silent treatment). Democrats see Mr. Putin as overcompensating, exerting military might in Syria to save face for Russia\u2019s poor economy and misadventures elsewhere (but they, too, are torn: Mrs. Clinton said she would confront him like a bully; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would wait for Russians to grow angry at Mr. Putin over their battlefield casualties).\u201cGiven that the Republicans are the party out of power and lack a single major issue, they are casting around for domestic problems and global threats to energize their voters and build enough support to win back the White House,\u201d said Linda L. Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth who studies political leadership.This challenge is exacerbated by the size of the Republican field, with 15 candidates, she said.\u201cWith so many people, voters can\u2019t easily make sense of the complicated political world,\u201d Ms. Fowler said. \u201cSo the Republicans try to stand out with sharply worded sound bites because those are more memorable \u2014 even if they create more of a divide between candidates and parties.\u201dThe tone of the two parties\u2019 candidates is sharply at odds, too. Democrats on Tuesday were more optimistic, talking of clean energy and debt-free public college, while expressing impatience with the pace of progress on raising the minimum wage and changing campaign finance rules.Republicans, who barely touched on those issues in their debates on Aug. 6 and Sept. 16, sounded dark notes about same-sex marriage, China, the Iranian nuclear deal and the \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d that is the Affordable Care Act. And they were more likely than the Democrats to point fingers at one another \u2014 and to attack their leading candidate, Donald J. Trump \u2014 while finding fault with President Obama and his policies.\u201cThe Democrats are looking ahead toward tomorrow and trying to determine what we should do, while the Republicans are looking at today and talking about what\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Ben Barnes, a Texas Democrat and major party donor. \u201cThere are understandable reasons for both. But the debates give off a feeling of deep division that isn\u2019t healthy for a strong country.\u201dFrank Luntz, a Republican strategist who conducted focus groups during the debates, said that his participants, from both parties, shared \u201ca concurrent feeling of helplessness and the desire to have an impact on the presidential race and the country\u2019s future.\u201d He said Republicans were more critical of one another.\u201cAs of now, the Democrats are set to emerge from the primaries far more unified,\u201d Mr. Luntz said. \u201cIf anything, the Democratic debate should be a wake-up call to Republicans to pay attention to just how divisive and negative they are acting.\u201dTony Kushner, whose screenplay about an earlier American divide earned him an Oscar nomination for the 2012 film \u201cLincoln,\u201d said the bellicose language and anti-establishment themes at the Republican debates \u2014 that government is bad and elected officials are suspect \u2014 put the country \u201cin a very perilous place,\u201d because the candidates appeared to be abandoning policy making and governing.\u201cLincoln was effective in explaining war and sacrifice to Americans because of the lawyerly structure of his thought, the pithiness and clarity and wit and measured cadences of his pronouncements, and the lack of any kind of inflammatory rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Kushner said.\u201cIssues facing the country are always complicated,\u201d he added, \u201cbut talking about them calmly and clearly is a crucial part of leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Mining\u2019s Promise Falls Through for Remote Australian Town", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDunedoo JournalDUNEDOO, Australia \u2014 A flock of pink and gray galahs takes flight over the sports field, but Mark Gallagher does not see them.Gazing out over the field, soft and verdant in the late afternoon sun, he sees last year\u2019s rugby league team, the Dunedoo Swans, battling the Coonamble Bears for the district title, the Castlereagh Cup. It was a perfect spring afternoon and the Swans, which Mr. Gallagher managed, had their best team in years, the pride of this agricultural hamlet about 200 miles northwest of Sydney.Farm gates for miles around were festooned then with \u201cGo Dunedoo\u201d signs. Cars packed the grounds and spectators clambered on the beds of two truck trailers that served as makeshift grandstands to cheer on their team. The Swans triumphed, 32 to 12, taking the cup for the first time in 47 years.This year, Dunedoo does not even have enough players to field a team.\u201cIt is the saddest thing,\u201d said Mr. Gallagher, 46. \u201cAfter winning the grand final, they couldn\u2019t run onto the field this year to contest the cup. We couldn\u2019t find a coach, and we didn\u2019t have the young men. They left.\u201dEven before its population declined, Dunedoo was never all that much: a speck of a red-dirt town with one main street, a single grocery store, a newsstand and a pub. Yellow daisies sprout like weeds through its grass verges, and towering old gums and weathered pepper trees line the center of its country roads.Dunedoo (pronounced DUN-ee-doo) is an Aboriginal word meaning black swan. A town landmark is the epic, misshapen rubber fowl mounted on the roof of Dunedoo\u2019s single motel, The Swan. Known for its ranches of prizewinning merino sheep and stud cattle, Dunedoo seemed to its residents like the kind of place that would never change.In 2008, the New South Wales government announced plans to build a coal mine here, promising jobs and cheap power. The coal business was booming because of demand from China. The government bought up 177 square miles of land for the mine project, boarding up 114 farms and homes.Since then, coal prices have plummeted to their lowest level in years and the government has not been able to find a mining company willing to open a mine here. In 2013, the government abandoned its plans to develop the mine and last December appointed Goldman Sachs to sell the land.By then, the district had lost 95 families, about 10 percent of its population. A sense of loss pervades the town, and residents feel blindsided by forces beyond their control.\u201cIt is dreadful,\u201d said Trish Booth, who owns the 5-Star Supermarket. \u201cThat mine took families off farms. They used to come in here to buy their groceries and small luxuries. Not anymore. I\u2019m fighting tooth and nail to keep my business going.\u201dBarry Evans, 85, a retired sheep farmer who now lives in town, said plans for the mine had divided the community. Some people wanted the jobs and revenue the mine would bring, but others feared coal dust in the air and an ugly open wound in the earth across the district\u2019s pristine pastures.\u201cBut then it doesn\u2019t come, well, that\u2019s a big loss to the businesspeople here,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIt is a poor state of standing for the town.\u201dLike many residents, he remembers better times, like the night of wild dancing in his wool shed in 2001, an event that drew three-quarters of the town and raised around $5,600 to build housing for older Australians. \u201cI got to bed at 3 a.m.,\u201d he said with smile.\u201cI love Dunedoo and all the things I\u2019ve done here,\u201d he said. But now he worries about its future.As the government closed farms, the local school lost 25 children and has switched to a smaller school bus. A third of Dunedoo\u2019s population is over 60 years old.\u201cNone of my children live here,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cThey could see bigger things they could apply their education to outside the town.\u201dLou Armstrong, 62, a third-generation sheep breeder, said years of uncertainty over the mine had hobbled businesses. Some of the land for the mine has been leased back to farmers, but the short-term leases, he said, discourage investment.\u201cThose pastures won\u2019t be improved,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a loss to the district.\u201dTwo of Mr. Armstrong\u2019s three children returned from city boarding schools to work on the farm, but they worry about the community.\u201cThe whole mining affair didn\u2019t help Dunedoo,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. \u201cIt is very hard keeping the kids here. They love the lifestyle, but if there\u2019s no profit there\u2019s no lifestyle.\u201dThe town has been officially compensated for its loss. The New South Wales state government provided a $5.6 million transition fund to help rejuvenate the economy.Most of the money has been spent. Construction is about to start on a complex of retirement apartments costing $3.1 million. A skate park for the town\u2019s children was built for $99,000. A public bathroom was constructed near a rest stop for truckers, $78,000, and the gravel road there paved with asphalt, $353,000. And there are new lighted courts near the sports field for netball, a game similar to basketball.Residents worry that the new amenities will do little to solve Dunedoo\u2019s enduring problems.\u201cNone of what\u2019s been done here is long term,\u201d said Damien O\u2019Leary, a farmer and vice president of Dunedoo\u2019s agricultural show and fair committee. \u201cThe transition fund hasn\u2019t created industry or jobs.\u201dMr. Gallagher, the manager of the Swans, who owns a small construction firm, said that the town\u2019s committees all had a voice in asking for money but that no one came up with a \u201cbig-bang industry that could help revive Dunedoo.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no work at a skate park, no jobs in retirement living apartments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have built something big out here, an industry. Now, it is too late.\u201dOne business that may benefit from the improvements to the truck stop is the White Rose Caf\u00e9, across the street from it.\u201cWe get the truckers and the gray nomads,\u201d said Karleeta Ryan, 58, who bought the cafe in 2013 with her husband Gerry, 61. Open seven days, early until late, the restaurant, one of two in Dunedoo, serves pulled-pork rolls, lamb pies, beer-battered fish and a bacon, pineapple and banana melt.\u201cWhen I found out the mine had stalled, I asked the council to put a shower into the truck stop across the road,\u201d Ms. Ryan said. \u201cIt sounds silly, but it would have encouraged the truck drivers to stop for a little longer.\u201dAs the cafe\u2019s tables filled, she rinsed coffee cups and wiped her wet hands on her apron. \u201cSometimes when one door shuts, another one opens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are waiting.\u201dAmong the young people who have not returned to Dunedoo is Tom Yeo, 27, the former captain and star of the victorious Dunedoo Swans. He moved to Dubbo, a bigger town, where he could find work as a plumber.He still thinks about that warm September day and how that one game on that one afternoon brought the entire town together.\u201cThis was the culmination of everything for the town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was crazy, to see so many people there. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. Everyone got caught up in the passion. It peaked for us with that grand final.\u201dStill, he said, Dunedoo is blessed.\u201cSmall towns are dying,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are good families in town who work hard.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified Mark Gallagher, a builder who managed the Dunedoo Swans. He is sitting at right, not left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Culture of Nagging Helps California Save Water", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the most effective enforcers may be closer to home: the domestic water police.They are the moms and dads, spouses and partners, children, even co-workers and neighbors who are quick to wag a finger when they spot people squandering moisture, such as a faucet left running while they\u2019re brushing their teeth, or using too much water to clean dinner plates in the sink. And showers? No lingering allowed.So discovered Dick Allen, a retired businessman in San Francisco, who tells of getting busted recently by his wife. He\u2019d just stepped into a hot shower to loosen up after a workout when she appeared in the bathroom to scold him.\u201c \u2018You\u2019ve been in the shower too long,\u2019 \u201d he recalled her saying. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d he pleaded. She had proof \u2014 his back was red. \u201cIt was the gotcha moment,\u201d said Mr. Allen, who occasionally jokes with his younger wife that she has \u201cjunior water rights\u201d and therefore can\u2019t shower until the following day.The nanny-state strategy, however, has been helped by the nagging-state approach at home, according to interviews with people across the state. By many accounts, the needling often seems taken in its intended, well-meaning spirit. But it isn\u2019t always welcomed, particularly when it comes from someone outside the inner family circle.That led to an awkward moment for J. S. Gilbert and his wife recently during a gathering at their house with friends in South San Francisco. One of the visitors used the bathroom and, Mr. Gilbert happened to notice, didn\u2019t flush. So he mentioned this oversight to his friend, who \u201clooked me straight in the eye and said, \u2018If it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Gilbert, who works as a consultant to advertising agencies.\u201cI said, \u2018I think that\u2019s O.K. if that\u2019s you and your wife at home,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gilbert responded, which invited another riposte from his visitor. \u201cHe said: \u2018That\u2019s up to you. I\u2019m doing what I can to save water.\u2019 \u201dWater shaming has plenty of precursors. Public safety advocates, for instance, have said that greater use of seatbelts, and a drop in drunken driving episodes nationwide, can be traced in part to friends and family members giving offenders a mouthful.Drought is not new to California. Indeed most of its residents have been living with it for years, making them experts in conservation. We asked our readers in California how they have adapted to a life with less water. Here are some of their suggestions and tips on how to live with drought.But Dr. Michael said Californians\u2019 willingness to nudge one another could change the collective mind-set toward water.In Dr. Michael\u2019s own household, outside Sacramento, the water cop duties are divided. He handles the lawn, while his wife oversees the showers. But Dr. Michael said the different roles betrayed a subtext in water policing: People use the drought to press their own agendas.For instance, he likes cutting back on watering partly because he hates lawn care. And he thinks his wife is tough on shower time because she would really like family members to be more efficient in all things. \u201cShe wants people to get ready faster,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou can use the drought to sort of hasten or further our alternative goals.\u201dSome Californians police colleagues at work to, say, toss a half-drunk cup of water on a plant and not down the drain. Some residents hear it from their children; Robin Wolaner, an executive at a nonprofit in San Francisco, got an earful from her teenage daughter because she was shaving her legs in the shower with the water running. Shaving without running water? \u201cUncivilized,\u201d Ms. Wolaner said in an interview. But she found little support from friends on Facebook, so she now shaves with the taps off.Others are weighing how appropriate it is to nag a neighbor. For instance, Nick Desai, the chief executive of a health care start-up and a resident of Pacific Palisades, said he had been thinking of a proper way to tell his new neighbors that they should revisit their sprinkler strategy.\u201cI think I\u2019ll wait another two weeks and I\u2019ll knock on the door and say, \u2018At night I can see the sprinklers from our bedroom, and they\u2019re mostly watering the patio,\u2019 \u201d he said.Many people report that policing pits generations against each other. Parents, especially, say they can have trouble getting through to smaller children who think of water as just plain fun. And how exactly to counter years of programming that children need to bathe every night?\u201cThe pendulum has swung from filthy boys needing a bath twice a day to, \u2018Does he really need a bath?\u2019 \u201d said Dave Donohue, a San Franciscan who has reduced bathing for his son Milo, 2, and also concedes chiding his wife and his colleagues if they toss a glass of drinking water into the sink.The habit has caught on elsewhere. Tara Lindis, a writer in Brooklyn, said she had used California\u2019s dry spell as a teaching moment for her children. For example, when they were having a water fight in the backyard this summer, she said she told them, \u201cDon\u2019t dump that bucket! Kids in California can\u2019t have water balloon fights like you! They don\u2019t get baths!\u201dWhat goes around comes around. The other day, her son, who is almost 7, admonished her: \u201cThat was a long shower.\u201dSometimes you just can\u2019t win with the water cops. Mr. Gilbert, the ad agency consultant in South San Francisco, was told by another friend (not the one who declined to flush at his party) that he needed to replace the old toilet in his house because it used too much water.Eventually, after being hectored for a few months, he relented and replaced the toilet. Unfortunately, the new low-flow toilet, which was white, no longer matched the old green sink and tub. So Mr. Gilbert replaced the sink, and enameled the tub himself, spending $2,500 for the new fixtures and plumbing, plus his own enameling time.The next time the friend came over, Mr. Gilbert showed off his efforts. \u201cI said, \u2018Are you happy I replaced the toilet?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well, at this point, I\u2019m not sure we have to worry so much, we\u2019re going to have El Ni\u00f1o.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Allies See Trans-Pacific Partnership as a Check on China", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal was welcomed on Tuesday as a win for the United States in its contest with China for clout in Asia, as America\u2019s allies expressed optimism about the impact of the 12-nation accord on a region worried about its dependence on the slowing Chinese economy.The pact still must win approval in Congress, and analysts said the economic effects may be less sweeping than Washington predicts. But the mere fact that President Obama delivered on his pledge to close the deal came as a relief to allies in Asia. It was seen as a counterweight to China\u2019s efforts to expand its influence not just in trade but in other areas, including its island-building in the disputed South China Sea and the establishment of a new regional development bank to compete with Western-led institutions.\u201cThe TPP may not be the game-changer the Americans say it will be, but if the TPP failed, it would certainly have been a blow to U.S. credibility, and its conclusion is to be welcomed,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, a former permanent secretary of Singapore\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Yet, he cautioned: \u201cThis is not going to erode what China does.\u201dThe victory for the United States comes as China\u2019s position in Asia has been thrown off balance by questions about the condition of its economy, which is expanding at its slowest pace in a quarter century and has sent tremors across the region. Even with the slowdown, though, the Chinese economy is growing faster than those of most industrial nations, and China enjoys deepening economic ties with almost all countries in the region.The trade agreement is unlikely to change that, but it is an important symbol of America\u2019s staying power in Asia, some experts said. \u201cIt does at least temporarily halt the seemingly inexorable waning of U.S. influence and the corresponding rise of Chinese influence in the Asian region,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of international economics at Cornell University and former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund.Since 2011, when President Obama told the Australian Parliament that the United States would play a \u201clarger and long-term role\u201d in shaping the Asian region, its allies have been waiting for results. For a while, the much-extolled \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia seemed to be mostly a verbal one \u2014 and one intended to antagonize China, by proposing to bolster America\u2019s military presence and creating a trade zone that kept China out.\u201cThe China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China now provide more loans to the region than the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank combined,\u201d the report said. Indeed, although the TPP is seen mainly as an enterprise that aims to knit the United States and Asia closer together, three of its 12 members are in Latin America: Chile, Mexico and Peru.In terms of trade competition with China in Asia, the deal would advantage American firms over Chinese firms \u201conly very slightly,\u201d since there is very little overlap in the range of goods each country exports to Asian members of the accord, said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.In China, where the government\u2019s initial opposition to the trade pact has softened recently, the Ministry of Commerce issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the accord was \u201cone of the important free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d Early in the negotiations, Beijing criticized the pact as an American effort to contain China, an argument that is still frequently heard from Chinese analysts.\u201cInitial Chinese hostility toward TPP has moderated dramatically,\u201d Mr. Lardy said. But if China contemplated becoming a member, as some reform-minded Chinese economists have suggested, the government would need to work harder at economic reform in order to meet the pact\u2019s standards, Mr. Lardy said.In a surprising statement in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose relations with China have been poor, suggested China should become a member of the pact. \u201cIf China joined TPP in the future,\u201d Mr. Abe said, \u201cit would contribute greatly to our country\u2019s security and the stability of the Asia-Pacific region, and that would have an extremely large strategic significance.\u201dBut Peter Drysdale, emeritus professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, said it was almost certain that China would stay outside the TPP, and therefore work even harder at cementing its economic ties in East Asia through other means.\u201cEven with growth two or three percentage points lower than its current rate, there\u2019s not a major business anywhere in the region, including in Japan, that doesn\u2019t have to factor China in,\u201d Mr. Drysdale said. \u201cWith China out of TPP for the foreseeable future, the incentive for China and its East Asian partners to ramp up their economic ties will be more powerful.\u201dAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, greeted the deal with enthusiasm, saying it offered \u201cunprecedented new opportunities\u201d for new markets in Asia and Latin America, as Australia faced the end of its mining boom. Mr. Turnbull, a proponent of close ties with Beijing, did not mention China in his comments.Mr. Abe also hailed the accord, saying, \u201cThe curtain is finally rising on a new Asian century.\u201d Japan was a latecomer to the negotiations, joining only in 2013, and demands by its influential farm lobby that it keep in place tariffs on rice, beef, milk and other agricultural products proved to be one of several major stumbling blocks.Mr. Abe championed the deal against considerable domestic opposition, including from many members of his own conservative party, large numbers of whom represent rural constituencies. But Japan\u2019s Parliament was widely expected to approve the accord.Although the conclusion of the negotiations were broadly welcomed among America\u2019s friends in Asia, the United States should not view Asian nations as wanting to decide between Washington and Beijing, Mr. Kausikan said.\u201cNo one sees the TPP as an alternative to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. is important, and China is important. We\u2019re capable of doing things simultaneously. China is a huge economic factor that cannot be wished away.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously included one country among a list of Latin American members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and misstated the total number of members from the region. Chile, Mexico and Peru are members, but not Colombia, and three of the 12 members, not four, are from Latin America.Michael D.

{"Headline": "Message From China\u2019s Leader, Xi Jinping, to North Korea May Signal Thaw", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Relations between China and North Korea showed some signs on Saturday of thawing after a deep chill, as President Xi Jinping of China sent a warm note to the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and sent one of his most senior officials to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Mr. Kim\u2019s ruling party.The official, Liu Yunshan, stood next to Mr. Kim during much of an elaborate military parade in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and the two chatted frequently. Mr. Liu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Politburo, is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the North since Mr. Kim rose to power in late 2011.Upon arriving on Friday night for a four-day visit, Mr. Liu met with Mr. Kim and gave him Mr. Xi\u2019s message, in a meeting that was widely covered in Chinese state news media. In the message, Mr. Xi said he not only extended the congratulations of the Chinese Communist Party but sent his own personal good wishes. He hailed Mr. Kim for having achieved \u201cpositive progress in developing the economy, improving livelihoods, and so on.\u201dDespite its concerns about the North\u2019s nuclear program, China has not used its full economic leverage to discourage the North from pursuing it, apparently being more concerned about potential instability in the North that could spill into its territory. China\u2019s economic largess keeps North Korea\u2019s bare-bones economy afloat, but a debate has been roiling in the past year among Chinese military officials and academics over whether its ally is more a liability than an asset.A Chinese expert on North Korea, Yang Xiyu, said that the tone of Mr. Xi\u2019s letter to Mr. Kim was fairly standard for a message from Beijing to Pyongyang on the occasion of a major anniversary.\u201cSuch official wordings are always the same no matter whether the bilateral relationship is in good shape or bad shape,\u201d said Mr. Yang, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s a routine action.\u201dBut John Delury, an associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, said Mr. Xi seemed to have used the military parade on Saturday \u2014 apparently the biggest celebration in the North since Mr. Xi took power \u2014 as an occasion to mend fences with the North, at least to a degree.\u201cXi\u2019s letter marks the Chinese leader\u2019s first real effort to make friends with Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Delury said. \u201cThe fulsome praise of the Kim dynasty is new for Xi, whose administration has sounded guarded, even irritated, in its language toward Pyongyang.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pope\u2019s Confounding Consistency", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHAS the cool pope left the building?For days after the revelation that Pope Francis met the Kentucky county clerk and anti-gay-marriage activist Kim Davis during his visit to Washington, church officials would neither confirm nor deny that it had happened, allowing Ms. Davis\u2019s claim that the pope \u201cvalidates\u201d her actions to stand.Only on Friday did a Vatican spokesman say that the encounter \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects.\u201d Intended to \u201ccontribute to an objective understanding of what transpired,\u201d the Vatican statement raised as many questions as it answered. Whether the pope knew in advance that he would be meeting Ms. Davis was shrouded in an almost confessional silence.After a heady tour in which Francis had praised icons of the Catholic left like Dorothy Day before Congress, the Davis affair smacked of inconsistency and betrayal. Concerned pope watchers walked the formerly smitten back from the brink. In Esquire, Charles Pierce worried that the pontiff had been \u201cswindled\u201d into the meeting, while the National Catholic Reporter\u2019s Michael Sean Winters argued that mistakes were made, and the church should just admit it.Others soft-pedaled the meeting\u2019s significance. \u201cNot to put too fine a point on it,\u201d the Jesuit author James Martin quipped, \u201cbut Pope Francis also met Mark Wahlberg, and that does not mean that he liked \u2018Ted.\u2019 \u201dYet if in this analogy Mark Wahlberg is Kim Davis, and \u201cTed\u201d is Ms. Davis\u2019s refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, it\u2019s entirely possible that Pope Francis did like \u201cTed.\u201d His past behavior suggests that he may have liked \u201cTed\u201d a lot.While it should go without saying that the leader of the Roman Catholic Church hews unflaggingly to its opposition to same-sex marriage, his previous comments that the church should \u201cconsider\u201d civil unions and the warm welcome he gave to a same-sex couple in Washington raised the hopes of many. Before the world began to parse his every utterance, however, he went further on the issue than his current above-the-fray persona allows.As recently as 2009, he dealt with the legal and political implications of same-sex marriage so unambiguously as to suggest there was nothing of a swindle or a mistake about his appointment with Ms. Davis. As Argentina\u2019s legalization of same-sex marriage approached six years ago, the mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, currently a candidate for the presidency, declined to appeal when a judge\u2019s ruling allowed the marriage of two men to proceed. The future Pope Francis, then archbishop of Buenos Aires, publicly objected to the mayor\u2019s failure as a \u201cguardian of the law.\u201d \u201cThe Constitution and national codes cannot be modified by a judge,\u201d he said. In such situations, he insisted, officials had a responsibility to act.\u201cIt was the first time in 18 years as bishop that I criticized a government official,\u201d he later said. Within church circles, he spoke more vehemently as the national same-sex marriage bill moved toward a vote. \u201cLet us not be na\u00efve,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Carmelite nuns in his diocese. \u201cThis is not simply a political struggle, but it is an attempt to destroy God\u2019s plan.\u201dIt is tempting to see in the pope\u2019s varied messages during his first visit to the United States the ploys of a seasoned political fighter who knows that a move left on the climate and the economy gives him the space he needs to jab right on social issues. That may be part of it. As the future pope counseled, one should not be na\u00efve. The Vatican was an old hand at international politics before this country was born.Yet another interpretation is far more unsettling to our bifurcated culture: that Pope Francis is a man who sees more similarities than differences between Kim Davis and Dorothy Day.During her protests against the war in Vietnam, Day, too, broke the law, and spoke openly about the need to do so. She professed her willingness to go to prison for her convictions, just as Mr. Huckabee did the day Ms. Davis was released from jail. While Day took action because of war and Ms. Davis did so because of marriage, in the pope\u2019s view, his church\u2019s struggle against same-sex marriage is \u201cGod\u2019s war.\u201dFrancis has said he sees the devil at work in the question of marriage equality; Ms. Davis has said her refusal to grant marriage licenses was \u201ca heaven or hell decision.\u201d Whatever sets them apart, what the pope and the county clerk ultimately have in common is more than a few moments together in Washington.As his papacy continues, Francis will likely infuriate people on both sides of our political divide, but it won\u2019t be because he\u2019s fickle. Cool or uncool, the pope is consistency itself.Advertisement"}

A supporter of Ms. Feng posted a photograph of her and the bloody fetus online, igniting nationwide outrage and leading to the firing of some officials. Even after that, though, Ms. Feng\u2019s husband was beaten on the orders of local officials, who also led farmers in a march to denounce the family as \u201ctraitors.\u201d\u201cThe tragedy that happened to us was because we didn\u2019t have a permit,\u201d the husband, Deng Jiyuan, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that everyone is allowed to have two children now. That is how the policy should always have been, from the very beginning.\u201dThe decision to end the one-child policy came in dull, bureaucratic language. \u201cComprehensively implement a policy that couples can have two children, actively taking steps to counter the aging of the population,\u201d the Communist Party said in a communiqu\u00e9 on Thursday.Those flat words, and their allusion to spurring economic growth, provided the official rationale for transforming a policy that has left cradles empty and hearts hollow across China, scarring generations of families.Ms. Feng\u2019s case was extraordinary in that it seized the attention of many Chinese and galvanized calls, including from officials and policy makers, to end the one-child system.\u201cThe central government, though it didn\u2019t actively advocate for the forceful measures, tacitly approved them because it didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d said Liang Zhongtang, 68, an early adviser to senior officials on family planning who advocated a two-child policy decades ago.And with an average rate of 1.6 births per woman, China is not replacing its population, now at 1.4 billion. The elderly will lack caretakers. The slowing economy is already reflecting the effects of the planning.A look at how China\u2019s restrictions on the size of families changed over the years.\u201cThis policy has had such a big impact on China\u2019s social development, bigger than the Cultural Revolution,\u201d said Yang Zhizhu, a law scholar at the China Youth University of Political Studies in Beijing, who was fined and removed from teaching in 2010 after he and his wife had a second child. \u201cIt\u2019s ruined the demographic structure, both the age and gender structure, and it\u2019s also altered Chinese people\u2019s thinking so that young people are unwilling to bear and raise children.\u201d\u201cIt was the most painful thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Ms. Pan said in a telephone interview on Friday. \u201cI can\u2019t even think about having another baby. My baby was so grown. He was a life. He used to kick in my belly all the time.\u201dThe one-child policy originated with a family planning policy group under the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, that was established in 1973, said Mr. Liang, who wrote a book on the policy\u2019s history. The government had for years been encouraging citizens to have fewer children. But in 1979, party leaders, under the group\u2019s advice, took a bold step, embracing the new approach.Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping, the leaders who succeeded Mao Zedong, and other top party officials \u201call believed the huge population was the major setback in achieving a better economy,\u201d Mr. Liang said.After they enacted the policy, he said, \u201cit spread throughout the country quickly.\u201d\u201cBefore 1979,\u201d he said, \u201cthere were already family planning groups in the party committees from the provincial level on down, so the system was already there.\u201dFive years later, Mr. Liang, a population scholar at the Shanxi Academy of Social Sciences, wrote a letter to Hu Yaobang, then the party\u2019s general secretary, arguing that if families were allowed to have two children, the population could still be kept to 1.2 billion by 2000.Across China, the mainstream policy took hold. Families not exempt from the one-child rule had to pay huge fines if they were found in violation. Employees of the state were fired, and party members were expelled. Some families secretly had \u201cblack\u201d children \u2014 ones never registered at birth.In cities, officials erected billboards that showed beaming couples with a single angelic child. A slogan said, \u201cHave less children and plant more trees.\u201d Signs in the countryside, where farmers wanted more children, tended to be harsher. One example: \u201cRefuse to have an abortion and you will have your house demolished and lose your cattle.\u201dThat severity was reflected in the work of family planning committees and local officials across China, since meeting the targets was seen as a collective responsibility. The targets vary: In some areas, officials are ordered to maintain a certain head count, while in others, it is the number of births or the growth rate that counts.Ms. Birney said she had done a survey in Shandong and Henan Provinces that showed that most village officials believed they would be fired or seriously punished if the family planning target was not met.Whether local officials use harsh, invasive measures often depends on how realistic the population target set from above is, she said. One official taking part in a survey said, \u201cTube-tying and abortions must be completed.\u201d In a village in Jilin Province, Ms. Birney found that officials had posted a chart in a public hall that showed what kinds of birth control different groups of women were using.\u201cThat the state does these very invasive things is not something that is seen as an extreme measure by many officials,\u201d she said.That was the same year that the cases of Ms. Feng and Ms. Pan emerged and angered many people, as photographs of them in hospitals circulated online. Because they were rural residents, Ms. Feng and her husband qualified as exceptions to the one-child rule, but they had failed to get a permit before she got pregnant because of bureaucracy. Even Hu Xijin, editor in chief of Global Times, a nationalistic, state-run newspaper, called what Ms. Feng had endured \u201cbarbaric\u201d in a microblog post, though he also said, \u201cFamily planning has served China rather than harmed it.\u201d\u201cWhat do I think about the new policy?\u201d Ms. Pan asked. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd that the state controls how many babies people have. In Mao\u2019s years, he said, \u2018More people equals greater strength.\u2019 Then came the time they wanted to control the population, and it became \u2018one is enough.\u2019 Now they say you can have two.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.

What is your best memory of the festival?What film would you be most interested in seeing at the festival?I won\u2019t have time to see other films. But if I were here for more than two days, I would want to see Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s \u201cCemetery of Splendour.\u201d But hopefully I\u2019ll get to see the film at another festival.What was the most challenging moment in your shoot?In one scene, the father of the female character Tao passes away unexpectedly in a different town. She receives the news and makes her way there. I at first asked [the actress and Mr. Jia\u2019s wife] Zhao Tao to be very calm and composed. Because to me, that\u2019s how you\u2019re able to take care of all the funeral decisions. But when we were shooting, she didn\u2019t really get into the character. She told me she didn\u2019t feel quite right about the way I wrote the character in that scene. To her, as a Chinese female character having such an intimate relationship with her father, she thought the emotions should be very externalized: to cry and express emotions viscerally. It\u2019s a completely different female perspective on how to deal with someone\u2019s passing, and different from how I would deal with it. I went through a lot of internal struggles with the scene. And I realized it had a lot to do with the way I see, not only from a male\u2019s perspective, but from the Eastern aesthetic. I decided eventually to go for the actual human reactions rather than the Eastern film aesthetic. I changed my direction and had Zhao Tao\u2019s character be a lot more expressive in her grief.What was your primary motivation for making the film?I wanted to investigate human emotions on many different levels within many different relationships. I wanted to think about them like blood in your bloodstream. In your daily life, you don\u2019t feel it flowing in your veins, but when certain situations happen, you will feel a certain influx or outgoing of the blood to your face or certain parts of your body. I wanted to always go back to how you react in certain situations dealing with love, loss and death.How has the film been received in China?The film will be released in theaters in China on Oct. 30. But it was shown in the Shanghai Film Festival in June. After that screening, we got a lot of feedback and reactions. Many loved the film, but at the same time there were people who really felt uncomfortable with what they saw being portrayed. The discomfort they experienced was that, even though the film is very much about the development and growth of the economy in China and how we are better off financially and economically speaking, you do still see poverty and what it\u2019s like to still be living in an impoverished environment. So I think that part is problematic for some people, who think we should just look at the bright side and not at the underbelly of society. But as a filmmaker, no matter what country you\u2019re in, you cannot somehow forget those people \u2014 it\u2019s our duty to capture them with our cameras, and document their lives as well.Advertisement"}

The living area is furnished, and while furnishings are not included in the asking price, they are negotiable. The top floor of the villa has views of Sagami Bay \u2014 there are five beaches in Hayama \u2014 as well as the lush waterside hills of Hayama. The top floor also has a 650-square-foot deck, and the white, clean-lined kitchen has a dishwasher and an oven by Miele.\u00a0The guesthouse atop the cliff has generated a lot of questions about earthquakes, flooding, landslides and the like, according to Chiaki Yamada of Housing Japan, the agency that has the listing. \u00a0\u201cAs it is located right on the beach, it is classified as being in the potentially hazardous zone for tsunamis and landslides that may occur from earthquakes,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, as both houses have at least a concrete foundation, it has stayed sturdy over the years,\u201d and no major damage has occurred.\u00a0Ms. Yamada said that when the current owner renovated the guesthouse in 2009, a test showed that the concrete had actually grown stronger over time. Also, the current owner did a large-scale construction project to strengthen the embankment along the shore, she said.\u00a0The guesthouse also has a 2LDK layout \u2014 it has two bedrooms and a living-dining-kitchen area. In this case, they are all on the same floor, as is the bathroom, which has a tub, sink and toilet. Both levels of the guesthouse are concrete, and the lower level is used for storage. The entrance is on the second level. Floors are black slate from Miyagi prefecture, and walls are covered in striped zebrawood veneer. The kitchen has a Miele dishwasher.\u00a0A section of the property is now used to park up to eight cars, but the area is large enough that another dwelling could also be built on it, Ms. Yamada said. Hayama, which has a population of about 33,000 residents, is about an hour-and-a-half drive from central Tokyo; by public transportation, the trip would be closer to two hours from this house. The area is known for fishing and marine sports, with a marina nearby. Hayama is about an hour\u2019s drive from Haneda Airport and about two hours from Tokyo Narita Airport.\u00a0MARKET OVERVIEWCertain parts of the Japanese housing market are seller\u2019s markets, especially Tokyo.\u00a0The history of the Japanese housing market has been a volatile one. In the 1980s, real estate there was booming because the country was expected to become a major economic center of Asia, said Erik Oskamp, the owner of Akasaka Real Estate in Tokyo. When that didn\u2019t happen, he said, a massive housing bubble popped and home prices fell by about 50 percent, sometimes more, over the next decade.\u00a0James Keane, a senior consultant with Relo Japan, a company that provides moving services to expatriates, said that a lot of holiday homes were built in resort areas throughout Japan in the 1980s and early \u201990s, \u201cand many people found themselves unable to afford to keep them after the economy crashed.\u201d As a result, large numbers of unoccupied holiday homes, particularly apartments, \u201ccan be bought for the equivalent of a few thousand U.S. dollars,\u201d he said. Often, high maintenance fees are the catch, he said. \u00a0Mr. Keane said that traditionally buyers in Japan have wanted new homes, not resales, though that may be beginning to change.\u00a0WHO BUYS IN JAPANBesides Japanese, wealthy Chinese and Taiwanese are most active in buying real estate in Japan at the moment, Mr. Keane said. \u201cIt is seen as a good investment for them.\u201d\u00a0Mr. Oskamp said there were no reliable statistics on foreign home buyers in Japan, but he estimated that perhaps 2 percent to 3 percent of all real estate transactions in Tokyo involve foreign buyers.\u00a0Areas outside Tokyo may attract substantially more foreign buyers with new developments that are heavily promoted outside Japan because they are not selling well to locals, he said.\u00a0BUYING BASICSForeigners face no buying restrictions in Japan. Although it is possible to hire a lawyer, a real estate agent typically does the legal work in standard transactions, while a seller\u2019s agent drafts the contract, agents said. The real estate agent\u2019s commission of about 6 percent is typically split between the buyer and the seller.

That became irrefutably clear last week after Franklin Nieves, one of the lead prosecutors who convicted him, abandoned his post, traveled to the United States and expressed remorse for his role in a travesty of justice. Mr. Nieves said in a video posted on YouTube that he decided to flee Venezuela because he could no longer defend \u201cthe false evidence\u201d that was used to convict the opposition leader. Mr. L\u00f3pez, who was sentenced last month to nearly 14 years in prison for supposedly stoking violent protests in 2014, and is being held in solitary confinement, has filed an appeal. Mr. Nieves has said that he was pressured by government threats to rely on bogus evidence. He urged fellow prosecutors and judges to follow his lead and \u201ctell the whole truth\u201d about the trial.His decision to turn on the Maduro government is another powerful sign that it could be crumbling from within under the weight of a catastrophically managed economic crisis and the president\u2019s bumbling leadership style.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Doctrine of Restraint", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne way to define Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy is as a Doctrine of Restraint. It is clear, not least to the Kremlin, that this president is skeptical of the efficacy of military force, wary of foreign interventions that may become long-term commitments, convinced the era of American-imposed solutions is over, and inclined to see the United States as less an indispensable power than an indispensable partner. He has, in effect, been talking down American power.President Vladimir Putin has seized on this profound foreign policy shift in the White House. He has probed where he could, most conspicuously in Ukraine, and now in Syria. Obama may call this a form of Russian weakness. He may mock Putin\u2019s forays as distractions from a plummeting Russian economy. But the fact remains that Putin has reasserted Russian power in the vacuum created by American retrenchment and appears determined to shape the outcome in Syria using means that Obama has chosen never to deploy. For Putin, it\u2019s clear where the weakness lies: in the White House.Russia\u2019s Syrian foray may be overreach. It may fall into the category of the \u201cstupid stuff\u201d (read reckless intervention) Obama shuns. Quagmires can be Russian, too. But for now the initiative appears to lie in the Kremlin, with the White House as reactive power. Not since the end of the Cold War a quarter-century ago has Russia been as assertive or Washington as acquiescent.Obama\u2019s Doctrine of Restraint reflects circumstance and temperament. He was elected to lead a nation exhausted by the two longest and most expensive wars in its history. Iraq and Afghanistan consumed trillions without yielding victory. His priority was domestic: first recovery from the 2008 meltdown and then a more equitable and inclusive society. The real pivot was not to Asia but to home.Besides, American power in the 21st century could not be what it was in the 20th, not with the Chinese economy quintupling in size since 1990. The president was intellectually persuaded of the need to redefine America\u2019s foreign-policy heft in an interconnected world of more equal powers, and temperamentally inclined to prudence and diplomacy over force. Republican obstructionism and the politicization of foreign policy in a polarized Washington did not help him. American power, in his view, might still be dominant but could no longer be determinant.But when the most powerful nation on earth and chief underwriter of global security focuses on its limitations, others take note, perceiving new opportunity and new risk. Instability can become contagious. Unraveling can set in, as it has in the Middle East. The center cannot hold because there is none.\u201cI think Obama exaggerates the limits and underestimates the upside of American power, even if the trend is toward a more difficult environment for translating power and influence,\u201d Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. \u201cBy doing so, he runs the risk of actually reinforcing the very trends that give him pause. Too often during his presidency the gap between ends and means has been our undoing.\u201dIn Afghanistan, in Libya and most devastatingly in Syria, Obama has seemed beset by ambivalence: a surge undermined by a date certain for Afghan withdrawal; a lead-from-behind military campaign to oust Libya\u2019s dictator with zero follow-up plan; a statement more than four years ago that \u201cthe time has come\u201d for President Bashar al-Assad to \u201cstep aside\u201d without any strategy to make that happen, and a \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons that was not upheld. All this has said to Putin and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping that this is a time of wound-licking American incoherence.Yet Obama does not lack courage. Nor is he unprepared to take risks. It required courage to conclude the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 a signal achievement arrived at in the face of a vitriolic cacophony from Israel and the Republican-controlled Congress. It took courage to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba. The successful operation to kill Osama bin Laden was fraught with risk. His foreign policy has delivered in significant areas. America has wound down its wars. The home pivot has yielded a revived economy (at least for some) and given all Americans access to health insurance.Yet the cost of the Doctrine of Restraint has been very high. How high we do not yet know, but the world is more dangerous than in recent memory. Obama\u2019s skepticism about American power, his readiness to disengage from Europe and his catastrophic tiptoeing on Syria have left the Middle East in generational conflict and fracture, Europe unstable and Putin strutting the stage. Where this rudderless reality is likely to lead I will examine in my next column.Thomas L. Friedman is off today.Advertisement"}

Investors seemed pleased with the results, which helped raise Citigroup\u2019s share price more than 4 percent.Still, Citigroup joined other big banks in reporting declines in revenue in the third quarter. It said that revenue fell about 8 percent, to $18.5 billion, from a year ago.Citigroup\u2019s revenue was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but the drop was steeper than at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.Shrinking revenue across Wall Street reveals the challenges that big banks face when markets turn volatile and the world economy shows signs of slowing. At Citigroup, the slowdown in the trading of fixed income, commodities, currencies and credit was even more pronounced than executives had predicted.Total trading revenue fell 7 percent in the third quarter \u2014 driven by a 16 percent drop in the fixed-income trading unit.

Gerspach, said in a conference call with reporters that he did not expect the slowdown in Asia to cause \u201ca tidal wave\u201d of credit problems that would suddenly \u201cdescend on us.\u201dIn North America, Citigroup also reported a 4 percent decline in consumer revenue, driven largely by the lackluster performance of its branded credit cards. The bank has been working to pare down many of its credit card offerings and expand its customer base on fewer cards. That effort has required the bank to invest in acquiring new customers, which is weighing on results.The bank\u2019s overall cost of credit \u2014 the drag from delinquent commercial and consumer loans \u2014 increased 5 percent in the quarter. It had to set aside more money for credit losses in Latin America and Brazil in the quarter.With the fundamentals of the banking business showing signs of weakness, banks must rely on cost-cutting to bolster profits. In the third quarter, Citigroup said expenses fell 18 percent.Without adjusting for debt and credit valuations, Citigroup reported a profit of $4.3 billion, or $1.35 a share, on revenue of $18.7 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Student Loan System Stacked Against the Borrower", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair Game\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m being set up to fail.\u201dThat\u2019s how Patrick Wittwer, 31, described his experience trying to repay his roughly $50,000 in student loans. Between misdirected payments by one of the companies servicing his loan and the abusive collection tactics he encountered when he fell behind, Mr. Wittwer said the repayment process simply seemed stacked against him.A 2008 graduate of Temple University with a degree in media arts, Mr. Wittwer is not alone in his experience. Consumer advocates say student-loan servicers often make an already heavy debt load even more burdensome for borrowers.Some 41 million Americans owe $1.2 trillion in student loan debt. The median debt burden among borrowers was $20,000 in 2014, up from $13,000 in 2007.Companies servicing these loans manage borrowers\u2019 accounts, process their payments and enroll them in alternative repayment plans, including those based on a fixed share of the borrowers\u2019 income. Among the biggest companies are Navient, Great Lakes and Discover Bank.The Education Department has contracts with 11 loan servicers. But with no federal standards governing these activities, student-loan servicers have great leeway in their practices. Making matters worse, borrowers are not allowed to choose their servicers, so if they encounter problems, they cannot take their business elsewhere.Denise Horn, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the agency continues to strengthen the federal direct loan program \u201cto ensure all students and families receive the highest quality support from their federal loan servicers.\u201d She added: \u201cEveryone needs to do more to protect student loan borrowers \u2014 including servicers \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to take steps to strengthen the program and enhance oversight.\u201dOne common borrower complaint among the roughly 1,200 people who responded to the survey was that servicers simply fail to follow instructions. Borrowers hoping to reduce both the cost and the length of their repayment period, for example, often ask servicers to steer payments toward higher-cost loans first. In a number of cases, recipients said, the companies ignored these requests.\u201cFor servicers to ignore or do the opposite thing that a borrower would request is indicative of something very negative going on in the industry,\u201d said Jennifer Wang, policy director at Young Invincibles.Improper levying of late fees was another practice cited by those shouldering student loans. So were losing paperwork and making repeated requests for documentation.Perhaps the biggest problem cited by borrowers and their advocates was the failure of student loan servicers to advise their customers of the full array of repayment plans available to them. In many cases, this means borrowers do not know they are eligible for loan relief and do not receive it.Such relief includes repayment plans for federal loans based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size, or debt forgiveness programs for borrowers who work in public service. Military service members also have a right to a lower interest rate while they are on active duty.Rather than offer one of these programs, servicers often suggest loan forbearance, in which the borrower stops making payments temporarily. But because interest keeps piling up on the loan during the forbearance period, this is an expensive alternative. And some private student loan servicers charge a $150 fee to put an account into forbearance.Servicers say the complexity of federal student loan arrangements creates problems both for their workers who must try to explain these deals and for borrowers who need to understand them.But servicers receive $600 million a year for their work, and explaining loan terms is surely one of the jobs they are being paid to perform. \u201cFor a servicer to see a student loan borrower struggle and not help them get into the right repayment plan is a huge customer service failure,\u201d Ms. Wang said.It is also a taxpayer risk, given that such practices raise a borrower\u2019s potential to default.Mr. Wittwer, who lives in Philadelphia, said he had encountered difficulties with some of his loan payments even though he arranged for them to be deducted automatically from his bank account last year.\u201cAfter six or seven months, I get a late notice for my federal loans and I go in to my bank and double-check that the loan was being paid,\u201d he said. \u201cMy loans had been transferred to another office, but the original office had kept collecting it.\u201dIt took about a month to fix the problem, Mr. Wittwer said. \u201cYou have to be hypervigilant about it because student loans are constantly being sold and moved.\u201dMs. Dundon of the Center for Responsible Lending said that the Education Department had fixed some of the problems in its servicing contracts but that financial incentives were still misaligned in certain areas. For example, service companies receive more money if the loans they oversee are being paid off, and less if borrowers stop paying. While this system encourages servicers to keep borrowers current \u2014 a good thing \u2014 it discourages them from working with borrowers who fall behind.Mr. Wittwer said he is currently paying $756 a month on his student loans, the minimum amount. He acknowledged that he did not understand the consequences of the sky-high interest rates on his loans when he took them on. But his credit score is rising and he has a job.Discover Bank paid $18.5 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing.Repaying a student loan is challenging enough without servicers adding to the burden with incompetence or dubious practices. Borrowers and taxpayers deserve better.An earlier version of this column misstated part of the name of the government agency that issued a report last month about student loan servicing. It is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, not Board.Advertisement"}

Ms. Gerwig plays Maggie, a college administrator planning to have a baby without a partner. But she develops a kinship with a professor and her plan doesn\u2019t work out as she expected. Ms. Miller, whose films \u201cAngela\u201d and \u201cPersonal Velocity\u201d have explored more dramatic territory, answered questions about her new, lighter work and discussed her experiences at the festival. Here are excerpts from that conversation.Q. What has been your been your best memory or experience of the New York Film Festival?What in the main slate are you looking forward to seeing in the festival?\u201cCarol.\u201d It looks beautiful and I think Todd Haynes is a wonderful director. I\u2019m also looking forward to \u201cBridge of Spies.\u201dHow do you feel about being one of only a few women with films in the main slate?I can\u2019t shake the fact that I think of myself as a human being. As women make more and more films that people want to see, they will lead with their success. I can\u2019t help but believe that, because to believe that wouldn\u2019t be true is so depressing. I\u2019ve had a very specific kind of career. All my films, I\u2019ve had complete artistic control and I haven\u2019t pandered to an audience. I\u2019ve always done what I wanted. It\u2019s hard for me to measure, because I have male friends who are having the same problems getting films made. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good measuring stick, but I\u2019m grateful to be here.How did you come to make \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan?\u201dIt\u2019s based on an unpublished novel by Karen Rinaldi, a friend of mine, who sent me the book. I was looking for something light to adapt, something funny, set in New York because I live here, my children are here, my family\u2019s here. She had the initial hook, the central dilemma. And even though I changed the world it was in and I introduced other characters, I needed to hang all my ideas on something and that\u2019s what I hung it on.Was there a challenging moment in the shoot?There were a lot of weather moments going on. We had to shoot two days\u2019 worth of work up a mountain in upstate New York, which was standing in for Quebec. We had to deal with paparazzi on the mountain for Julianne Moore because she had just won the Oscar. And the actors and crew had to deal with working on ice. We were all terrified that someone was going to break an arm. The crew had never worked together, but I think it was a real bonding experience. The crew was impeccably cooperative and kind to each other, and I think one of the reasons was because of that shoot. But we ended up being finished early.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Human Emotion: The One Thing the Internet Can\u2019t Buy", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySign of the TimesThe empathy economy is booming \u2014 and facts are out, feelings are in.We designers love to fashion ourselves as \u2018\u2018problem solvers,\u2019\u2019 but let\u2019s face it: The line between solving problems and creating them is blurry at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of heels, or a $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural extravaganza in the Bois de Boulogne? The truth is, no matter what designers say, we have never simply answered problems. The act of design vacillates between the functional and the beguiling, often performing one while claiming the other. Le Corbusier dismissed the architecture of his Beaux-Arts contemporaries as cloying, while he looked longingly to the brutal utility of the grain elevators and factories devised by American engineers. Almost a century later, Rem Koolhaas jettisoned function in favor of performance: \u2018\u2018Functionality is boring; and performance is really, what role does the building play and what kind of scene does the building trigger?\u2019\u2019 There has long been an ideological divide between the utilitarian and the emotional, between rational design and the decorative arts, but the balance of power is shifting: In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut\u2019s now cleaning up.The empathy economy is booming. Facts are out, feelings are in. This is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand mania that asserts that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the I.R.S. needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities, politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it means, but how it makes us feel. A brand is a promise. It\u2019s the putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a particular product, place or individual. So the new handbag makes us feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka, suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at least the ones everyone emulates, successfully use design to produce an emotional coherence that spans content to product to experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look alike, but it all has to feel alike. Whenever we encounter them we get that familiar brand sensation. That tingling tells you it\u2019s working.So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian, slightly embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board has long been associated with the softer design arts \u2014 fashion, interiors, styling \u2014 that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators used them, but serious architects didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no science to it, simply a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of Xeroxed pictures pinned to a foam-core panel or scattered on the studio floor, a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere. Its very vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don\u2019t signify any one thing, but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a silky kitty, when juxtaposed with an Angora bunny, a desiccated dandelion and an Eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the corporeal and becomes the essence of fluffiness. For the professional brand manager the mood board attempts to render, in a handful of swiped images, some vague quintessence that\u2019s difficult to achieve with words.For fashion designers, who are required to pump out a new set of allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential (yet highly confidential) way to pinpoint explicit references before assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer recalls how when she worked at the brand in the \u201900s, the mood boards were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch them. The foam core was covered in different materials \u2014 linen for one collection, cotton for another \u2014 and the teams were required to use specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time, never stacked, lest the surface be disturbed. As almost proof of how far we\u2019ve come, last spring for his men\u2019s collection, Raf Simons came right out and superimposed his reference images \u2014 a Japanese woodblock print, a photo of a roller coaster, an astronaut, a shark \u2014 directly onto the backs of coats and jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to \u2018\u2018mood boards you\u2019d pin your favorite images to.\u2019\u2019As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our clothes or living room to feel to how we want our minivan or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood business continues to expand. (A friend recently told me her therapist encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the feelings related to her recent divorce.) This expansion is fueled, in large part, by the sheer overabundance of available images. It\u2019s hard to remember that a couple of decades ago, finding pictures of things involved countless, tedious hours of random page flipping. Now a few seconds of furious key-stroking produces endless examples to regurgitate. Every possible idea is immediately diluted by retroactive references. That glut of images is constantly resifted through personal curation tools such as Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration websites such as ffffound.com and vfiles.com. Such hyper-individualistic online collections, in turn, become open-source mood repositories scavenged by branding professionals. Why assemble collections of your own when there are millions that exist, all ready for appropriation? Need to evoke cozy softness with a vaguely synthetic overtone, an early \u201970s color palette and just a touch of glam rock? Missile-silo chic? Midcentury Crimean beach culture? I can almost guarantee someone out there has that covered. There are even Pinterest pages dedicated to collecting other mood boards: collections of collections. And then, of course, there is Instagram, which turns every individual life into a social network mood board. The carefully curated Instagram account is essentially a personal image-management tool: private life as public brand.While the ascendancy of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to the lurking presence of Big Data. As vast files of metadata and personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in god-knows-where, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences that at least promise something warmer and more human. When everything is available all the time and we\u2019re inundated with information in every way, shape and form, we\u2019re left no choice but to favor what makes us feel.Advertisement"}

Look for it on Comedy Central.In \u201cNathan for You,\u201d Mr. Fielder spends most of his time trying to help small-business owners improve their bottom lines, using techniques that presumably are not being taught at Princeton or anywhere else. There was, for instance, an episode last season in which he deduced that a liquor store owner\u2019s problem was that he wasn\u2019t selling to minors.\u201cNo business should ever have to turn away a paying customer,\u201d he explained.And so he came up with a system that, he thought, could give a minor the thrill and social cachet of buying alcoholic beverages but avoid the problems associated with drinking them. He told the store owner to sell booze to children, then put the bottles in storage while giving the young customers claim checks \u2014 they could come back and retrieve their purchases when they turned 21.The same episode, by the way, also featured a carwash that was short on customers. Mr. Fielder\u2019s solution: Increase the nearby bird population. Because \u2014 well, bird droppings, cars; you get the idea. When he concluded that pigeons weren\u2019t delivering in sufficient quantity, he brought in an assortment of chickens \u2014 yes, they can perch in trees \u2014 and eventually a peacock.He sometimes indulges other whims in the show, as in a Season 1 episode in which he challenged himself to escape from handcuffs before a robot could remove his pants in front of an audience of children.As for that Nobel in economics, Mr. Fielder is way ahead of the curve in acknowledging that ludicrousness is the defining feature of our age. Companies that have no revenue and produce no tangible product are hot Wall Street commodities. Traders make millions in split seconds via arcane number-crunching. In that climate, putting advertisements for a pet store on tombstones in a pet cemetery \u2014 Season 2, Episode 3 \u2014 seems downright sane.That none of Mr. Fielder\u2019s business solutions ever work should not disqualify him from laureate consideration, because his deadpan genius is in defining the age, not solving its problems. As for the Season 3 premiere, he takes on a problem that has been vexing small-business owners ever since Walmart and Costco and other behemoths appeared on the landscape: How does a lone shop owner compete with the cost efficiencies of a big-box store?Specifically, he tries to help a small electronics store that has been losing business to a Best Buy. His plan involves exploiting Best Buy\u2019s price guarantee \u2014 it claims it will match any competitor\u2019s prices \u2014 a solution that ultimately involves an alligator, a door so tiny customers have to crawl through it, a fake dating show and a salsa lesson.

{"Headline": "Glencore Isn\u2019t Out of the Woods Yet", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Shares of Glencore, the giant Swiss-based mining and trading company, may have recovered from a panic sell-off this week, but few analysts consider the company out of danger.Glencore still has a heavy debt load, and investors remained worried about global economic trends and some management missteps. And the slowing Chinese economy is hurting demand for many of the commodities, like copper, that the company not only mines but also heavily trades.\u201cThere is clearly a very strong degree of fear in the market more broadly associated with China,\u201d said Paul Gait, a mining analyst at Bernstein Research in London.Until recently, though, the company\u2019s management, led by Ivan Glasenberg, seemed reluctant to acknowledge the severity of the situation.The company announced on Aug. 19 that it had lost $676 million for the first half of the year, compared with a profit of $1.7 billion for the period a year earlier. But Mr. Glasenberg tried to soothe concerns, writing in a letter to shareholders that commodity prices \u201cappear driven increasingly by perceptions and technical factors rather than reality or fundamentals.\u201dIn response, investors and analysts began asking whether the company would be able to continue servicing its heavy debt, which the company said was $30 billion at the end of the first half of 2015. The company does not include $17 billion in trading inventories in that figure, an omission that may be further spooking investors.Fears that Glencore cannot meet its debt obligations evidently helped lead to the steep drop on Monday, when the shares fell 29 percent in a single trading day. The company reacted on Tuesday with a statement saying that its business was \u201coperationally and financially robust\u201d and had \u201cabsolutely no solvency issues.\u201dBy Thursday, after first being sharply higher, shares closed down 0.58 percent for the day. That left them down about 6.2 percent for the week.While Mr. Gait and some other analysts doubt that Glencore is on the verge of being unable to pay its debt, analysts say the company will probably be under pressure until it convinces investors that it has taken steps to address their concerns.\u201cDownside risk will likely continue to dominate\u201d the company\u2019s shares \u201cuntil it can reinforce its capital base,\u201d wrote Dominic O\u2019Kane, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Cazenove in London.Glencore\u2019s origins are the trading operations of Marc Rich, the trader who fled to Switzerland to avoid tax evasion charges in the United States. He was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. Mr. Glasenberg and a group of associates bought out the business in the early 1990s and took it public in 2011.Mr. Glasenberg, who owns more than 8 percent of the stock, has built the company into a global behemoth with 181,000 employees and contractors.Based in Baar, Switzerland, Glencore has an unusual combination of businesses. The company is a major metal producer with mines in Zambia, Australia, Chile and elsewhere, and oil production in Equatorial Guinea and Chad. It is also a leading trading firm, moving oil and other commodities around the world and parking them in a vast network of storage tanks and warehouses.Glencore argues that this combination of businesses gives it a unique insight into markets. While the company appears to have been caught off guard by this year\u2019s drop in commodity prices, the trading arm, in theory, should be a more stable business during that downturn by being able to hedge against price fluctuations.\u201cThe absolute price level is not that relevant for a trading business,\u201d said Roland Rechtsteiner, a Zurich-based partner at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. Mr. Rechtsteiner said the volatility of prices and the ability to arbitrage between different geographic areas were more important for trading profits.That held true in the year\u2019s first half, when Glencore\u2019s overall earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation from trading fell by about 27 percent, to $1.2 billion. But the company\u2019s energy trading profits more than doubled to $479 million, as Glencore was able to navigate the turbulent oil market.A key building block for Glencore was the $30 billion takeover of the miner Xstrata in 2013, which was one of the world\u2019s biggest coal extractors and exporters, but also big in copper and other metals.That deal so far has looked poorly timed. Mr. Glasenberg paid in shares, but Xstrata brought a pile of debt along with its mines. And since then coal prices have declined, not only because of the general commodities downdraft but because coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels, is falling from favor.And the price of copper, which is the biggest contributor to Glencore\u2019s operating income, at about 30 percent, has also been falling, down about 18 percent this year.Analysts at Goldman Sachs have forecast that copper, now about $5,000 per metric ton, might fall to $4,500 by the end of next year.That is one reason Glencore has at least temporarily closed some of its copper mines in Africa, shutting down the Katanga mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Mopani mine in Zambia.The company is now moving fast to cut its debt load. In September, it placed $2.5 billion in shares; Mr. Glasenberg and other employees took 22 percent of the offer. The company has also suspended its dividend, saying it plans to sell $2 billion in assets.Some analysts say that those moves, though not small, are not enough. As a miner and trader of commodities whose prices still may not have found their bottom, Glencore is too dependent on forces not completely in its control.How Glencore fares, Mr. O\u2019Kane of J.P. Morgan wrote, may \u201chinge on small changes in commodity prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Euro-Optimism", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Europe is declining, disintegrating, collapsing \u2014 for many observers, the only question left is how long this ugly drama will last. Across the Continent, optimism about the future of the European project is in short supply.Perhaps the lone holdout is Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel continues to tell her critics that, from the Greek financial meltdown to the refugee crisis, a common solution is at hand. \u201cWe can achieve that,\u201d she has said.As is often the case these days, Ms. Merkel knows what she\u2019s talking about. Not only can Europe overcome its current challenges, but the storm is actually making the union stronger.The three crises threatening the European Union\u2019s rules-based system are indeed serious: Greece, the Ukraine conflict and the refugee crisis.But the response, largely coordinated by Germany, has been equally impressive. Ms. Merkel has set up an informal system of governance that works fairly well, inside and outside Germany: her coalition partners, the Social Democrats, at home; President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, crucial to winning Western Europe; the European Council president, Donald Tusk, representing Central European interests; and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who knows how to play the Brussels machine. President Obama is the key outside partner.A Merkel-centric \u201cpower-horizontal\u201d sets up a very different union from the one that governments have agreed to in the treaties. Instead of Brussels, Berlin has become the power center. Neither federalists nor nationalists are happy with that.And yet it is astonishingly efficient. Despite repeated predictions to the contrary, Europe is not falling apart. It is tackling the big crises together, with the regular meetings of heads of state becoming the central platform for decision making. With the possible exception of Britain, no country wants to leave, and union membership remains the dream of countries along its periphery.Consider the euro crisis. As early as 2010, pessimists were swearing that it exposed a fundamental flaw in the currency union\u2019s architecture, pitting strong economies against weak ones. And yet, five years later, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are recovering, while Greece is out of critical condition, with a left-wing government committed to the painful reforms necessary to stay in the euro. Battered, the currency is all the stronger for it.The same can be said for the Ukraine conflict. What was once a situation poised on the knife-edge of open war has, thanks to Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande, moved from the military playing field to the diplomatic arena. The United States, which was at first skeptical of their Minsk agreement, has quickly put its full weight behind the deal. Russia has been checked, giving Ukraine the opportunity to build a stronger state that can resist Russian attempts to bring it back in its sphere of control. Again, the union was tested, and it became stronger.Perhaps no challenge better illustrates the union\u2019s strengths than the waves of refugees arriving in Europe. Ms. Merkel has correctly framed it as a challenge for Europe as a whole, rather than for individual countries. And Europe has acted accordingly, taking a contentious but successful vote to spread the burden of accepting the refugees.True, the old refugee system broke down under the sudden weight. But with a speed that surprised even Euro-optimists, the union has begun to fashion new rules, often on the fly.What we see unfolding is a pan-European system of governance. It\u2019s not always pretty. But that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when 28 countries with different histories have to compromise on vital issues, and quickly.The new European Union is redefining the role of the nation state without replacing it. The new European Union is overwhelmingly intergovernmental, built around cooperation among nation states. It is based on deal making, with the German chancellor as the power broker at the center. It deals with issues that have long been seen as internal affairs, at the heart of sovereignty such as currency, security and borders.And while in the past the European Union was built and administered by bureaucrats, largely hidden from the public, the new union is deeply political.

{"Headline": "Kunduz and the Many Failures in Afghanistan", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorInstead of inclusiveness and unity, we have an isolated government at odds with its own constituency. Countering corruption and making government more responsive now appear to be extravagant hopes. The leadership has failed to agree on very basic key appointments, such as an attorney general and governors. Increased attacks and disputed territories stymie the prospects for better security. Ungoverned spaces and the emergence of terrorist groups like the Islamic State pose a graver threat today than they did a year ago.The plight of Afghanistan and its uncertain future can be seen globally by the mass exodus of its youth. According to United Nations figures, we are ranked No. 2, after Syria, in the number of refugees fleeing the country. On the streets here in Kabul, families are selling all their household goods in order to escape \u2014 a scene reminiscent of our recent dark past. I am deeply disturbed by images of young Afghans on dangerous voyages in search of refuge and better economic prospects.The national unity government was grudgingly welcomed by Afghans as a stopgap measure, but it has lost time and opportunity to consolidate itself in its first year.With bruised constitutional legitimacy, Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah needed to focus promptly on the issues that matter most to the Afghan population: the economy, security and governance. Instead, the leaders had a na\u00efve or perhaps delusional belief that they had a strong mandate from the Afghan population. They decided to take on one of the most sensitive issues facing the country: resetting ties with Pakistan. The failure to achieve improved relations cost President Ghani an immense amount of political capital. His eroding credibility has even raised populist questions about his political loyalties.The two teams constituting the national unity government have engaged in a bitter power-sharing fight that has led to a loss of public confidence. Leaders bargain for influence with divisive undertones around ethnicity; in some cases it becomes a question of the westernized elite versus traditional loyalties. The tug of war over distribution of key government positions has led to institutional paralysis.And the leadership has proved unable to communicate to its domestic audience. Rather than provide a vision for the country, they have tried to exonerate themselves by saying they inherited a bad legacy.In their telling, failure to implement campaign promises isn\u2019t their fault; it\u2019s the fault of reduced international military presence and aid. But upon what foresight were these promises based? Just when the political and military transition of 2014 was supposed to build a sense that the country could turn inward for solutions, this scapegoating is costly to morale and the prospects that Afghanistan can ever stand firmly on its own feet.The challenges to the national unity government formula will not vanish miraculously. However, the government can correct the course, by acknowledging the gravity of the situation and prioritizing the following steps.First, the government needs to shift focus to domestic politics. Internal cohesion can improve national morale, underpin the government\u2019s legitimacy and build resilience. The national unity government leaders must show a strong commitment to implementing the key milestones under the political agreement of Sept. 20, 2014, including convening a loya jirga, or grand council, a year from now. Pragmatism must guide the government\u2019s approach here \u2014 both in preparing for the council, and in garnering widespread support for a common political agenda. Leaders must not invoke convenient excuses to avoid or delay their commitments under the political agreement. There is a real risk that the national unity government could succumb to security challenges by the Taliban, foreign militant groups or a political insurgence.Second, the government must become inclusive in its approach to governance. And it needs to act with confidence and tact. The protracted wrangling on issues such as postponing parliamentary elections, the distribution of electronic identity cards, the signing of a cooperation agreement with Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency and the appointment of an electoral reform commission greatly undermined the credibility of a voiceless government. Our leaders must quickly figure out how to instill a sense of hope and confidence in the country. Our security forces must know and believe in what they are defending and dying for.Third, our leaders, and other influential voices in the country, must protect the integrity of the Afghan democratic and constitutional polity. From the chaos of 2001, we have built the foundations of a democratic system over the past 14 years. We have to nurture, not stifle, political opposition, within the framework of our constitutional system.Continued and enhanced economic and political support to Afghanistan is crucial for the viability of the government. Afghanistan is faring better than Syria and Iraq in many ways, but it appears to have exhausted its stay on top of the American and international community agendas. If Afghanistan is to have the chance to become a success story because of the United States and NATO intervention, it cannot be abandoned halfway.Ershad Ahmadi was deputy foreign minister for political affairs in Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014 and is the president of Kabul Compass, a strategic analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bread Is Broken", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "The Food IssueIndustrial production destroyed both the taste and the nutritional value of wheat. One scientist believes he can undo the damage.Supported by\u2018\u2018You put all three of those together, and you get a very good idea of what type of product that\u2019s going to bake,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u2018\u2018Then you come over here\u2019\u2019 \u2014 we moved to the left side of the room \u2014 \u2018\u2018and you have everything that a craft baker would be familiar with.\u2019\u2019 There was a wooden baker\u2019s bench, wicker nests for rising dough, a steam-injected hearth oven full of crispening boules, an assortment of hand-operated mills. And there was flour: flour piled in bowls, flour coating every available surface, flour kicked up into the air as we walked by.What most people picture when they think of flour \u2014 that anonymous chalk-white powder from the supermarket \u2014 is anathema to Jones. Before the advent of industrial agriculture, Americans enjoyed a wide range of regional flours milled from equally diverse wheats, which in turn could be used to make breads that were astonish\u00adingly flavorful and nutritious. For nearly a century, however, America has grown wheat tailored to an industrial system designed to produce nutrient-poor flour and insipid, spongy breads soaked in preservatives. For the sake of profit and expediency, we forfeited pleasure and health. The Bread Lab\u2019s mission is to make regional grain farming viable once more, by creating entirely new kinds of wheat that unite the taste and wholesomeness of their ancestors with the robustness of their modern counterparts.Although regional grain economies have developed in California, North Carolina, Arizona and elsewhere, there are few people who match Jones\u2019s fervor for wheat and none with an equally grand vision for its future. His lab was founded just three years ago, but it has already earned the respect of the country\u2019s most celebrated bakers, like Chad Robertson of Tartine and Jeffrey Hamelman, the director of King Arthur Bakery. Dan Barber teamed up with Jones to develop \u2018\u2018Barber wheat\u2019\u2019 for his restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, which is ensconced in a working farm. Bread Lab breads have even made their way to the kitchens of the White House.In recent months, the lab\u2019s newfound popularity has caused a bit of an identity crisis. Its latest collaborator is the fast-casual Mexican chain Chipotle, which wants to use one of the lab\u2019s regional wheats in its tortillas. Chipotle serves 800,000 tortillas around the country every day. \u2018\u2018There are definitely issues of scale,\u2019\u2019 Jones says. \u2018\u2018If you have Chipotle come in, how big does it get, and how quickly? Do we end up with a commodity by any other name?\u2019\u2019A few years after college, Jones apprenticed with an Idaho wheat breeder named D.W. Sunderman, who taught him the craft of breeding: selectively cross-pollinating plants in order to create entirely new varieties. A head of wheat contains up to a hundred hermaphroditic flowers that usually pollinate themselves. Jones would choose a head on one wheat plant and pluck out all its pollen-producing anthers with tweezers, preventing self-pollination. Then, using plastic tubing or gauze, he would bind the neutered head to an intact one on a second wheat plant. Because wheat produces so many flowers, and has a gargantuan genome many times larger than our own, a single cross can yield a carnival of wildly different offspring. \u2018\u2018He taught me how beautiful plant breeding could be,\u2019\u2019 Jones says of Sunderman, \u2018\u2018and also the notion that if I wanted his job, I would have to get a Ph.D.\u2019\u2019In 1991, Jones completed his doctorate in genetics at the University of California, Davis, and the U.S.D.A. hired him to study the wheat genome at Washington State University\u2019s main campus in Pullman. Three years later, Jones landed a job as one of W.S.U.\u2019s chief wheat breeders. At first, he was ecstatic, but disillusionment soon followed. The essence of plant breeding is innovation \u2014 the prospect of creating something truly novel. Yet in his first official role as a wheat breeder, Jones felt stifled. He was tasked with improving the yield and disease-resistance of wheat cultivars that had been designed for industrial milling. Prioritizing qualities the food industry considered superfluous was discouraged. When he tried breeding wheat with higher levels of nourishing minerals, like iron, zinc and magnesium, he was told those characteristics were unimportant. When he proposed working with a healthier wheat that still made excellent bread flour \u2014 albeit of a somewhat yellow tint \u2014 the university expressed no interest, he says.Commodity wheats are defined in just three ways: hard (high in protein, which is good for bread) or soft (better for pastries); red (dark color and strong flavor) or white (pale and more delicate-tasting); and winter or spring, depending on when they are planted. \u2018\u2018Hard red spring,\u2019\u2019 for example, is often used for bread; \u2018\u2018soft white winter\u2019\u2019 is better for pastries. A vast majority of America\u2019s 56 million acres of wheat grow in a belt stretching more than 1,000 miles from the Canadian border to Central Texas. Around half of the crop is exported, and most of what remains is funneled to feedlots for cattle or to giant mills and bread factories, which churn out all those bags of generic white flour and limp sandwich bread sleeved twice in plastic. This industrial system forces plant breeders to prioritize wheat kernels of highly specific sizes, colors and hardness.By 2007, Jones had spent more than a decade begrudgingly breeding wheats for the commodities market. His opinion of industrial agriculture was no secret, however. As tensions mounted between Jones and the university, he made a bold decision: In order to escape the commodities system, he would give up wheat altogether. In 2008, he moved to W.S.U.\u2019s western campus to become director of the W.S.U.-Mount Vernon Research Center, which helps small- and mid-scale farmers in the surrounding Skagit Valley, halfway between Seattle and Vancouver, grow about 80 different kinds of fruits, vegetables and flowers.While preparing for the move, Jones thought he would end up working on cabbage for sauerkraut or cucumbers for pickling; he didn\u2019t have a spiritual connection with those crops, but he liked them well enough. Driving around the area, how\u00adever, he was startled to discover one wheat field after another. Farmers told him it was crucial for crop rotations, which disrupt disease cycles and return nutrients to the soil. They harvested and sold the grain, but only to lose less money. There was no sense in trying to compete with giant growers in the nation\u2019s wheat belt. What would happen, Jones wondered, if he developed unique varieties of wheat adapted to the Skagit\u2019s cool, wet climate and extremely fertile soil? What if he could interest local millers and bakers in dealing primarily with Washington wheat? What if wheat, like wine, had terroir? After all, it used to.As wheat spread from the coasts inward, so did flour mills. By 1840, 23,000 of them were scattered throughout the country. (Today there are around 200.) People would bring wheat they farmed themselves, or bought from nearby farmers, to the closest mill. As the culinary historian Karen Hess noted: \u2018\u2018Even if you yourself did not grow wheat, you knew that what you bought was local wheat, and you knew its baking characteristics.\u2019\u2019 Bakers and homemakers were used to adjusting their recipes to accommodate different varieties. And they knew how to spot high-quality flour: \u2018\u2018Good flour adheres slightly to the hand, and if pressed in the hand retains its shape,\u2019\u2019 advised \u2018\u2018The Young Housekeeper\u2019s Friend,\u2019\u2019 published in 1845.In the mid-1800s, America\u2019s patchwork of regional grain economies began to give way to a much more integrated system. The Erie Canal and transcontinental railroads opened up the vast expanse of the Great Plains to wheat farmers, while also offering affordable ways to ship grain across the country. By the late 1800s, wheat farming had largely shifted to Midwestern states.At the same time, the Industrial Revolution fundamentally altered the process of turning grain into flour. Jones has a pantomime he likes to perform when discussing the millenniums-long history of milling: \u2018\u2018First, there was pounding with mortar and pestle,\u2019\u2019 he says, smashing a fist into an open palm. \u2018\u2018Then, there was this\u2019\u2019 \u2014 he moves his hands back and forth parallel to the ground, mimicking the manual grinding of grain between two slabs of stone. \u2018\u2018Then, it turned into this,\u2019\u2019 he continues, rotating his hands around an invisible vertical axis to conjure the motion of the stone mill, which could be powered by water, wind or animal. \u2018\u2018And then this.\u2019\u2019 He points his index fingers toward each other and spins them in sync.That last transition, the steel roller mill \u2014 which first appeared in Budapest in 1839 \u2014 was a radical departure from previous techniques, because it sheared the wheat kernel apart. A grain of wheat has three main components: a fibrous and nutrient-rich outer coating called the bran; the flavorful and aromatic germ, a living embryo that eventually develops into the adult plant; and a pouch of starch known as the endosperm, which makes up the bulk of the grain. Before roller mills, all three parts were mashed together when processed. As a result, flour was not the inert white powder most of us are familiar with today; it was pungent, golden and speckled, because of fragrant oils released from the living germ and bits of hardy bran. If freshly ground flour was not used within a few weeks, however, the oils turned it rancid.Roller mills solved this problem. Their immense spinning cylinders denuded the endosperm and discarded the germ and bran, producing virtually unspoilable alabaster flour composed entirely of endosperm. It was a boon for the growing flour industry: Mills could now source wheat from all over, blend it to achieve consistency and transport it across the nation without worrying about shelf life. That newfound durability came at a huge cost, however, sacrificing much of the grain\u2019s flavor and nutrition. In the 1940s, to compensate for these nutritional deficiencies, flour producers started fortifying white flour with iron and B vitamins, a ubiquitous practice today. The rise of roller milling and bread factories also put pressure on plant breeders to make wheat even more amenable to the new dominant technologies; whiteness, hardness and uniformity took precedence over flavor, nutrition and novelty.Today, whole-wheat flour accounts for only 6 percent of all flour produced in the United States. And most whole-wheat products sold in supermarkets are made from roller-milled flour with the germ and bran added back in. According to the F.D.A.\u2019s standards, flour labeled \u2018\u2018whole wheat\u2019\u2019 must retain the germ, bran and endosperm in their native proportions, and \u2018\u2018whole-wheat bread\u2019\u2019 must be made with whole-wheat flour, but the agency does not verify products\u2019 composition before they hit the market.It\u2019s also unclear how industrial mills add back the oily germ without significantly shortening shelf life, a topic they are hesitant to discuss. David Killilea, a nutrition scientist at the Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland Research Institute in California, says big mills might deactivate the living germ by steaming it or exposing it to gamma rays. In Michael Pollan\u2019s most recent book, \u2018\u2018Cooked,\u2019\u2019 one former General Mills employee confesses that the germ was thrown out because it was too much trouble. Killilea and his colleagues are currently developing a test to determine the proportions of endosperm, germ and bran in an anonymous sample of flour, which could bring transparency to the murky practices of industrial mills.De Pasquale took handfuls of flour and crushed them in his fist to assess their moisture. He quickly mixed the flours with water and yeast and scooped up a portion to taste. Finally, he baked a baguette, a batard and a miche with each flour. \u2018\u2018A couple did not have much flavor or structure,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018but one of them in particular, Bauermeister, knocked my socks off.\u2019\u2019 The bread came out of the oven dark brown. He sliced into it, squeezed the loaf near his face and breathed in: There was a noticeable aroma of chocolate, an alcoholic twang and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. He took a bite. \u2018\u2018The flavors were so deep, so complex,\u2019\u2019 De Pasquale says. \u2018\u2018The cell structure was really beautiful too. Giant holes, chewable and soft. I\u2019d never been whacked on the head like that before.\u2019\u2019Inspired by De Pasquale\u2019s reaction, Jones ramped up his efforts to breed for \u2018\u2018flavor, nutrition, funkiness.\u2019\u2019 Each year, Jones and his senior scientific assistant, Steve Lyon, along with three graduate students \u2014 Bethany Econopouly, Brigid Meints and Colin Curwen-McAdams \u2014 grow between 5,000 and 10,000 kinds of wheat. So far the Mount Vernon breeders have produced wheat with higher than typical levels of iron and other micronutrients; grains that are strikingly blue, purple and black; and wheats that imbue bread with maltiness, spice, caramel \u2014 a whole palette of flavors most people would never expect. \u2018\u2018Much as grapes acquire a sense of place, we are finding so does wheat,\u2019\u2019 Jones says. This fall, he plans to publicly release two lines: a West Coast-adapted version of a French wheat named Renan, and a hard red winter wheat called Skagit 09, each of which makes excellent, nutty, moderately dark bread. Once released, the cultivars will either be freely distributed or sold affordably to farmers.At first, it was just Jones baking bread from his wheat. Two years ago, having reached his \u2018\u2018limit of credibility,\u2019\u2019 he decided to hire a resident baker. He settled on Jonathan Bethony, a slender man who sports a thick chestnut beard and has studied with some of the best in his field. With Bethony onboard, the Bread Lab\u2019s reputation grew even faster, drawing in an ever-widening circle of bread masters and renowned chefs. The lab also became the host of the Grain Gathering, an annual conference that attracts 250 grain obsessives from all over the country. Jones and his colleagues have now outgrown their cozy headquarters; by spring of next year, they will move to a 12,000-square-foot building that they are renting from the Port of Skagit. Their new home will feature a much larger lab and an educational center where King Arthur Flour will train 2,000 bakers each year.Encouraged by the Bread Lab\u2019s success, a group of investors is planning to build a mill nearby, which will have the capacity to produce millions of pounds of flour annually. In part, this is an attempt to solve a huge challenge for large bakeries interested in freshly milled whole-wheat flour: inconsistency. Although the new mill may produce some single-variety stone-ground flours, it will focus on roller-milling wheat and blending different types to achieve uniformity. These first signs of concession to industrial techniques have alarmed some in Jones\u2019s circle. Perhaps, they worry, the Bread Lab and its affiliated projects are getting too big and too popular for their own good. Is it really possible to scale up without becoming the very type of system Jones and the others fled?After a few false starts, Bethony devised a viable recipe using just five ingredients: water, oil, salt, whole-wheat Edison flour and a sourdough starter. The starter, a living concoction of flour, water and microbes, is not exactly standard procedure for a tortilla, but it is crucial for Bethony\u2019s version: It magnifies flavor, makes the wheat molecules more digestible and extends the tortilla\u2019s shelf life by adding acidity. Bethony taught his techniques to Ruben Berber and Tom Hoffert, who work in research and development at Don Pancho Authentic Mexican Foods in Salem, Ore., Chipotle\u2019s primary tortilla supplier in the Northwest.To accommodate Ells\u2019s vision, Don Pancho has seriously modified its production process. The company must continually prepare and store large volumes of sourdough starter, maintaining just the right temperature and pH level. Further complicating matters, whole-wheat flour is often temperamental. It absorbs much more water than most bakers expect, and the shards of bran threaten to tangle the smooth strands of gluten, creating a sandy texture. If something goes wrong, the tortillas might turn out too bitter, or not stretch to their full size, which would be disastrous for a burrito that typically envelops more than half a day\u2019s recommended calories. So Don Pancho has been cutting Edison with white flour. The tortillas they have produced so far are dense, golden-tinged and slightly tangy.Ells plans to test the semi-whole-wheat tor\u00adtillas in the Pacific Northwest. If things go well, he says, he will pair regional sources of wheat with tortilla makers around the country, which means the tortillas in, say, California might taste different from those in Florida \u2014 a discrepancy that would make many chains cringe. Although Jones and his community celebrate Chipotle\u2019s openness to such diversity, they have also been unnerved by its interest. When Jones started working with wheat farmers in the Skagit Valley, he hoped to \u2018\u2018keep value where it was produced,\u2019\u2019 not to partner with a company that has more than 1,900 venues and serves 1.4 million customers each day. What if satisfying Chipotle deprives others?Edison wheat grows primarily in one location: 500 acres of Oregon farmland managed by Jones\u2019s collaborators Tom and Sue Hunton and their family. A few months ago, nearly all of that wheat had been reserved for Chipotle, which irked some of the Huntons\u2019 customers, like Mel Darbyshire of Grand Central Bakery in Seattle and Nan Kohler, who owns Grist & Toll, the only stone mill in greater Los Angeles. \u2018\u2018Businesses like mine and local bakers need to be baking with that Edison,\u2019\u2019 Kohler said at the time. \u2018\u2018If Chipotle walks away, then what? We haven\u2019t created something sustainable.\u2019\u2019Since then, thanks to a bountiful harvest and a decreased quota from Chipotle, the Huntons have been able to sell Edison to Darbyshire and Kohler. Tom Hunton is still waiting on an official contract from Chipotle. Yet he is optimistic that the partnership will work out. He also sees this as an opportunity to extend the benefits of re\u00adgional grain economies beyond their geographic borders. \u2018\u2018In this case, even over distance, the connection between grower, baker and miller is much more cemented and transparent than other instances in a closer radius,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a void out there that needs to be filled with something other than the industrial-mill model. This is one way to do it.\u2019\u2019Despite the Bread Lab\u2019s growing influence, it is still quite sealed off from most of American society. For those of us who are not ardent home bakers buying fresh whole-grain flour from one of the few recently resurrected stone mills, who do not regularly queue up at Tartine or dine at the likes of Blue Hill, the kinds of wheat and bread the lab extols are still largely inaccessible. That is the power of industrial agriculture: It has so thoroughly expunged genuine whole-wheat flour from our diet that most of us do not even notice its absence. And here is where the partnership with Chipotle just might make sense: If it succeeds, it will bring real whole wheat to more American plates than any other Bread Lab collaboration so far.Of course, that all depends on how faithful Chipotle remains to Jones\u2019s grand vision. If the final tortillas are less than 50 percent Edison, aren\u2019t they just the restaurant equivalent of the imitation whole wheat from the grocery store? A month or so after touring the Bread Lab, I asked Jones one last time whether he was worried about compromising, now that his dream was giving way to an ambiguous reality. After all, this was a man who practiced daily communion with his wheat plants. His swift response surprised me: \u2018\u2018Our job at the Bread Lab is not to get all religious on 100-percent whole wheat.\u2019\u2019 Then he caught himself. \u2018\u2018Although,\u2019\u2019 he continued in a quieter voice, \u2018\u2018I guess we do.\u2019\u2019Ferris Jabr is a writer based in Portland, Ore.

{"Headline": "Nobel in Economics Given to Angus Deaton for Studies of Consumption", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economist Angus Deaton has devoted his career to improving the data that shape public policy, including measures of wealth and poverty, savings and consumption, health and happiness.Taking advantage of faster computers and an explosion of newly accessible information, he assembled the details of many individual lives to better understand the sweep of economic trends.On Monday around 6:10 a.m., when his wife handed him the telephone, Mr. Deaton, a professor at Princeton University, learned that he had won the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. Professor Deaton\u2019s name has appeared for years on lists of likely laureates even though he lacks a namesake theory or defining breakthrough. Despite his relative obscurity, his colleagues and peers said he deserved recognition for refining a rigorous approach to studying economic development based on careful consideration of detailed data.\u201cSuppose you wanted to understand the effect of a subsidy on rice on the well-being of farmers,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a Harvard professor of international political economy. \u201cHe has produced an approach that you can actually use with household data to trace through the effect of something like this on the well-being of different farmers.\u201dProfessor Deaton also has championed the collection and use of new kinds of data, particularly about developing countries that often lack the statistics readily available in the United States.\u201cSimple ways of looking at the world are often the basis of policy, and if the statements are wrong, then the policy may be wrong also,\u201d said the economist Janet M. Currie, a Princeton colleague. \u201cHe\u2019s always had a concern for trying to capture the complexity of the real world.\u201dProfessor Deaton, 69, was born in Scotland and educated at Cambridge before taking a job at Princeton in 1983. He is a British and American citizen.Professor Currie, a former student of Professor Deaton\u2019s and now his nominal boss as chairwoman of the economics department at Princeton, described him as \u201cenormously funny and witty and well read, frighteningly erudite and very good company.\u201dIn an interview on Monday, Professor Deaton said he had taken an interest in economic development because \u201cthere\u2019s a real moral urgency to understanding how people behave and what we should or might be able to do about it.\u201dHe said the circumstances of his upbringing also played a role.\u201cI grew up in Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a cold, messy and miserable place to grow up, and I dreamed of going to tropical, colorful, hot countries.\u201dPast Nobel Prizes have led to controversy, intrigue and, at times, serious second-guessing. Test your knowledge of the prizes.Economics before the 1980s relied on the assumption that the people represented by a large economic aggregate behaved in roughly the same way, not because that made sense but because accounting for diversity was too hard.Faster computers allowed the creation of models that incorporated differences in behavior. The Nobel committee cited Professor Deaton\u2019s work around 1980 in modeling demand for individual goods, which was both some of the earliest work in that vein and a model that remains in wide use.In continuing his research, he found that rising incomes tend to improve calorie intake for the poorest families, but the effect diminishes at higher income levels. Aggregate statistics, as a result, obscured the benefits of income gains for very poor families.\u201cWhat he\u2019s shown is that you do learn a great deal more by looking at the behavior that underlies the aggregates,\u201d said Duncan Thomas, an economist at Duke University and another former student.Professor Thomas said he also admired Professor Deaton\u2019s clarity. \u201cHe will bring evidence to the table in a way that makes you say, \u2018Well, of course that has to be right,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Professor Thomas said.He has perhaps contributed more to the disruption of old understandings than the creation of new ones.\u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of policy agnosticism that comes from this \u2014 it emphasizes more the heterogeneity of outcomes,\u201d Professor Rodrik said of Professor Deaton. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody with quite a sharp tongue, and he\u2019s often had as his target people who make very strong statements about this policy or that policy.\u201dProponents of foreign aid programs are a frequent target.

{"Headline": "Broadway Musicals, Big Draw in Brazil for a Decade, Lose Their Audience", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 After the curtain fell on opening night, Jos\u00e9 Possi Neto, the director of \u201cNice Work if You Can Get It,\u201d climbed to a rooftop terrace above the Teatro Cetip, high atop the traffic-clogged streets of Brazil\u2019s largest and wealthiest city, and pushed his way through 150 or so of the glitterati who had gathered to celebrate the show.Kissing cheeks and accepting praise from fellow members of the musical theater world, he gushed about the talent of his actors. He raved about the quality of Broadway shows that in recent years have flourished here in translation. Then, when asked about the future outlook for musicals, he balked: \u201cPessimism,\u201d he said in Portuguese, has taken root in Brazil.A decade of economic vibrancy, starting around the turn of this century, enriched Brazilians, who began to flock to Broadway productions, both in New York and in their country. S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities became prime destinations for New York producers looking to get more mileage out of their shows. They attracted new audiences from a population of some 200 million who grew up on the music and theatrics of Carnival and the melodrama of telenovelas.Before the recession, producers feverishly licensed musicals, and Brazilian television stars clamored for the prestige of starring in a Broadway import or a Brazilian original. As they have in many corners of the globe, \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d raked in millions south of the Equator, and even Broadway flops like \u201cChaplin\u201d and \u201cGhost\u201d found audiences here. And as attendance grew, new theaters rose (including one with 1,200 seats that is to open next month), and others were refurbished.In New York City, Brazilian tourists are among the fastest-growing segments of Broadway ticket buyers, and the second-largest group of overseas visitors to the city. (The British are first, while Brazilian tourists spent an estimated $2.3 billion last year, according to NYC & Company, the city\u2019s tourism marketing arm.)But the recession is chipping away at these gains. Producers in Brazil say ticket sales for musicals there have plummeted 20 to 30 percent across the industry this year. Time for Fun will mount fewer Broadway original productions than planned. Other producers are cutting ticket prices, or costs.The cast of \u201cThe Full Monty,\u201d which opened in Rio last week, rehearsed in a donated room of a barren mall. The producer and director, Tadeu Aguiar, reused sets and costumes from his other shows \u2014 although the police uniform stripper costumes were created from scratch. Instead of a salary, the cast was offered a cut of the box office. With no union to protect the actors, and unemployment surpassing 8 percent, \u201cthere are a lot of people who will do it for nothing,\u201d said one actor, Andr\u00e9 Dias.The musical \u2014 about unemployed workers in a depressed economy who turn to stripping for a living \u2014 will resonate in today\u2019s Brazil, he predicted: \u201cEvery Brazilian is trying to reinvent themselves. We are really living the story on the stage.\u201dAs the Brazilian real falls against the dollar \u2014 nearly 40 percent over the last year \u2014 fans of Broadway like Vanessa Bloomfield, a 42-year-old forestry engineer from Rio, are finding it harder to travel to New York.She expressed regret while standing in line alongside her mother at the waterfront Vivo Rio theater in Rio for the opening night of \u201cChaplin,\u201d a biographical musical about Charlie Chaplin that had a short Broadway run.On two trips to New York since 2011, Ms. Bloomfield said she saw \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d (twice).\u201cI would go right now, but my mom would have to pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the inflation, it\u2019s just too expensive.\u201dStill, interviews with over a dozen top musical theater producers in the United States, Europe and Brazil reveal that almost all remain bullish about the theater market in the long term. They argue that unlike theatergoers during the last major recession here, 25 years ago, when musicals were still an oddity, the audience is by now well established.\u201cBrazil has gone through a roller coaster during the last few years,\u201d said Peter O\u2019Keeffe, chief content officer at the Netherlands-based Stage Entertainment, which is currently presenting \u201cSister Act\u201d in S\u00e3o Paulo.Unalarmed, Mr. O\u2019Keeffe said this was typical of Latin American markets.\u201cA country drops off the map for a while and then comes back,\u201d he explained. \u201cBrazil is one of the strongest countries in Latin America. It\u2019s definitely not a death knell by any means.\u201dAmerican and Brazilian musical theater productions have been staged in Brazil for decades, but ticket sales began to rise after a 2001 production of \u201cLes Miserables\u201d in S\u00e3o Paulo, producers said.Unlike New York, Brazil is not a place where the box office alone can sustain shows. Sponsors \u2014 usually large companies \u2014 underwrite productions with tax-deductible payments to producers, in exchange for publicity.With sponsorship money drying up, producers are finding it harder to stage challenging work. Ask Cl\u00e1udio Botelho, who is dropping plans this year to produce \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d Stephen Sondheim\u2019s dark look at a murderous barber.Sounding not that different from a New York producer, he said: \u201cWhat sells now are musical comedies with the thrill of a big star. I wouldn\u2019t risk doing a different show, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t do a sad show at the moment.\u201dOld-fashioned American musicals, like \u201cNice Work,\u201d can still do well, as long as the task of translating English lyrics into Portuguese is done well, said Miguel Falabella, a producer, translator and television actor who plays the lead role of Jimmy Winter in the S\u00e3o Paulo production.As for the American locations and themes in \u201cNice Work,\u201d there\u2019s no need to tinker.\u201cA millionaire whose father is going to give him his chair in the Senate, and he\u2019s marrying a criminal \u2014 that\u2019s so Brazilian,\u201d Mr. Falabella said. \u201cThe audience loves it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Party\u2019s Strategy to Ignore Poverty", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneArizona, where I was born, in July became the first state to cut poor families\u2019 access to welfare assistance to a maximum of 12 months over a lifetime. That\u2019s a fifth of the time allowed under federal law, and means that 5,000 more people will lose their benefits by next June.This is only the latest tightening of the screws in Arizona. Last year, about 29,000 poor families received benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, 16,000 fewer than in 2005. In 2009, in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Depression of the 1930s, benefits were cut by 20 percent.A bit of history is necessary to understand how we reached this point. Two decades ago, when the Clinton administration agreed with a Republican-controlled Congress to \u201cend welfare as we know it,\u201d Washington replaced the poor\u2019s entitlement to aid from the federal government with a fixed block grant to states.Nonetheless, the block grant approach has emerged as the central plank of the Republican strategy to confront America\u2019s intractable poverty. The party\u2019s main presidential candidates have woven poverty and inequality into their campaign speeches. Nearly all of them are expected to show up in January at the Republican poverty summit meeting in Columbia, S.C., organized by Mr. Ryan, who has laid out detailed plans to overhaul what remains of the American social safety net.For all the talk about creating opportunity for the poor, and how ill-served they are by the current mix of government programs, it\u2019s hard to view these plans as anything but a bald effort to save money.But don\u2019t just take my word for it. Take it instead from Peter Germanis, one of the White House advisers who help write President Ronald Reagan\u2019s welfare reform proposal of 1986, called \u201cUp From Dependency.\u201d He has been affiliated with the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, both conservative advocacy and research organizations in Washington.\u201cTo the extent that anything I ever wrote contributed to the creation of TANF or any block grant, I am sorry,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I hope to demonstrate in this paper, a block grant for a safety net program is bad public policy.\u201dAnd he does. Among the easier charges to make against the Needy Families block grant is that it was not meant to adjust for inflation. It was $16.5 billion two decades ago; it is $16.5 billion today. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it has lost more than a third of its buying power.What\u2019s more, states were given both incentives and tools to redeploy the money to other priorities. Notably, they could get around the requirement to meet job participation benchmarks simply by reducing the caseloads of beneficiaries \u2014 almost a direct instruction to bump people off.\u201cStates did not uphold their end of the bargain,\u201d said Ron Haskins, an expert on welfare who worked for more than a decade for House Republicans. \u201cSo why do something like this again?\u201dArizona is a prime example of what has happened in states where Republicans rule. By now, only about nine out of every 100 poor families benefit from the cash welfare program, down from 55 percent two decades ago. This has nothing to do with the program\u2019s objective of helping poor adults with children escape the stigma of welfare and get a job, still the best antipoverty tool there is. Arizona simply needed the money for something else.Ending the poor\u2019s entitlement to government aid is counted as a success because it has reduced the rolls of people on welfare. But that is not the same as helping the poor get a job, overcome dependency and climb out of poverty. Welfare was essentially made irrelevant to the lives of the poor. It is meager yet increasingly difficult to get.Today only 26 percent of families with children in poverty receive welfare cash assistance. This is down from 68 percent two decades ago.This is what\u2019s most worrying about the block grant strategy to address the bane of poverty: It allows the assistance to wither while poverty survives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Immigration Dividend", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBut history provides some clarity about the relative costs and benefits of immigration over time. Fifty years ago this month, Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. By any standard, it made the United States a stronger nation. The act was endorsed by Republicans and Democrats in an era when cooperation was still possible. Indeed, the most serious opposition came from Southern Democrats and an ambivalent secretary of state, Dean Rusk. But it passed the Senate easily (76-18), with skillful leadership from its floor manager, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Johnson himself.Since 1924, United States immigration policy had been based on a formula, derived from the 1890 census, that made it relatively easy for Northern Europeans to immigrate. But the formula set strict limits for everyone else. That seemed ridiculous to John F. Kennedy, who was trying to win hearts and minds in the Cold War, and it seemed even more so to his successor in 1965, as Johnson was escalating the war in Vietnam. The act\u2019s passage was one of the few positive legacies of that complex moment in American foreign policy.Johnson promised his opponents that the act would \u201cnot reshape the structure of our daily lives.\u201d But that prediction proved utterly untrue. By destroying the old national-origins system, the act opened the floodgates to the parts of the world that had been excluded in the past.There is little doubt that the act succeeded in the ways that its progressive supporters hoped \u2014 it made America a genuinely New Frontier, younger and more diverse, truer to its ideals. But it also was a success when measured by a more conservative calculus of hard power. It certainly increased American security. Significant numbers of immigrants and their children joined the United States military after 1965, and in every category the armed forces became more ethnically diverse.Much of the growth of the last two decades has stemmed from the vast capacity that was delivered by the Internet and the personal computer, each of which was accelerated by immigrant ingenuity. Silicon Valley, especially, was transformed. In a state where Asian immigrants had once faced great hardship, they helped to transform the global economy. The 2010 census stated that more than 50 percent of technical workers in Silicon Valley are Asian-American.In countless other ways, as well, we might measure the improvements since 1965. A prominent AIDS researcher, David Ho, came to this country as a 12-year-old from Taiwan. Immigrants helped take the space program to new places, and sometimes gave their lives in that cause (an Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, perished in the Columbia space shuttle disaster). Almost no one would argue for a return to pre-1965 American cuisine, which became incomparably more interesting as it grew more diverse. Baseball has become a more dynamic game as it, too, has looked south and west. The list goes on and on.There will always be debates over immigration, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge that opponents of immigration are usually correct when they argue that immigration brings dramatic change. But a careful consideration of the 1965 Immigration Act shows that our willingness to lower barriers made this a better country. To convey that hard-earned wisdom to other nations wrestling with the same issues, and to open our own doors more widely, would be a modest way to repay the great contributions that immigrants have made on a daily basis to the United States over the past 50 years.Ted Widmer is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.

{"Headline": "In 3rd Quarter, Investors Rode the Rapids After Stocks Plunged", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA long stretch of unusual calm in the stock market gave way to a succession of violent swings in the third quarter as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at last and then were disappointed \u2014 after the briefest spurt of euphoria \u2014 when the Fed demurred.The net result was the worst quarter in four years, and some strategists predicted further trouble ahead.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t end happily,\u201d said Komal S. Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. \u201c2016 looks like a volatile and pretty difficult year for markets in the United States and around the globe.\u201dIt was certainly a difficult quarter. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 6.9 percent in the three months through September, closing at 1,920, roughly where the benchmark stood in May of last year.The decline was part of a broader trend toward shunning the risky assets that had been coveted for six-plus years. High-yield bonds fell, as did many commodities.Treasury prices rose as their yields fell during the quarter, with the return on the benchmark 10-year note dropping to 2.04 percent from 2.35 percent at the end of the previous quarter. Treasuries are often a safe harbor during turbulent market conditions, and with the Fed maintaining its target for short-term rates at zero to 0.25 percent, as it has for nearly a decade, traders saw no reason to expect the outlook for long-term rates to change anytime soon.If Wall Street seems unwilling to take yes for an answer, investment advisers say, it\u2019s because the Fed\u2019s welcome caution in raising rates is more than offset by the fact that the Fed sees so much to be cautious about.\u201cThe market didn\u2019t expect a rate hike, and it didn\u2019t get one,\u201d said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust. \u201cThe problem is the tone of the minutes and press conference that suggested the Fed is worried more about the global growth outlook than previously. That\u2019s really spooking the market.\u201dLaird R. Landmann, co-head of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, agreed that central bankers were unnerving investors and suggested that they might have given themselves the jitters, too.\u201cThere\u2019s a mind-set that has developed at the Fed where they\u2019re waiting for a perfect moment that never comes,\u201d he said.With or without the Fed\u2019s help, enough happened in the third quarter to leave owners of stock funds feeling a bit twitchy. The average domestic portfolio fell 7.8 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by specialists in energy and other natural resources, communications and technology.\u201cThere are yellow lights flashing out there in terms of the global economy, but there\u2019s no deterioration in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Stephen E. Kylander, manager of the RBC Mid Cap Value fund.That should be good news for small and medium-size companies. They depend on foreign markets for a smaller proportion of their sales than big companies do, but they benefit just as much from lower interest rates. Yet mid- and small-capitalization funds underperformed in the third quarter: Midcap portfolios lost 9.4 percent and small caps lost 10.8 percent.One reason for the weakness, Mr. Kylander said, is that while smaller companies tend to have a domestic focus, many would like to gain a foothold overseas and cannot.But he sees value in market segments that offer decent dividend income, like utilities and commercial real estate investment trusts, and in domestically focused industries like trucking.Shareholders in international stock funds used the third quarter mainly as an opportunity to sell, driving the average one down 10 percent. Europe displayed newfound stability over the summer as Greece ceased to be an urgent problem for the moment, but that was more than offset by deteriorating conditions in emerging markets. Funds that specialize in Latin America, Asia and diversified emerging markets had average losses of 12.8 percent or more.Chinese stocks had an awful quarter; funds that focus on the country plunged 20.9 percent. The economic malaise there continued and may have contributed to the decline in American stocks and the limited relief experienced when the Fed stood pat.China is a huge exporter, and with the decline in the renminbi it has begun to export deflation to other developing countries, forcing them into a difficult, maybe hopeless, position. If they weaken their currencies to match the renminbi devaluation, the burden of their immense dollar-denominated debt will grow when expressed in their own currencies. If they keep their currencies relatively strong, however, their exports will become less competitive.\u201cThere is no room for them to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. He expects the developing countries to devalue, even if it leads to credit downgrades, defaults and difficulty in refinancing debt for corporate and government borrowers.\u201cThey will have to go through with it to have fewer negative effects on competitiveness,\u201d he predicted.It\u2019s a no-win situation. Mr. Sri-Kumar noted that emerging markets accounted for more than half of global economic output. They\u2019re not the small, exotic growth stories of 10 or 20 years ago.If those countries slow because of this crisis, \u201ceventually it\u2019s going to reverberate back to the United States,\u201d he said.Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted a year ago that the Fed would hold rates steady this year, and fragility in the developing world has persuaded him to extend his forecast through 2016. That could leave the stock market in a bad spot, in his view, as investors, desensitized to the putative benefits of ultra-easy monetary policy after nearly a decade, sell into any short-lived rally after the Fed postpones a rate increase, as it did last month.He recommends sheltering in high-quality bonds and blue-chip stocks that pay generous dividends.Nothing goes down forever. At some point, perhaps in the first quarter, emerging stock markets will be cheap enough to present a low-risk buying opportunity, he said.Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, expects a shorter wait for the Fed to move.\u201cThe Fed is still looking at raising interest rates at some point in the coming months,\u201d she said.Ms. Patterson encourages investors to have a relatively heavy allocation in American stocks while they wait, particularly in financial services and consumer discretionary companies, and remain light in emerging markets and energy. She would also be comparatively light in bonds, although she finds mortgage-backed securities to be sound bets, she said, because they are less sensitive to rising rates and she detects consistent improvement in the housing market.Ms. Nixon at Northern Trust has a similar view of American and emerging markets: heavy in the first, light in the second. She also advocates a more modest than usual bond allocation. As for the Fed, it \u201cwants to get off the zero,\u201d she said, but \u201cthe job isn\u2019t going to get any easier\u201d given the global backdrop. So \u201cif the Fed hikes, it may be one and done,\u201d she said.Mr. Landmann at TCW contends that the Fed is content to keep rates where they are.\u201cThey\u2019re looking for reasons not to tighten,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, at any given meeting coming up, that we have more than a 50-50 chance of tightening if things stay as they are.\u201dBut with rates so low, Mr. Landmann cautioned, if conditions deteriorate in China and elsewhere and begin to weigh more heavily on the American economy and markets, there will be little the Fed can do. For six years, investors have bought stocks after declines. Now might be a good time to sell after rallies, he advised.\u201cIf you\u2019re a conservative, value-oriented investor, when prices go up you want to use it as an opportunity to take risk out of your portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cAsset prices can\u2019t stay high forever. There may be decent returns for the next quarter as the Fed stays on hold, but even that won\u2019t work after a while. The rest of the world may take matters into their own hands. It may not matter what the Fed does.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Is Chilly to Puerto Rico\u2019s Pleas and Obama\u2019s Aid Plan", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Officials from debt-plagued Puerto Rico, hoping for some comfort and sympathy \u2014 and even practical advice \u2014 from senators at a committee hearing in Washington on Thursday, got little of it.And the Obama administration\u2019s proposal for helping the island out of its financial fix got no love either. (The Treasury Department, which outlined the plan for reporters Wednesday night, officially presented it to the Senate Energy and Natural Affairs Committee on Thursday.)Mr. Sanders said he had heard that some of the bonds the island is in danger of defaulting on might have been issued illegally and perhaps could be torn up. \u201cShould debt be repaid if it was incurred in an unconstitutional way?\u201d he asked, harking back to an argument that changed the course of Detroit\u2019s historic bankruptcy. Whether that was true in Puerto Rico\u2019s case was unclear.And Ms. Warren said she would fight for a new debt restructuring framework for Puerto Rico but chastised the Treasury Department for offering a plan she found unimpressive.But mostly, the committee was critical of Puerto Rico officials, including Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, who testified at the hearing, for providing what it said were confusing and out-of-date numbers that failed to give a full understanding of the island\u2019s balance sheet.Nobody, however, seemed to dispute that the finances were in a mess, that people were suffering and that the threat of a major default was real. Nobody, that is, except some of the island\u2019s creditors, who, while not at the hearing, have been insisting from the sidelines that the island\u2019s financial health is really not as dire as portrayed and that predictions of a collapse are overdrawn, meant to provide political cover for a government that can\u2019t get its act together well enough to pay its bondholders.One creditor said he thought the Treasury was also painting too bleak a picture to attract attention and support.\u201cThe Treasury\u2019s own numbers are mixing and matching,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality requirements. He said he had combed through the Treasury\u2019s outline of its proposal and spotted what he said was a miscalculation \u2014 the outline said debt payments were running close to 40 percent of the island\u2019s budget, but an apples-to-apples comparison would be 15 percent. It is easy to confuse the numbers because the debt is so complex.Melba Acosta Febo, president of the island\u2019s Government Development Bank, attended the hearing but did not testify. She said afterward that with or without help from Washington, Puerto Rico would move forward as best it could and would begin restructuring talks with the holders of about $48 billion of debt in November. The island\u2019s total debt has a face value of more than $72 billion, with a payment of more than $300 million coming due on Dec. 1.Ms. Acosta Febo said the coming negotiations would include certain bonds secured with very powerful pledges, and added that it would be much easier if Puerto Rico had even limited access to the bankruptcy courts. The general plan is to slow down scheduled payments due to creditors, and use the money saved that way to restore sustainable growth over five years. Once the economy is growing again, the government is to have a new debt payment schedule that is more manageable.The senators said that federal money was short everywhere, however, and that they would have to cut other spending to pay for even a limited rescue of Puerto Rico, so they needed to know how much.\u201cWe do want to be helpful, but in order to be helpful we need more information,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, closely echoing the sentiments expressed by her counterpart and fellow Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who led a hearing on the Puerto Rican debt crisis two weeks ago.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said it was \u201ca misconception\u201d that Puerto Rico was withholding critical financial information \u2014 a \u201cred herring\u201d being spread by \u201cthose with vested interests in seeing Congress defer taking action, so as to force Puerto Rico into a disorderly default.\u201dHe said that hedge funds had made short-term bets on the outcome of Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis, and that they had \u201cliterally spent millions of dollars on a coordinated lobbying campaign to propagate disinformation of this type.\u201dIn the last six months, the governor said, Puerto Rico had disclosed more financial information than at any time in its history, hiring experts from the world of sovereign debt to produce its first long-term fiscal projections and analysis. He also disputed the idea that Puerto Rico was begging for a handout.\u201cWe have never asked Congress for a bailout, and we are not seeking one today,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said, in his first congressional testimony since he announced in June that his government would seek a debt moratorium. \u201cWe are asking for a framework to restructure our debt.\u201dBut Senator Murkowski persisted.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a comprehensive, independent audit since 2013,\u201d she said. While the long-term fiscal analysis and a recent liquidity report were useful, she said, there was no substitute for the credibility that audited financial statements could impart. \u201cWhat\u2019s the status?\u201d she asked.The governor said that he was already leaning heavily on the outside auditors to finish the overdue reports, and that if he pressed too hard, they might make mistakes. He also said his government had inherited antiquated computers and messy data sets that were hard to work with. He said he thought the 2014 audit would be available next week, but that only prompted Ms. Murkowski to say she wanted the 2015 audit too. (Puerto Rico\u2019s 2015 fiscal year ended on June 30.)Ms. Murkowski then turned to Antonio Weiss, the Treasury counselor who led the administration\u2019s months-long effort to draft a feasible rescue plan for Puerto Rico.\u201cAre you satisfied with the information that is available?\u201d Ms. Murkowski asked him.\u201cIt is absolutely the case that Puerto Rico needs to make an investment in its reporting systems,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. He said the administration\u2019s proposal called for Congress to establish independent fiscal oversight for Puerto Rico and that \u201cbetter I.T. infrastructure would go with that.\u201dDemocratic senators at the hearing made it clear that they were deeply concerned about some hedge funds betting on Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis and the possibility that they were seeking to influence the rescue plan in order to maximize profits.Mr. Sanders said that what he termed \u201cvulture funds\u201d had been buying up Puerto Rico\u2019s debt for as little as 30 cents on the dollar.\u201cWhy should they get 100 percent of their investment when they are paying 30 to 70 percent for their bonds?\u201d he said.Mr. Weiss said that some debt securities were yielding 11 percent.\u201cWhoa!\u201d Mr. Sanders exclaimed. \u201cThey are receiving 11 percent and children in Puerto Rico are going hungry. That, for me, is not an equation that works.\u201dIt was then that Mr. Sanders asked if some of the debt had been issued unlawfully. One witness, Sergio M. Marxuach of Puerto Rico\u2019s Center for a New Economy, noted after the hearing that the island\u2019s Constitution requires any budget holes to be filled by raising taxes. Puerto Rico, he said, has gone for years issuing debt and using the proceeds to plug holes \u2014 pretending, in effect, that debt is revenue.\u201cIs there a legal case? Well, that requires more research,\u201d Mr. Marxuach said, noting that members of Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature have been looking into possible irregularities in the issuance of the island\u2019s debt.Judge Rhodes has since retired and is now serving as a consultant to Puerto Rico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Fantasy Sports, Signs of Insiders\u2019 Edge", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeeks before a leak of inside information led state investigators to question whether daily fantasy football games were a fraud, misleading thousands of players vying for millions of dollars in prize money, Madison Calvert, a regular player, became suspicious.At a private party for DraftKings, one of the biggest daily fantasy websites, Calvert said, he discussed his baseball contest choices with a host, Jon Aguiar, an executive of the site, who suddenly made a quick check on his phone and, to Calvert\u2019s surprise, informed him that his pick of a pitcher was a poor choice because many other players had selected him.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pulled that up in front of you, ha-ha,\u201d Calvert said Aguiar told him.That was days after Calvert, 29, had repeatedly been challenged for head-to-head play in another game, on the website FanDuel, by a Rick Sawyer. After checking a search engine, Calvert said, he found that Sawyer was actually a business planning manager at DraftKings.\u201cI could only think that he had watched my DraftKings account and had me pegged as a suboptimal player,\u201d Calvert said. \u201cI felt like a moron.\u201dCalvert said it was \u201cpretty obvious that with insider information and access to top players,\u201d players like him would not have a chance in the long run.Calvert is not the only one raising doubts about the clubby, cozy connections between the two companies at the head of the booming, unregulated, multibillion-dollar daily fantasy industry, in which players pay a fee on a website, assemble virtual rosters of players and then, in pursuit of jackpots ranging from $22 to $2 million, score points based on the real-world outcomes of professional games.But records and interviews show a long-held pattern of overlapping interests and close relationships among employees at the companies \u2014 many of whom regularly rank among the most consistent big winners \u2014 and in some cases investors, which include Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and two N.F.L. owners, as well as media giants like NBC, its parent Comcast and Fox.Andre Bessette, a manger of analytics at DraftKings, is currently ranked No. 40 and won a $50,000 first prize in a FanDuel contest, the 2015 World Fantasy Hockey Championship.A look at how daily fantasy football is played.Employees BarredBoth companies have announced that they have permanently barred their employees from competing in daily fantasy sports and have brought in high-profile former federal prosecutors to conduct an independent investigation. ESPN dropped segments sponsored by daily fantasy sites.DraftKings, which issued a statement Friday seeking to reassure fans about the integrity of the game, declined to make Aguiar or Sawyer available for comment, as well as other employees who have kept a high profile on the competitive daily fantasy circuit. The company said it would not respond to detailed questions about its employees or policies while its internal investigation was underway.\u201cOur objective is to be completely transparent with our findings, and we expect that we will be able to report on the results of that review in the next few weeks,\u201d it said in a statement.Likewise, FanDuel said it would have no further comment on its employees or practices.Yet both companies have acknowledged that they recruited many of their employees from the pool of devoted daily fantasy sports enthusiasts and allowed them to play the games, in the kind of potential conflict of interest generally avoided in other industries that handle sensitive information.Last month at a conference at Babson College near Boston, a DraftKings founder, Paul Liberman, said barring employees from playing could make it difficult to retain talent.\u201cWe have some people who make significantly more money off of our competitors\u2019 sites than they do working for DraftKings,\u201d he said.In fact, Aguiar, a former professional poker player and an early star in daily fantasy sports, was brought into DraftKings to court top players in an effort to expand the high end of the business.To lure everyday players and stoke big hopes, the sites depend on these big-winning sharks, as the highly skilled and large-volume players are known. Part-time minnows and other low-volume enthusiasts who do not win much make up most of the rest of the field, similar to the situation at casinos.Advertisements for both companies feature 20-somethings near tears after winning life-changing bounties, but the fine print on the television ads states that winnings actually average $22.A recent study in Sports Business Daily found that over the first half of this year\u2019s Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of daily fantasy sports player profits were won by just 1.3 percent of the players. In fact, on average, the top 11 players paid $2 million in entry fees and made profits of $135,000 each while accounting for 17 percent of all entry fees.Many of those players use automated processes that let them change hundreds, if not thousands, of lineups in seconds, a decided advantage when last-minute changes are made in the real lineups of professional football, basketball or baseball teams.\u201cIt\u2019s a great recreational game, but financially it\u2019s not a wise investment for people,\u201d said Dan Singer, who leads the sports and gambling practice at the consulting giant McKinsey & Company and was an author of the Sports Business Daily study.Charting Top PlayersOn RotoGrinders, a site that closely follows the fantasy sports industry, the exploits of the top players \u2014 many of them employees of DraftKings or FanDuel \u2014 are charted, ranked and followed in fan-boy fashion. Neither company would say how much its employees had won, but Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for FanDuel, said DraftKings employees had won less than $10 million in her company\u2019s contests.There have also been complaints that some of the automated programs can exploit weaker players by identifying them and getting into competitions with them ahead of everyone else.DraftKings declined to discuss its policies on using automated processes, which are called scripting. FanDuel said that it had put some restrictions on the programs \u2014 including prohibiting last-minute automated lineup changes \u2014 but that it reviewed requests for them individually.Access to inside information by employees of the two companies has been questioned before in forums, in part because neither DraftKings nor FanDuel has given any details on what safeguards are in place to protect their data.Leonard Don Diego first worked at FanDuel but is now an engagement manager at DraftKings. A year ago, he was accused of sharing lineups, according to a RotoGrinders thread.Don Diego denied that he had passed on information.The recent scandal was ignited after Ethan Haskell, a DraftKings employee, admitted to releasing inside information.In promotional pictures for the site, he looks like those rapturous winners holding oversize checks in the company\u2019s television commercials. He has a ball cap on backward and a loving-life grin that might appeal to the many young postcollege players who dominate the demographic that is powering daily fantasy sports\u2019 growth.More than a week ago, Haskell admitted on a blog post that he had released \u201cplayer owned percentages\u201d \u2014 by mistake, he said \u2014 before all the lineups for the third week of N.F.L. games were locked up. The data showed which players \u2014 included in more than 400,000 entries \u2014 were most commonly selected in lineups submitted to the site\u2019s Millionaire Maker contest.That week, he won $350,000 on the rival FanDuel site, but DraftKings said he had done so without benefit of inside information. He also won one of 120 seats at FanDuel\u2019s $12 million World Fantasy Football Championship. There he will have the opportunity to win a $3 million first-place check, and he is guaranteed at least $20,000 for showing up, even if he finishes last.\u201cWhen there are no internal controls to keep your employees in check in terms of what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s understandable that many of them would become preoccupied with trying to also just win money playing fantasy sports,\u201d Albertson said. DraftKings and FanDuel are each valued at more than $1 billion and have begun incessant and costly television advertising campaigns to persuade viewers that anyone with an interest in sports can become a millionaire. The networks and sports leagues so far have been stalwart investors or willing partners in sponsorship agreements.Neither company, however, has turned a profit.\u201cIf you are going to purport you are a billion-dollar business, and advertise on billboards and televisions throughout the country, you need to act like a billion-dollar business,\u201d said Marc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College and Fordham University and an expert on fantasy sports. \u201cAnd that includes, among other things, putting in place very sophisticated firewalls and controls to prevent these types of instances from happening in the first place.\u201dCalling It QuitsCalvert, 29, had never thought of himself as a minnow, as part-time fantasy sports players are known. He was lured into daily fantasy six months ago and played more than 9,000 games in many sports, well enough to earn \u201cV.I.P.\u201d status at DraftKings. He said he had played mainly in tournaments with small buy-ins and once had a $9,000 weekend. Over all, however, Calvert said, he lost more than he won.On Sunday, for the first time in many weekends, he watched N.F.L. games simply as a spectator.\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d said Calvert, who is married and works in sales.By the measures of Singer\u2019s study, Calvert was a big fish among the 5 percent of players who, on average, lost $1,100 on entry fees of $3,600. The true minnows account for 80 percent of the millions of daily players, and they lost, on average, $25 on entry fees of $49.\u201cThe minnows may lose $10 a month and will happily continue to play forever,\u201d Singer said. \u201cBut the entire fantasy economy depends on keeping those few big fish.\u201dAfter the insider trading allegations surfaced, Calvert emailed Jason Robins, DraftKings\u2019 chief executive and a co-founder, with his complaints. Two days went by without a response.\u201cPlease know how grateful we are for the passion and loyalty you have shown DraftKings throughout our history and especially over the past week,\u201d it said. \u201cYou remain our greatest priority.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Monday about the success of DraftKings and FanDuel employees in playing daily fantasy sports games misspelled the surname of a DraftKings founder in some copies. He is Paul Liberman, not Lieberman. The article also misspelled, in some copies, the given name of a successful player in daily fantasy sports who said he pushed the companies to regulate themselves. He is Cory Albertson, not Corey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Leads a Quiet Revolution", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyWith its progressive politics, high-tech bent and abundant sunshine, California is fast ramping up its production of clean electricity, setting an example its leaders hope the rest of the country, and other nations, will follow as they seek to cut emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of California in terms of renewables,\u201d said William Nelson, head of North American analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s like an experiment in terms of how quickly we can add solar to the grid.\u201dFifteen years after an energy crisis, caused partly by deregulation and market manipulation, brought blackouts and price spikes, the shift has been remarkably smooth, many analysts say. Even without counting the big contribution from home solar generation, 26 percent of the state\u2019s power this year will come from clean sources like the sun and wind, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates. The national average is about 10 percent.Contracts already in place virtually guarantee that the state will reach its goal of getting 33 percent of electricity from renewables by 2020, a number that does not include most home generation. And at the rate California has been going, a new target of 50 percent for 2030 is within reach, Mr. Nelson said.A new industry of home solar panel installation and financing, spearheaded by companies like SolarCity and Sunrun, has sprung up in California, and many of those companies have expanded elsewhere in the country, Mr. Nelson said.\u201cIt\u2019s a breeding ground of activity that is impacting other states,\u201d he said.California is not alone, of course, in its push toward renewables. Germany gets about 30 percent of its power from clean sources; Denmark has passed 40 percent and is aiming for 100 percent by 2050.There have been difficulties. The big influx of solar and wind power has changed the hour-to-hour pattern of electricity production, with energy flooding the grid during the sunniest times, creating a mismatch with demand that has sometimes forced officials to temporarily switch off energy from the new sources.The storage technologies that would help ease that imbalance are still too expensive to use widely, although California is requiring utilities to install 1.3 gigawatts of power storage by 2020.New transmission lines are needed to keep up with the construction of solar and wind farms, and so are high-tech natural gas plants able to switch on and off quickly to complement the fluctuations of the sun and wind.But so far the infusion of new clean energy has not caused reliability problems, as some critics had feared it might, said David Olsen, a governor on the board of the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\u2019s electric grid.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen no impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we get to 40 percent, 50 percent, that will definitely be an issue. But we know what the technical issues are and we\u2019re planning for them. We\u2019re highly confident that we will be able to operate the grid reliably when it is dominated by renewable energy.\u201dThe incentives and regulations driving the change are underpinned by an order in 2005 by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that California slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. In April, Gov. Jerry Brown added an interim target of a 40 percent emissions cut by 2030, also based on 1990 levels.Last month, legislators wrote into law Mr. Brown\u2019s goal of getting 50 percent of power from clean sources by 2030, although pressure from the oil industry forced the governor\u2019s allies to drop a related piece of their climate package, a requirement to halve petroleum use.Fong Wan, senior vice president for energy policy and procurement at Pacific Gas & Electric, said that while the utility supported the carbon-cutting goals, it wanted more freedom to decide how to reach them. Rather than mandating specific percentages of renewable power, he said, regulations should focus on the overriding goal of cutting emissions.\u201cWe would like the flexibility to choose how to accomplish\u201d those cuts, he said. \u201cWe are concerned with the unintended consequences or outcome if you have very specific goals, because you may end up with a suboptimal solution.\u201dAnother utility priority has sparked a battle with the growing solar rooftop sector. Big providers like PG&E are losing revenue from customers who generate their own power, enjoying smaller monthly bills while still drawing on grid electricity at times. The utilities want those customers to pay a larger share of the cost of maintaining electricity lines and plants.Regulators are considering revising rates to address that concern, angering rooftop panel companies who warn that a package of changes proposed by utilities would gut their industry and undermine California\u2019s position as a climate leader.Others predict the clean energy targets will harm the wider economy.The chamber, he said, would rather see a \u201ccap and trade\u201d approach that lets the market find the best way of cutting greenhouse gases. California has such an emissions trading system, but it currently has little impact on electricity, making a bigger difference in other areas, like the price of gasoline.Officials say the renewables push has helped, not hurt, the economy.\u201cWe have successfully delinked G.D.P. from carbon, and what that means is that we have had continued economic growth, we added 498,000 jobs, more jobs than any other state in the country in 2014, and at the same time we have greatly reduced carbon emissions,\u201d Kevin de Le\u00f3n, president pro tempore of the state senate, said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Chinese, the Mexicans, the European Union, the Indians are watching what happens\u201d in California.Chinese officials, working on their own enormous renewables program, have consulted with the state\u2019s energy experts. California\u2019s grid operator is helping Mexico set up its own independent grid-management body, Mr. Olsen said. And with every state required by President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to create a roadmap for cutting its carbon emissions, many are likely to look more closely at California\u2019s efforts.That impact, said Mr. Kammen of the University of California, Berkeley, will be critical if California\u2019s work is to make a real difference in slowing the pace of climate change.\u201cThe lessons from the Californias, the Denmarks, the Germanys have to really spread,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do us much good if a few places are really green, if the overall trajectory doesn\u2019t change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subway Extension Provides a Link to Hudson Yards, Still a Work in Progress", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Gertrude Stein were to ride the No. 7 train to the new end of its line on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, she might again declare that there is no there there. Not yet, anyway.Riders emerging from the station find themselves in the center of what is supposed to be a thriving agglomeration of office towers, stores and high-rise apartment buildings. What they find today, though, is an urban park surrounded by construction sites, some bustling, some yet to roar to life.What they will not find is a lot of commercial activity, not yet at least. Virtually all of the businesses that operated in the neighborhood \u2014 mostly light industrial and manufacturing shops \u2014 have been displaced. In their stead, developers plan to install fancy department stores, boutiques and restaurants.Related Companies, which owns the 28-acre Hudson Yards development, on Wednesday topped out the first office building there, an 895-foot tower that will house the offices of Coach and L\u2019Oreal. Related also acquired one of the last parcels it had sought, the longtime site of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant on 10th Avenue.\u201cWithout the station, there wouldn\u2019t be a Hudson Yards,\u201d said Christine Berthet, a neighborhood resident who is chairwoman of Community Board 4. \u201cBecause there is the Hudson Yards station, now you can see all these cranes and all this frantic activity to build all around it. Everything follows from that.\u201dMs. Berthet said she had already changed her travel habits, walking west to use the new station when possible, instead of wending her way through the crowded blocks around the Times Square subway station.\u201cIt\u2019s such a nicer experience that I would at this point prefer to go there,\u201d she said, citing the \u201cgreen space\u201d around the new station as an antidote to what she encounters in Midtown. \u201cNarrow sidewalks, a lot of traffic, a lot of honking, a lot of crowds. As a pedestrian, it\u2019s very stressful.\u201dBut peace and quiet were not the aims of the rezoning that paved the way for Hudson Yards \u2014 spurring economic activity was the goal.The administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg believed the development would add so much to the city\u2019s economy that it justified the unusual step of having the city pay for an extension of the state-run subway system. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s aides argued that the development would generate enough additional tax revenue and other fees to cover the debt payments on $3 billion in bonds.The city has paid more than $350 million in interest on those bonds, but Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor, said that was a small down payment on a plan that could generate nearly $30 billion in taxes and other payments to the city over the next 30 years. The overall economic impact of the entire redevelopment will amount to a multiple of that sum, which he said was derived from a detailed analysis conducted by him and Michael N. Meola, a real estate consultant.Mr. Meola said the conclusion was that the city would not have to subsidize any more payments to the Hudson Yards bondholders and that as soon as 2019, the city will receive more in annual payments from developers in the Hudson Yards district than the $153 million a year it owes in interest on the bonds.\u201cI think the investment in the No. 7 line and the related infrastructure of Hudson Yards may be the single best investment the city has ever made in terms of the returns that it gets in terms of incremental tax revenue,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said.Of course, not everybody is so supportive, especially the owners of some businesses that were uprooted to make room for the redevelopment.Steven Silver, the president of New York Wood Tank Company, said the city had unfairly used its power of eminent domain to displace his family\u2019s businesses, which include American Pipe and Tank. The Silvers had been installing and repairing rooftop water tanks throughout Manhattan from their location on West 35th Street for decades before they were forced to find a new base of operations, Mr. Silver said.Now, he said, he has to commute from his home in Midtown to the company\u2019s new location in Long Island City, Queens, and then send his workers across the East River into Manhattan. He said more than 90 percent of the company\u2019s customers were in Manhattan, which made its new location much less convenient. Compounding his unhappiness is a continuing dispute with the city over the compensation the family received for their property, he said.No fan of the redevelopment plan, Mr. Silver said he drove through the Hudson Yards area frequently but had not visited the new subway station. He said he had not yet seen any reason to go there.Among the few businesses operating in Hudson Yards that have already benefited from the opening of the station are two discount intercity-bus services, Megabus and Bolt Bus.The companies that run them had picked up and dropped off passengers near Pennsylvania Station. But after receiving complaints about the big buses adding to the congestion of Midtown, city officials relocated them in 2012 to the Far West Side, a long walk from the nearest subway station.\u201cFor years they were not happy that we asked them to move,\u201d Ms. Berthet said of Megabus and Bolt Bus. \u201cOur argument was, you are going to be right at the subway when it opens. I\u2019m sure that, right now, they are really happy with it.\u201d\u201cWe are thrilled to be where we are and thrilled to be right by the subway station,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. He said that it was too soon to tell how much the closer link to the transit system would help Megabus, which he said carried more than 1 million passengers to the city annually.Mr. Hughes said the company hoped that the neighborhood rising around it would not become inhospitable to the riders who line up on the sidewalk of 34th Street near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. \u201cWe have no plans on moving any time soon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Suffocations in Truck Near Hungary Reveal Tactics of Smugglers", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNICKELSDORF, Austria \u2014 Austrian police officers found pungent fluid dripping from the back door of a meat truck that had been abandoned on a highway near the Hungarian border. Counting the tangled and decomposing bodies inside took the authorities more than a day.Seventy-one migrants, four of them children, suffocated within about 90 minutes after they squeezed into the truck\u2019s airless refrigeration chamber more than 24 hours earlier, investigators concluded.The 71 deaths remained shrouded in mystery. All but a handful of the migrants had traveled without passports in the hope of starting new lives, and the Austrian police have waited to match fingerprints or DNA samples. The authorities have so far confirmed the identities of only about half the dead \u2014 migrants originally from the cities of Qamishli and Deir al-Zour in Syria, and Erbil and Sulaimaniya in Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region.The migrants did not start out helpless or na\u00efve, their families say. In interviews in six cities across Turkey, Iraq and Austria, the families of more than a dozen of the dead said that many of the migrants were affluent and educated. They paid to mitigate the risks of the journey, and they died with money in their pockets.The story of their deaths illustrates the manipulations that smugglers use to exploit the psychology of even the most resourceful migrants, leaving them far more desperate and vulnerable than when they began.Almost all their relatives insisted, despite the evidence, that the migrants knew better than to get into the back of a crowded truck \u2014 even a truck that was better ventilated.\u201cIt is impossible,\u201d said Hassan Khalid, 30, a Syrian from Qamishli now living in Erbil, whose two brothers died in the truck.The older of the brothers, Hussein Khalid, 34, was an archaeology graduate student who wanted to reach Germany to complete his doctorate and brought along a younger brother and a family friend. \u201cHe is well educated and very careful, and he talked to a lot of people who had made that trip,\u201d Mr. Khalid said. \u201cEveryone agreed: Never get on a truck.\u201dIn Internet-telephone calls home, Hussein told his family that he had insisted on a sturdy \u201cyacht\u201d instead of a raft to cross the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece, at a premium price of $1,800 per person. He made his way from the boat to Belgrade, Serbia, without the help of any smuggler.He sent home a photograph of himself lounging with his feet up in a Belgrade bunkhouse where the three men were renting beds for $12 a night, and he left relaxed and confident audio messages for his family weighing whether to hire a smuggler for the final leg of their journey.They hired one just to be safe, he told his family, to navigate the aggressive border security of the Hungarian police. The family said Hussein paid about $1,800 a person to a smuggler named Karwan el-Sulmani, who promised a passenger car ride all the way to Germany. Hussein had about $4,300 left in his possession when he entered the truck, his brothers said.More than 20 of the 71 dead migrants came from the oil-rich Kurdistan region of Iraq, a relatively stable and prosperous area that remains a destination for job seekers from India, Pakistan, Africa and elsewhere.Several families there said that they had made advance payments of as much as $4,500 to a local smuggling agent working with Mr. Sulmani. The agent does business under the name \u201cJamal Guarantee\u201d \u2014 although none of the interviewed families of his dead migrant clients have recovered their initial payments.In recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.To avoid the risk of a Mediterranean passage, four friends from the same neighborhood of large, comfortable homes in Sulaimaniya paid the smugglers an extra premium \u2014 about $9,000 to $11,000 each \u2014 to travel by land north from Turkey through Bulgaria. \u201cWe paid more to go the safe way,\u201d said Jamal Hussein, 49, whose son Shwan Jamal Hussein, 23, died in the truck.His father insisted that Shwan had driven a truck himself and \u201cknew he could not survive it.\u201dAnother of the four, Osman Mohamed, 35, was a well-paid employee at a telecommunications company who also owned his own mobile phone shop. He wanted to go to Germany for medical treatment for kidney stones, his family said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with money,\u201d said his brother, Bahman Mohamed, 33.A third, Zardasht Mohamed Abdulla, 28, who also died in the truck, left behind a bus parked in front of his home that his family had bought him for $27,500 \u2014 more than double the average annual income in Kurdistan.The four friends were detained at a camp in Bulgaria for 26 days but continued on their journey with the same smugglers to Belgrade. The four sent home pictures of themselves smiling in sweaters in a lush Serbian forest.In Serbia, they set their sights on Germany, which is known for its generosity to asylum seekers. They agreed to pay Mr. Sulmani, the Kurdish smuggler, an additional $680 each for a car ride to get there. None of the smugglers answered phone calls seeking comment.Until this summer, smugglers typically charged migrants by the carload, as in a taxi, said Gerald Tatzgern, director of the human trafficking division of the Austrian police. \u201cNormally a smuggler might have gotten 500 euros per car,\u201d he said, about $566.But with the exploding numbers this summer, smugglers began charging per head instead of per vehicle. \u201cThey said, \u2018What about 500 euros per person?\u2019 And the migrants opened up their rucksacks and paid!\u201d Mr. Tatzgern said. \u201cThis is a good business.\u201dThe economies of scale created an incentive to jam migrants into the back of ill-suited freight vehicles, and the profitable work attracted street criminals with little experience. \u201cThey stopped shoplifting. They stopped pickpocketing. Now they are smugglers,\u201d Mr. Tatzgern said.The police and migrants both say that smugglers who load the trucks now routinely hide the faces of the drivers. That way the drivers can abandon the trucks without fear of identification.So many freight trucks full of migrants have been making the journey across Hungary that at least three others were discovered in the same 48 hours as the meat truck full of corpses. A truck containing 86 migrants was stopped in Germany, and the Austrian police found one with 81 migrants and the other with about 25, abandoned near the border with Hungary, according to the police and migrants. (All survived.)All of the families interviewed said that they last spoke with the migrants on the evening of Aug. 25, and that all had expected a car ride to Germany.The four friends from Sulaimaniya had passed the previous night walking hours through a forest across the border from Serbia to Hungary. Osman Mohamed, speaking by telephone from a Hungarian forest, sounded exhausted and desperate, said his brother, Bahman.\u201c \u2018Come back, forget about the money,\u2019 \u201d Bahman said he told Osman, reminding him that the family had plenty.But after paying extra to travel by land and spending four weeks detained in Bulgaria, Osman felt he had come too far already. \u201cThere is no way I am going back,\u201d he said, according to his brother. \u201cEven if the last way is by sea, I am going to take it!\u201dThe latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.Psychologists say the impulse is understandable. \u201cWhen you are deciding whether to leave your country or not, the idea of going into a poorly ventilated truck might seem absurd,\u201d Stephen D. Reicher, a social psychologist at St. Andrews University, in Scotland, wrote in an email. \u201cIt threatens an extreme loss (of life) when you aren\u2019t even convinced of the overall gain of leaving.\u201dBut when a migrant nears his destination, the choice becomes \u201cwhether to fail, to have wasted all the efforts and risks involved so far, or else to take a further risk and to possibly succeed,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are far more likely to take the latter risk.\u201dSeven members of the Sheikh family of Deir al-Zour, Syria, traveled together from the cities of Mersin and Urfa in Turkey. They were from one of their city\u2019s most affluent and respected families before the civil war, and they brought along four friends from their hometown.All 11 survived the Mediterranean passage by boat from Turkey, then the tear gas and clubs of the Macedonian border police. They rented hotel rooms in Belgrade on the night of Aug. 23, and their smuggler, known as Abdel Malek al-Afghani, arranged four taxis to go toward the Hungarian border.But the driver of one taxi inexplicably changed course and deposited Yusuf el-Sheikh, 39, with a teenage niece and nephew somewhere in the woods near the border. The Austrian police say smugglers often seek to divide migrant families with such tricks, to keep them tractable.After a night in the forest, Yusuf spent the last of his cash on a taxi back to Belgrade. His oldest brother, Abdel Salem, 55, was carrying the rest of their money.When the two brothers reached each other by telephone the next day, Abdel reported that he was trapped somewhere in a Hungarian forest. The police had surrounded the migrants, he said, and the family was running out of food and water.\u201cI told my brother, \u2018Please come back; you have to come back,\u2019 because I had a bad feeling,\u201d Yusuf recalled in an interview. He and his teenage niece and nephew slept the night in a park in Belgrade.Then, about 6 p.m. on Aug. 25, Abdel Salem called to say that they could wait no longer. The smuggler was bringing cars to take them to Germany, he told Yusuf.Mr. Afghani, the smuggler, called Yusuf a short time later. Another taxi picked up him and the teenagers near a bridge across the Danube and drove them toward the border, and this time Mr. Afghani led them with a group of about 60 on a seven-hour walk through the night deep into Hungary. They slept the next day in a crowded safe house somewhere in Hungary.The next night, on Aug. 26, Mr. Afghani led Yusuf and about 25 others bound for Germany on a short walk to a road. Three of the migrants were younger than 5, Yusuf said, and Mr. Afghani said he would return with cars. But instead he pulled up with a truck. \u201cHe just came back and said, \u2018Get in,\u2019 \u201d Yusuf recalled.They would be packed standing together without room to sit for what was expected to be a nine-hour drive, Yusuf said. He worried they would be unable to breathe.\u201cWe just wanted the journey to be over, and we kept asking, \u2018Where is our family?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sheikh recalled in a recent interview, in Vienna. \u201cThe smuggler told us, \u2018You are going to meet them in Germany.\u2019 \u201dYusuf got in and survived. The Austrian police found the truck abandoned the next morning and let out the passengers.His brother Abdel Salem had made a similar choice with a different result. Abdel Salem, his wife, a 23-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter were among the 71 migrants found dead the same day in the meat truck.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Mersin and Urfa, Turkey; Kamil Kakol from Erbil and Sulaimaniya, Iraq; and Salomea Krobath from Vienna and Eisenstadt, Austria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grim Jobs Report Is Likely to Delay a Move by the Fed on Rates", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnexpectedly dismal job growth last month cast a shadow on the nation\u2019s economy, as a government report on Friday sent analysts scrambling for adjectives like \u201cdreadful,\u201d \u201ca body blow\u201d and \u201cgrim\u201d to describe just how disappointing they found the latest employment figures.The Labor Department found that the jobless rate held steady at 5.1 percent in September, but wage gains stalled, the labor force shrank and employers created many fewer positions than they had been averaging in recent months. While the latest report is only a snapshot of the economy and the weakness may ultimately prove fleeting, it made clear that ordinary workers are still failing to take home the kind of monetary rewards normally expected from a recovery that has being going on for more than six years.The odds of a move in December have \u201cclearly diminished,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good in this morning\u2019s report.\u201dDespite the lagging economy, the mere likelihood that the Fed would yet again postpone a retreat on its stimulus program may have ultimately buoyed some investors\u2019 confidence. After opening sharply down after the Labor Department\u2019s announcement, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned around, ending the day up over 1.4 percent, to 1,951.36. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond dipped below 2 percent.\u201cThat may assure the markets that unconditional support from monetary policy will be sustained,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said. \u201cLow for long may go on even longer.\u201dDiane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, had \u201creally made it clear that she\u2019d like to re-engage those sidelined in recent years by allowing the unemployment rate to fall below what most consider full employment. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to regain living standards lost in recent years.\u201dThe Fed faces an uphill battle, she and other analysts suggested, as the United States now appears to be importing some of the economic malaise that has infected other parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.Ms. Swonk, who labeled the employment numbers a \u201cbody blow,\u201d warned that the economy was likely to be plagued by subpar growth for a while.By contrast, health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services remained strong, highlighting other signs of sturdiness in the economy that countered the otherwise disheartening jobs news.Consumer demand at home has been on the upswing and vehicle sales have been strong. And a broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, dipped to 10 percent in September, its lowest mark since May 2008.\u201cAgainst the backdrop of accelerating real consumption, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s driving this softening and what could sustain it,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sounding a more optimistic note. \u201cWe have to expect better numbers next month, and the odds still strongly favor upward revisions, despite the unexpected downward revision to August.\u201dBut Mr. Shepherdson was drowned out by a chorus of more negative reactions to the estimate that employers created only 142,000 jobs in September. Adding to the gloom, the Labor Department revised August\u2019s employment numbers, registering only 136,000 new jobs for that month, well below the 173,000 originally reported.With Friday\u2019s revision, job gains have averaged just 167,000 a month for the last three months, compared with an average of about 260,000 for 2014. Average hourly wages in the private sector dropped slightly, as did the average length of the workweek.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.With the presidential campaign already underway, neither party wasted much time in using the jobs report to attack the other side.Republicans criticized the president for promoting a program that they argue stifles economic growth. The slowdown may provide a political opening for Republican contenders to attack Mr. Obama and the Democrats on an issue that was not resonating as much with voters when the job market was on the upswing.In response, President Obama vowed on Friday not to sign another temporary spending measure after the one passed this week in an effort to raise the pressure on Congress to reach a long-term agreement to finance the government.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Obama warned that the economy could be endangered by the continual game of budget chicken encouraged by conservative Republicans in hopes of forcing Democrats to give ground on other issues, like health care and the fate of Planned Parenthood.The short-term spending bill passed this week to pay for government operations only until Dec. 11, he said, was a \u201cgimmick\u201d that \u201csets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not the way the U.S. should be operating.\u201dTo prevent a recurrence, he said he would veto any further budget measures postponing a full-fledged spending plan. \u201cI will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe purchased ourselves another 10 weeks. We need to use them.\u201dWhile overall growth remains on a slow but steady track, the job outlook varies markedly depending on geography, training and industry.Looking at the feeble rise in median wages, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, pointed out that such figures masked a wide disparity among industries. Workers in financial services, construction and graphic design, for example, have on average enjoyed double-digit wage growth from the previous year. Those stuck in neutral or suffering from effective wage declines included those in the manufacturing, retail clothing and textile industries.The demand for young, high-technology workers has been evident to Isaac Oates, the chief executive of Justworks, a human resources management company that handles mostly small businesses. \u201cWe see that a lot of companies are growing quickly\u201d in this area, saying his own firm has grown to 60 workers from 40 over the past three months in order to keep pace.Other industries, like travel and leisure, have proved more resilient job creators, even if wages have not grown much. An improving housing market has also helped push down the number of unemployed workers with construction experience to its lowest level since 2000, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. The picture is bleaker for those in the low-skill corners of the economy.\u201cWe\u2019re still finding a lot of skilled jobs come open, but it\u2019s certainly slowed down for the unskilled,\u201d said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City with 750 offices.Skilled workers are at a premium at Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing consulting company based in Peoria, Ill. \u201cWhere we\u2019re struggling is in the area of talented people in manufacturing,\u201d Jeff Owens, the company\u2019s president, said, mentioning that he would like to add about 160 managers, electricians, information technology workers and machinists to his 3,300-person staff.Location also matters. Mr. Funk, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he observed a slowing down in the last six weeks, with the biggest drop-offs in the oil-drilling states, including Texas, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota.Others fear that the economy is never going to deliver many gains to workers who have been waiting years to receive any bounty from the upswing in business activity.William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much reached a kind of stability, and the unemployment rate will continue to fall, mostly because of retirements.\u201dPublic sector jobs were one of the few bright spots, growing by 24,000 in September, thanks to hiring on the state and local level. But government workers \u2014 from teachers to police officers to transit workers \u2014 have not made up the lost ground, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization in Washington.\u201cThe number of teachers and education staff fell dramatically during the recession,\u201d Ms. Gould said, \u201cand has failed to recover to anywhere near its prerecession level, let alone the level that would be required to keep up with an expanding student population.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the economy. It is heading into the final quarter of 2015, of course \u2014 not 2016.Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Or would she, once in the White House, return to the finance-friendly, deregulatory policies of the 1990s?Well, if Wall Street\u2019s attitude and its political giving are any indication, financiers themselves believe that any Democrat, Mrs. Clinton very much included, would be serious about policing their industry\u2019s excesses. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing all they can to elect a Republican.To understand the politics of financial reform and regulation, we have to start by acknowledging that there was a time when Wall Street and Democrats got on just fine. Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs became Bill Clinton\u2019s most influential economic official; big banks had plenty of political access; and the industry by and large got what it wanted, including repeal of Glass-Steagall.This cozy relationship was reflected in campaign contributions, with the securities industry splitting its donations more or less evenly between the parties, and hedge funds actually leaning Democratic.But then came the financial crisis of 2008, and everything changed.Many liberals feel that the Obama administration was far too lenient on the financial industry in the aftermath of the crisis. After all, runaway banks brought the economy to its knees, causing millions to lose their jobs, their homes, or both. What\u2019s more, banks themselves were bailed out, at potentially large expense to taxpayers (although in the end the costs weren\u2019t very large). Yet nobody went to jail, and the big banks weren\u2019t broken up.Partly this reflects hurt feelings. By any normal standard, President Obama has been remarkably restrained in his criticisms of Wall Street. But with great wealth comes great pettiness: These are men accustomed to obsequious deference, and they took even mild comments about bad behavior by some of their number as an unforgivable insult.As I said, this lopsided giving is an indication that Wall Street insiders take Democratic pledges to crack down on bankers\u2019 excesses seriously. And it also means that a victorious Democrat wouldn\u2019t owe much to the financial industry.If a Democrat does win, does it matter much which one it is? Probably not. Any Democrat is likely to retain the financial reforms of 2010, and seek to stiffen them where possible. But major new reforms will be blocked until and unless Democrats regain control of both houses of Congress, which isn\u2019t likely to happen for a long time.In other words, while there are some differences in financial policy between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, as a practical matter they\u2019re trivial compared with the yawning gulf with Republicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Families Funding the 2016 Presidential Election", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "They are overwhelmingly white, rich, older and male, in a nation that is being remade by the young, by women, and by black and brown voters. Across a sprawling country, they reside in an archipelago of wealth, exclusive neighborhoods dotting a handful of cities and towns. And in an economy that has minted billionaires in a dizzying array of industries, most made their fortunes in just two: finance and energy.These donors\u2019 fortunes reflect the shifting composition of the country\u2019s economic elite. Relatively few work in the traditional ranks of corporate America, or hail from dynasties of inherited wealth. Most built their own businesses, parlaying talent and an appetite for risk into huge wealth: They founded hedge funds in New York, bought up undervalued oil leases in Texas, made blockbusters in Hollywood. More than a dozen of the elite donors were born outside the United States, immigrating from countries like Cuba, the old Soviet Union, Pakistan, India and Israel.But regardless of industry, the families investing the most in presidential politics overwhelmingly lean right, contributing tens of millions of dollars to support Republican candidates who have pledged to pare regulations; cut taxes on income, capital gains and inheritances; and shrink entitlement programs. While such measures would help protect their own wealth, the donors describe their embrace of them more broadly, as the surest means of promoting economic growth and preserving a system that would allow others to prosper, too.Republicans138Democrats20Republicans138Democrats20\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of families around the country who are self-made who feel like over-regulation puts these burdens on smaller companies,\u201d said Doug Deason, a Dallas investor whose family put $5 million behind Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and now, after Mr. Perry\u2019s exit, is being courted by many of the remaining candidates. \u201cThey\u2019ve done well. They want to see other people do well.\u201dIn marshaling their financial resources chiefly behind Republican candidates, the donors are also serving as a kind of financial check on demographic forces that have been nudging the electorate toward support for the Democratic Party and its economic policies. Two-thirds of Americans support higher taxes on those earning $1 million or more a year, according to a June New York Times/CBS News poll, while six in 10 favor more government intervention to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly seven in 10 favor preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits as they are.Republican candidates have struggled to improve their standing with Hispanic voters, women and African-Americans. But as the campaign unfolds, Republicans are far outpacing Democrats in exploiting the world of \u201csuper PACs,\u201d which, unlike candidates\u2019 own campaigns, can raise unlimited sums from any donor, and which have so far amassed the bulk of the money in the election.The 158 families each contributed $250,000 or more in the campaign through June 30, according to the most recent available Federal Election Commission filings and other data, while an additional 200 families gave more than $100,000. Together, the two groups contributed well over half the money in the presidential election -- the vast majority of it supporting Republicans.\u201cThe campaign finance system is now a countervailing force to the way the actual voters of the country are evolving and the policies they want,\u201d said Ruy Teixeira, a political and demographic expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Like most of the ultrawealthy, the new donor elite is deeply private. Very few of those contacted were willing to speak about their contributions or their political views. Many donations were made from business addresses or post office boxes, or wound through limited liability corporations or trusts, exploiting the new avenues opened up by Citizens United, which gave corporate entities far more leeway to spend money on behalf of candidates. Some contributors, for reasons of privacy or tax planning, are not listed as the owners of the homes where they live, further obscuring the family and social ties that bind them.But interviews and a review of hundreds of public documents \u2014 voter registrations, business records, F.E.C. data and more \u2014 reveal a class apart, distant from much of America while geographically, socially and economically intermingling among themselves. Nearly all the neighborhoods where they live would fit within the city limits of New Orleans. But minorities make up less than one-fifth of those neighborhoods\u2019 collective population, and virtually no one is black. Their residents make four and a half times the salary of the average American, and are twice as likely to be college educated.Most of the families are clustered around just nine cities. Many are neighbors, living near one another in neighborhoods like Bel Air and Brentwood in Los Angeles; River Oaks, a Houston community popular with energy executives; or Indian Creek Village, a private island near Miami that has a private security force and just 35 homes lining an 18-hole golf course.Sometimes, across party lines, they are patrons of the same symphonies, art museums or at-risk youth programs. They are business partners, in-laws and, on occasion, even poker buddies.RIVER OAKSCOUNTRY CLUBHOUSTONHalf a mileHildebrand FamilyDonated $250,000Nau FamilyDonated $500,000Sarofim FamilyDonated $530,000Flores FamilyDonated $250,000RIVER OAKSCOUNTRY CLUBHOUSTONHalf a mileMcNair FamilyDonated $2 millionAnsary FamilyDonated $2 millionKinder FamilyDonated $2 millionKrohn FamilyDonated $250,000More than 50 members of these families have made the Forbes 400 list of the country\u2019s top billionaires, marking a scale of wealth against which even a million-dollar political contribution can seem relatively small.

In finance, they started hedge funds, or formed private equity and venture capital firms, benefiting from favorable tax treatment of debt and capital gains, and more recently from a rising stock market and low interest rates. In energy, some were latter-day wildcatters, early to capitalize on the new drilling technologies and high energy prices that made it economical to exploit shale formations in North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Others made fortunes supplying those wildcatters with pipelines, trucks and equipment for \u201cfracking.\u201dIn both energy and finance, their businesses, when successful, could throw off enormous amounts of cash \u2014 unlike industries in which wealth might have been tied up in investments. Those without shareholders or boards of directors have had unusual freedom to indulge their political passions. Together, the two industries accounted for well over half of the cash contributed by the top 158 families.Self-made wealth119Inherited wealth37Self-made wealth119Inherited wealth37\u201cWhen I look at these families, these are highly successful people, they\u2019re used to moving mountains, and they love to beat the conventional wisdom,\u201d said David McCurdy, a former Oklahoma congressman who is now president of the American Gas Association.Indeed, while blue-chip corporations largely shy away from super PACs, wary of negative publicity about unlimited campaign spending, these families have poured millions of dollars into such efforts.Some are even betting on candidates shunned by their party\u2019s traditional donor establishment. The three families who have provided the largest donations in the campaign to date \u2014 the Wilks family of Texas, which made billions providing trucks and equipment in the shale fields; the Mercers of New York, headed by the hedge fund investor Robert Mercer; and Toby Neugebauer, a Texas-born private equity investor \u2014 have backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a socially conservative Tea Party firebrand disdained by Republican leaders.\u201cMaking a big bet on something before anyone else really grasps it. That is what success has in common in energy and in equities,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch.\u201cMost of the people at the Koch seminars are entrepreneurs who have built it from the ground up \u2014 they built it themselves,\u201d said Mr. Deason, who said he supported eliminating corporate subsidies and welfare, including those that benefit his own investments.Another group of the families, including the hedge fund investor George Soros and his son Jonathan, have ties to the Democracy Alliance, a network of liberal donors who have pushed Democrats to move aggressively on climate change legislation and progressive taxation. Those donors, many of them from Hollywood or Wall Street, have put millions of dollars behind Hillary Rodham Clinton.The families who give do so, to some extent, because of personal, regional and professional ties to the candidates. Jeb Bush\u2019s father made money in the oil business, while Mr. Bush himself earned millions of dollars on Wall Street. Some of the candidates most popular among ultrawealthy donors have also served in elected office in Florida and Texas, two states that are home to many of the affluent families on the list.But the giving, more broadly, reflects the political stakes this year for the families and businesses that have moved most aggressively to take advantage of Citizens United, particularly in the energy and finance industries.The Obama administration, Democrats in Congress and even Mr. Bush have argued for tax and regulatory shifts that could subject many venture capital and private equity firms to higher levels of corporate or investment taxation. Hedge funds, which historically were lightly regulated, are bound by new rules with the Dodd-Frank regulations, which several Republican candidates have pledged to roll back and which Mrs. Clinton has pledged to defend.And while the shale boom has generated new fortunes, it has also produced a glut of oil that is now driving down prices. Most in the industry favor lifting the 40-year-old ban on exporting oil, which would give domestic producers access to new customers overseas, and approval of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.\u201cThey don\u2019t want anything from the government except that they\u2019d like to export oil, and most of them want the Keystone pipeline,\u201d T. Boone Pickens, the investor and natural gas advocate, said about his colleagues in the energy business.\u201cIf you look at the oil and gas industry, it has done wonders for the country. They paid a lot of taxes, and people still attack you,\u201d said Mr. Pickens, who has donated $125,000 to groups supporting Mr. Bush or Carly Fiorina. \u201cThey\u2019re entrepreneurs, and they have opinions about everything.\u201dSources: F.E.C. and I.R.S. filings; voter registrations; property assessment and deed records; corporate filings.

But when you are talking about children and seniors, it\u2019s not sustainable. So more emphasis is being placed on fresh food and nutritious food.\u201dIn Westchester, where agriculture long ago gave way to bedroom communities and corporate office parks, the food bank faces a greater challenge in identifying available land. But it now produces 9,200 pounds of produce annually, on land belonging to institutions and groups like School for the Deaf, the county\u2019s juvenile detention center and the Westchester Land Trust.Overseeing that effort is Douglass DeCandia, the food bank\u2019s growing program coordinator. Driving from site to site in his faded Subaru (with a \u201cNo Farms, No Food\u201d bumper sticker), he works with students, corporate volunteers and juvenile offenders to coax eggplants, tomatoes, kale, potatoes, chili peppers, beans and Swiss chard from the land.At Woodfield Cottage, the maximum-security juvenile detention center in Valhalla, he can work with only one person at a time. \u201cThat one-to-one is really good because it\u2019s much more intimate,\u201d said Mr. DeCandia, 29, who studied sustainable agriculture in college. He recently harvested perfectly round eggplants and bright red hot peppers from the one-acre plot at Woodfield, which is hemmed in by a tall, black security fence.At School for the Deaf, by contrast, groups of students work together in the three-fourths-acre field, which produces 3,000 pounds of food a year. Mr. DeCandia has made a point of cultivating heirloom varieties of vegetables, like red, yellow, purple and sweet potatoes.\u201cThere are hundreds of varieties of potatoes, but we\u2019ve gotten so used to seeing just white potatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that variety are all the vitamins and nutrients.\u201dDr. Stern, the school superintendent, quipped: \u201cWe don\u2019t grow couch potatoes here.\u201dIndeed, Justin Van Dunk, a 16-year-old student, was crouched over the turnip bed. \u201cYou get the whole root,\u201d he said, as he thinned the crop with his classmates. \u201cIf they\u2019re too crowded, they are stuck in the ground.\u201dOne challenge for the food bank is prodding residents to try vegetables they may never have seen. The food bank has 160 partners, among them churches, YMCAs and other groups, to help distribute the food. And it employs two nutritionists who come up with recipes for chard, kale and other vegetables that are made available at the distribution sites.Students at School for the Deaf are also learning about less familiar herbs and vegetables, from Jerusalem artichokes \u2014 a species of sunflower that resembles small potatoes \u2014 to comfrey, a perennial herb that can be used to make tea and herbal remedies. Some of the flowers and herbs are grown to attract honeybees, since the food bank cannot keep bees at the farm sites.While almost all of the produce goes straight to the food bank, some is kept for the school\u2019s staff cafe.\u201cThis allows the students to make an association between what they see at the supermarket and what comes from the earth,\u201d said Carol Rapport-Sommer, director of special programs and services at School for the Deaf, where the garden is now in its third season. \u201cIt\u2019s multi-sensory learning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Keeps Interest Rates Near Zero, but Says Economic Indicators Remain Strong", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Fed said on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it would keep rates near zero for now, as expected, but it added an unusually explicit statement that it would consider raising rates at its final meeting of the year in mid-December.Fed officials are struggling to decide whether the economy can tolerate higher interest rates, as growth continues to wobble along rather than power ahead on a clear upward path.Some risks to the economy have diminished in recent weeks: Global markets have regained a measure of equanimity, and Washington has averted another fiscal policy showdown. But there are signs that domestic growth has weakened, including a slower pace of job creation.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.\u201cEverything will come down to the incoming data between now and mid-December,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said on Wednesday after the Fed revealed its latest thinking.The Fed\u2019s message appeared to make an impression on investors who had written off the chances of a December liftoff. The yield on two-year Treasuries, which is closely tied to interest rate expectations, rose to 0.707 percent Wednesday from 0.617 percent Tuesday.Equity indexes dropped sharply after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. but then made up the lost ground and then some. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.18 percent to 2,090.35 on the day.The odds of a December rate increase, derived from asset prices, rose from about 1 in 3 before the meeting to about 1 in 2 by the end of the day. But some investors remained skeptical that the Fed would act, noting that it has been reliably overconfident in its economic forecasts.\u201cThe Fed wants us to believe that it did not go in June and September, when the economy had a stronger pulse than it does now, but it is really seriously considering December,\u201d the French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe Chair Yellen will go along with this in the end,\u201d it continued, referring to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.The Fed\u2019s decision to delay liftoff until at least mid-December means that short-term rates will remain near zero for a seventh full year. By keeping rates so low, the Fed is encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, which it hopes will translate into faster economic growth. Raising rates, conversely, is likely to weigh on growth by increasing the cost of borrowing.Wednesday\u2019s decision was supported by nine of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted to raise rates, as he did in September.The looming question now is whether the Fed will raise rates at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for Dec. 15 and 16.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have predicted for years \u2014 and reiterated in recent weeks \u2014 that they expected to start raising rates in 2015.The case for raising rates hinges in part on the Fed\u2019s forecast that the economy will continue to add jobs at a healthy pace and that inflation will begin to rise more quickly. Moreover, some analysts argue that maintaining near-zero interest rates is now doing more harm than good by encouraging businesses to invest in things like share buybacks to lift their stock price, rather than long-term investments in equipment and developing new products.The rebound in financial markets after a rocky late summer has removed one obstacle from the Fed\u2019s path. In the statement issued after its previous meeting in September, the Fed said global economic and financial developments might restrain domestic growth. That language was stripped from the new statement, leaving only an acknowledgment the Fed \u201cis monitoring global economic and financial developments.\u201dBut the Fed indicated that it was a little more worried about the domestic economy. The statement said \u201ceconomic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,\u201d forgoing the present tense \u2014 \u201cis expanding\u201d \u2014 that it used in September. And the Fed specifically said that job growth, a primary focus, had weakened in recent months, although the statement added that officials expect a rebound.\u201cIn short, Fed officials are specifically highlighting the potential for tightening as soon as the December meeting,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThey seem less worried about global headwinds but the slowing in payrolls in the last two reports has got their attention.\u201dInflation, however, remains weak, and Ms. Yellen is facing opposition from a small but significant minority of Fed officials \u2014 including three of the 10 voting members of the policy committee \u2014 who say the Fed should not move until it sees clear evidence of inflationary pressures. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, emphasized the importance of global forces in a recent speech.Liberal economists and activists \u2014 including some former Obama administration officials \u2014 also continue to warn that raising rates in December would be a mistake because millions of Americans are still looking for jobs and there are no signs that inflation poses a threat.New economic data in the coming weeks could determine relatively quickly whether December remains a plausible option. The government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of third-quarter growth on Thursday, followed next week by an even more important indicator, the estimate of October job growth. The Fed policy-making committee will also have the Labor Department\u2019s report on the November job market before it meets again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Health Care Proposals, Focused on Cost, Go Well Beyond Obama\u2019s", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Obama has spent five years minimizing cost issues still confronting many health care consumers. Mrs. Clinton is taking those on without apologies. She would go beyond the president\u2019s 2010 law, capping a patient\u2019s share of the bill for doctor visits and prescription drugs. She would repeal the law\u2019s planned tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance \u2014 a tax the White House says is needed to constrain the growth of health spending.And Mrs. Clinton, like Bill Clinton when he was president, appears to be more willing to confront insurers and drug makers over high prices. She said she would seek \u201cauthority to block or modify unreasonable health insurance rate increases\u201d and stop \u201cexcessive profiteering\u201d by drug companies.Those comments echoed her criticism of the industry 22 years ago. As chief architect of her husband\u2019s plan to remake the nation\u2019s health care system in 1993, she accused insurance and pharmaceutical companies of \u201cprice gouging\u201d and \u201cunconscionable profiteering.\u201d\u201cHealth care is one of highest-ranking issues she hears about over and over,\u201d said Chris Jennings, an informal adviser to Mrs. Clinton who worked on health issues in the Clinton White House.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recent comments surprised and irked Obama administration officials. A White House spokeswoman said that, to her knowledge, the Clinton campaign had not consulted the administration.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Even as she proposed changes in the health law, Mrs. Clinton said it was working, and she promised to fight Republican efforts to dismantle it. Republicans said she was trying to have it both ways, embracing popular parts of the law while rejecting those that are unpopular.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health policy proposals were calculated to appeal to Democratic voters and labor unions who might be tempted to support Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her main rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. Many unions say the Cadillac tax, scheduled to take effect in 2018, will hurt their members, including schoolteachers and factory workers who gave up higher wages to secure generous health benefits.But her aggressive approach is nothing new. The health care plan she drafted for her husband, as presented to Congress in 1993, had the same goals as Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, but it took a more aggressive regulatory approach. The government would have set lower limits on out-of-pocket costs and provided more generous subsidies to many consumers and employers. A new agency, the National Health Board, would have set a health budget for the nation and would have regulated most private insurance premiums. And \u201cregional health alliances\u201d would have been responsible for collecting premiums and could have set fee schedules for doctors.Mrs. Clinton revealed her opposition to the Cadillac tax five days after a dozen senators introduced legislation to repeal it. Among the senators were Mr. Sanders, who has support from many rank-and-file union members, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, who is expected to take over as Democratic leader with the retirement of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada next year.Mr. Obama has long boasted about the law\u2019s provisions that hold down consumer costs. The law imposes limits on out-of-pocket costs and requires insurers to cover preventive services, like vaccinations and cancer screenings, at no cost to consumers.And the big rate increases sought by some health insurance companies for 2016 are less significant than they appear, administration officials maintain, because most people buying insurance through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s public exchanges receive federal subsidies that cover most of the premium. They do not need to worry about the \u201clist prices,\u201d officials said, and if they do, they can switch to less expensive plans.But Mrs. Clinton said that many families still struggled with medical costs. She wants Congress to give them financial assistance: tax credits up to $2,500 a year for an individual and $5,000 for a family if out-of-pocket health costs exceed 5 percent of income.Each insurer sets its own limits on out-of-pocket costs, up to a federally imposed maximum. The limits this year cannot be more than $6,600 for an individual plan and $13,200 for a family plan.The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to disclose the costs to consumers of specific medical services, but the Obama administration has yet to enforce that requirement, disappointing consumer advocates who say the data would be useful to patients.Mrs. Clinton said she would \u201cvigorously enforce\u201d these provisions and broaden them so consumers could make more informed choices about coverage and save money.The Obama administration does post information about the benefits and costs of different health plans, but making comparisons can be difficult because the plans do not use a standard definition of deductible \u2014 the amount that consumers owe before their insurance begins to pay.Mrs. Clinton would go further than the law\u2019s guarantee of free preventive health services and would require insurers and employers to cover three \u201csick visits\u201d a year without charging a deductible.Under her proposal, Mrs. Clinton said, consumers would not have to pay those extra charges for care at hospitals in their health plan\u2019s network.In a series of reports in recent years, the Obama administration has cited data to show that health costs were growing at the slowest rate in decades. But that overall trend may stem in part from costs landing directly on patients, causing them not to seek needed care, experts said.\u201cOne way to lower premiums is to increase deductibles, shifting costs back to consumers,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. \u201cMrs. Clinton worries that high deductibles lead to the underuse of necessary medical care.\u201dNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a longtime confidante of Mrs. Clinton, said the health care law poses a challenge for Democrats. The law, she said, has expanded coverage and slowed the growth of national health spending, both major achievements.But, Ms. Tanden said, \u201cconsumers feel their costs have risen\u201d because wages are stagnant and many employers have required workers to shoulder a greater share of their medical expenses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nationwide Test Shows Dip in Students\u2019 Math Abilities", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time since 1990, the mathematical skills of American students have dropped, according to results of a nationwide test released by the Education Department on Wednesday.The dip in scores comes as the country\u2019s employers demand workers with ever-stronger skills in mathematics to compete in a global economy. It also comes as states grapple with the new Common Core academic standards and a rebellion against them.Progress in reading, which has been generally more muted than in math for decades, also stalled this year as scores among fourth graders flat-lined and eighth-grade scores decreased. The exams assess a representative sampling of students on math and reading skills in public and private schools.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we should completely freak out,\u201d he added. \u201cThis could be a one-time variation, and maybe we\u2019ll see things come back next time. But if it were the beginning of a new trend, it would be quite disappointing and disturbing.\u201dEducation officials said that the first-time decline in math scores was unexpected, but that it could be related to changes ushered in by the Common Core standards, which have been adopted by more than 40 states. For example, some of the fourth-grade math questions on data analysis, statistics and geometry are not part of that grade\u2019s guidelines under the Common Core and so might not have been covered in class. The largest score drops on the fourth-grade math exams were on questions related to those topics.The stagnating performance could also reflect the demographic changes sweeping America\u2019s schools and the persistent achievement gap between white students and minorities, as well as between students from poor families and their more affluent peers.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual when you see lots of different things happening in classrooms to first see a slight decline before you see improvement,\u201d said William J. Bushaw, the executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policies and achievement levels for the tests.About a quarter of public school students are Hispanic, compared with fewer than 10 percent in 1990. As a group, the scores of Hispanic students trail those of white students; this year, for example, 21 percent of Hispanic fourth graders scored at a level deemed proficient or above on reading tests, compared with 46 percent of white students.The proportion of African-American students in public schools has remained fairly stable, but an achievement gap with white students remains. On the fourth-grade reading tests this year, just 18 percent of black students were deemed proficient.America\u2019s schoolchildren are also increasingly poor. Students from poor families often arrive at school with smaller vocabularies than students from middle-class or more affluent households, and are faced with challenges like hunger, homelessness and parents working several jobs, all of which can interfere with their learning in school and the academic support they receive at home \u2014 and ultimately their test scores.The average fourth-grade math score this year was 240 on a scale of 500, down from 242 in 2013, the last time the federal assessment results were released. The average eighth-grade math score was 282, down from 285 two years ago.In reading, the average fourth-grade score of 223, compared with 222 in 2013, was not a statistically significant difference. The average eighth-grade score fell to 265 from 268.No state or any of the 21 urban school districts that participated in the tests raised scores in both subjects and grade levels. But the District of Columbia repeated some of the strength it showed in 2013 by raising fourth-grade reading and math scores and holding eighth-grade reading and math scores steady. Kaya Henderson, the public schools chancellor, attributed the progress to strong teacher recruitment and training, preschool for 90 percent of the district\u2019s 4-year-olds and a new mandatory curriculum.In New York State and New York City schools, math scores on the national tests fell in fourth grade but held steady in eighth grade, while reading scores were flat in both grades throughout the state and in the city.As states have adopted the Common Core \u2014 guidelines for what students should know and be able to do between kindergarten and high school \u2014 many teachers have adjusted their curriculum and instructional methods, particularly in math. Students are asked to use math to solve real-life problems and find different ways to come at the same answer rather than simply repeating formulas.Some educators suggested that some of the changes have sowed confusion among teachers and students that could be reflected in the national test scores. \u201cRight now, what\u2019s going on in many states is a wholesale change in math instruction,\u201d said Daniel Koretz, a professor of education at Harvard. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with that in classrooms.\u201d\u201cKnowing other kinds of math isn\u2019t going to help you unless you\u2019ve been taught it,\u201d said Fran Stancavage, an author of the study. \u201cThe Common Core moves the sequence around, so there are lots of things that used to be taught before fourth grade that are now showing up in higher grades.\u201dRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, linked the drop in test scores to recent educational policies as well as the economic downturn and its aftermath. \u201cOf course we are disappointed\u201d with the scores, she said. \u201cBut they should give pause to anyone who still wishes to double down on austerity and make competition, scapegoating teachers, closing rather than fixing schools, driving fear, and testing and sanctioning the dominant education strategies.\u201dOn Saturday, the Obama administration acknowledged that high-stakes testing had proliferated too far and urged states and school districts to cut down on the number of tests and make them more purposeful.But with students taking so many other standardized tests, some educators said those who took the national exams, which were administered from January to March, may simply have had test fatigue. Protests about testing as well as decisions by some parents to opt their students out of testing could have influenced some students who took the national exams.\u201cIf I was a student, it would be hard to know which ones to take seriously,\u201d said Chris Minnich, the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, which represents state education commissioners. \u201cI know at that point we were all talking about opting out and lots of different things were going on, and this was another test that showed up in classrooms across the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disciple Strikes Back: Rubio Bests Bush in a Key Moment", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was 21 minutes into the Republican presidential debate and Jeb Bush, the professed statesman of this year\u2019s Republican field, had to do something.Donors and strategists have scolded him for his political passivity and polls have punished him for a retiring style that can sound contemptuous of the very campaign he is trying to win.If he wants to win the party\u2019s nomination, the political universe has told him, he needs to shove aside his young disciple, Marco Rubio \u2014 and do it fast.On stage in Boulder, Colo., Mr. Rubio had just nimbly sidestepped a tough question about his spotty voting record in the Senate, chiding the moderators and what he called the biased news media as the crowd applauded.Then Mr. Bush did something uncharacteristic: He interrupted, with the decorousness of a Bush.\u201cCould I bring something up here?\u201d he asked politely.He adopted the avuncular tone of a onetime mentor and neighbor who had advised and encouraged Mr. Rubio as the younger man rose from West Miami city commissioner to United States senator.\u201cBecause I am a constituent of the senator and I helped him,\u201d Mr. Bush continued.Then his tone turned scolding. \u201cI expected that he would do constituent service,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cWhich means that he shows up to work.\u201dWith that, the fissures in their decades-long bond, which have been opening behind the scenes for months, were suddenly there for all to see.And in their body language, the surprising story of the campaign seemed to unspool frame by frame, revealing the frustrations of Mr. Bush, awkwardly trying to adapt to modern sound-bite politics, and the talents of his young challenger, whose stage presence and confidence seem almost effortless.Mr. Bush was an unconvincing combatant. He appeared reluctant to look Mr. Rubio in the eye at first, delivering the opening lines of his attack to the audience, not the man standing right next to him.He began to wag his finger. \u201cBut Marco, when you signed up for this,\u201d Mr. Bush said, \u201cthis was a six-year term. And you should be showing up to work.\u201dFinally, Mr. Bush turned to Mr. Rubio, and, in a line that sounded rehearsed, tried to tie him to the Republicans\u2019 least favorite European economy.His face took on a look of disgust. \u201cI mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek? You get like three days where you have to show up?\u201dThe crowd broke into scattered laughs.But Mr. Rubio looked unbothered.Evincing patience, he seemed not only ready to endure the attack but confidently readying his own counterpunch.He did not nod. He did not look away. He calmly stared at Mr. Bush the entire time.When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Rubio expressed wonderment at Mr. Bush\u2019s sudden negativity, all but declaring that the Jeb Bush he knew could not possibly believe what he was saying.A campaign staff member must be behind it, he said.\u201cThe only reason you are doing it now,\u201d he said, \u201cis because we are running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\u201dMr. Bush appeared unsure of how to respond. He clasped his hands at one moment, and slipped his left hand into his suit pocket the next.He tried, but failed, to make his way back into the conversation.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, at Mr. Rubio\u2019s suggestion that aides had manipulated him into turning on him. \u201cI have been \u2014\u201dMr. Rubio plowed right past him.In a deft show of forcefulness and diplomacy, Mr. Rubio managed to seem both respectful of the older candidate and politically more imposing.\u201cMy campaign is going to be about the future of America. It\u2019s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.And then he all but smothered Mr. Bush with esteem.\u201cI will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not running against Governor Bush.\u201dMr. Rubio lifted his arms to his left and right. \u201cI am not running against anyone on this stage,\u201d he said.\u201dThe crowd offered a thunderous round of applause.The moderators moved on, and so did Mr. Bush, allowing Mr. Rubio to have the last word in the charged exchange. It echoed the exasperating pattern of the campaign for Mr. Bush, whose bulging war chest and formidable family network have added up to painfully little so far.Mr. Rubio, the upstart that the Bush inner circle never believed would enter the race, let alone overtake the man whose political blessing he once sought, had outmaneuvered Mr. Bush on live television, with millions watching. Fittingly, perhaps, the coda to the night\u2019s most memorable collision went to the only man who seems to irritate Mr. Bush more than Mr. Rubio these days: Donald J. Trump. Assessing the back-and-forth exchange as if a sports commentator, Mr. Trump loudly observed: \u201cThey do not like each other,\u201d he said, theatrically waving both hands in the air. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "International Students Find the American Dream ... in Flint", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosA few months after Abhishek Y. Utekar left Mumbai, India, to start an M.B.A. program at the University of Michigan campus in Flint, his landlord gave him a driving tour of his new home. Dennis Brownfield watched out for his tenants, and he wanted Mr. Utekar to understand the dynamics of a city often defined by deindustrialization and decay. His car provided the first lesson. It was a Honda Civic with a license plate that read \u201cGM LEFT,\u201d a commentary on the 70,000 automotive jobs that have disappeared over the years in this birthplace of General Motors.They rolled to a stop in the empty parking lot between the main library and Central High School, an imposing brick building shuttered because of falling enrollment and budget cuts. \u201cNow make sure you\u2019ve got your seatbelt on because I\u2019m going to show you an American custom,\u201d Mr. Brownfield said. He shifted into reverse, cranked the steering wheel hard to the right, gunned the engine and popped the clutch. The result was a dizzying, deftly executed series of backward 360s. For a final flourish, Mr. Brownfield yanked the emergency brake to abruptly change directions.\u201cThat\u2019s called a doughnut,\u201d he said when they had skidded to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s how we have fun in Michigan.\u201dRattled but impressed, Mr. Utekar realized: This was going to be a lot different than India.It is not, to state the obvious, a fun-loving college town like Ann Arbor. And yet, they come. This year, more than 700 international students, the largest number ever, are studying at U.M.-Flint, a commuter school of some 8,500 undergraduate and graduate students. Nearly 200 more attend Kettering, a smaller, more selective private university with a focus on automotive engineering. The numbers may seem comparatively modest, but this is a place people leave. These students \u2014 from Saudi Arabia, India, China, South Korea, Nigeria and more than 40 other countries \u2014 had hundreds of choices, and they chose Flint.The question, of course, is why.Some reasons are practical. Both universities offer degrees in fields popular with international students \u2014 engineering, business, computer science and health care. Tuition at U.M.-Flint is inexpensive compared to private universities, and the cost of living is low; a two-bedroom apartment near downtown rents for about $500 a month, utilities included. The universities actively recruit overseas and have forgiving admissions policies for foreign applicants (no SAT or ACT required). With international enrollment climbing nationwide for nearly a decade, to almost 886,000, it is perhaps inevitable that students find their way to cities like Flint.Conversations with some three dozen international students at U.M.-Flint and Kettering reveal another explanation. A coveted degree from the United States was their primary goal; where they attained it was far less important. Many found their way to Vehicle City by accident. Some had hopes of immigrating.Once here, they grumble about being homesick and about a strange meteorological term called wind chill factor. Joshua O. Anifowoshe, a Nigerian, would sometimes join in dorm-room griping with other international students who were disappointed in U.M.-Flint. Mr. Anifowoshe had wanted a smaller school, but after attending a boisterous football game in Ann Arbor with more than 100,000 fans, he started to waver, and transferred. \u201cIt was kind of lonely and boring in Flint,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized I needed a more rigorous academic environment and a more lively campus.\u201dBut the majority of international students stick it out \u2014 57 percent earn degrees in four years and 86 percent in five years, according to U.M.-Flint (impressive, considering that only 11 percent and 28 percent of all full-time freshmen there accomplish the same). In the process, the students said, they developed a deeper, more cleareyed understanding of the real America, and experienced an unanticipated sense of community.Mr. Utekar\u2019s story illustrates the leap of faith many international students take. He was working in sales for a Mumbai pharmaceutical company when he decided to try to immigrate to the United States. His sister had married an American and become a citizen while working for Wells Fargo on an H-1B visa after attending graduate school at Ithaca College. Mr. Utekar began researching M.B.A. programs.He considered the University of Michigan\u2019s highly ranked Ross School of Business in Ann Arbor but couldn\u2019t afford it. Back then, in 2010, Flint would cost him just $10,000 a year \u2014 $40,000 less than Ross. He checked a map and the two campuses were just an hour\u2019s drive apart. How different could they be?\u201cI did not look up anything about Flint, which was good because I wasn\u2019t judgmental and paranoid when I got here,\u201d he said. Besides, he had missed the application deadlines for his other choices.Residents seemed surprised and grateful when they learned someone had traveled such a great distance to study in Flint, Mr. Utekar said. He rented a room in a group house for $200 from Mr. Brownfield, and stood in line once a week for free groceries at a nearby church. He discovered McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s. A friend in India sent him incense sticks and ink drawings of Krishna on dried palm leaves that he sold at art fairs. A music student lent him a pair of Indian tabla drums, and he was soon playing with various bands in the area. He began dating an American woman.After completing his M.B.A. in 2013, Mr. Utekar had a job with a local software firm for a year on his F1 student visa. Students and recent graduates can work or intern for 12 to 29 months under the Optional Practical Training program in jobs related to their area of study. Roughly half of U.M.-Flint graduates take advantage of OPT, but how many succeed in permanently immigrating \u2014 there is still a 7 percent cap-per-country on green cards \u2014 is not known.Mr. Utekar\u2019s visa was still valid when his job ended, so he enrolled in the master\u2019s program in computer science, which he expects to complete next fall. Now 33, he does not want to leave the United States. He and his girlfriend recently bought a 1,344-square-foot house for $9,800 and have begun restoring it. \u201cMaybe I was just lucky, but I\u2019ve met amazing people in Flint,\u201d he said. \u201cI like it here.\u201dThat\u2019s what Flint officials like to hear. In the past decade, they have worked to make the city more appealing to students. A one-mile stretch that connects the University of Michigan campus and Kettering has been landscaped and rechristened University Avenue. The former Hyatt Regency Hotel downtown was converted into student housing. Last year, the popular farmers\u2019 market relocated to the edge of the U.M. campus, a fortresslike collection of interconnected brick buildings constructed in the \u201970s. A newer classroom building occupies the former site of the AutoWorld theme park, a short-lived attempt to lure tourists that was leveled in 1997. Abandoned buildings are still easy to spot. But a handful of new bars and restaurants have given students more to do, and Susan E. Borrego, chancellor of U.M.-Flint, has been talking to local leaders about sponsoring a cricket tournament.So it\u2019s no wonder that six U.M.-Flint staff members regularly travel the world to recruit students. Dan Adams, director of its international center, frequently finds himself in Dubai or Singapore fielding questions from a parent or two whose Google search turned up distressing news about Flint. \u201cI only have about 60 seconds of their attention to try and sell the school,\u201d he said, \u201cso I emphasize all the support services we offer, the small class sizes, and point out that downtown Flint is a safe area.\u201dKip Darcy, vice president for marketing, communications and enrollment at Kettering, takes a focused approach to recruiting engineering students. \u201cWe concentrate on India and China because they are a huge market for students hoping to study in the U.S., and they also have nascent automotive industries.\u201dKettering began working last fall in China with an independent broker, who assists students with the application process. U.M.-Flint contracts with approximately 20 brokers in various countries. In addition to collecting fees from students, the agents are paid $1,000 for each student they deliver who enrolls for at least two semesters. It\u2019s a practice the National Association for College Admissions Counseling permits in the recruitment of international students. But it does not endorse it, according to Eddie West, director of the association\u2019s international initiatives, and member schools cannot pay commissions for placement of domestic students.Brokers can have a huge influence, steering students toward specific schools, whether a good fit or not. Neelam Gire, a soft-spoken 24-year-old, desperately needed direction. She had hoped to attend medical school in India but froze when it came time to take the demanding entrance exam, which is given after high school.\u201cI was sitting in the car with my mom watching people go into the building to take the test,\u201d she remembered. \u201cI told her I just couldn\u2019t do it and we left. It was a big relief to drive away.\u201dHer mother encouraged her to study in the United States and, for $500, hired a broker to suggest schools, help her with applications and prep her for her visa interview. U.M.-Flint was the first to accept her. She had never heard of Michigan, let alone Flint, but she thought the other options \u2014 the State University of New York and Fairleigh Dickinson University \u2014 were too close to her former boyfriend, who attended a community college in New Jersey. What if she bumped into him?She checked into her dorm on a Sunday. She was struck by the emptiness of the campus, and downtown. \u201cI was shocked that there were no tall buildings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looked like a village. I had a brochure that showed people sitting on the grass and chatting, and I was wondering, \u2018Where are they?\u2019\u201dWhen a fellow student from India gave Ms. Gire a tour of Flint to help her acclimate, he presented an array of personal safety tips. Don\u2019t walk alone after dark. Stay alert so no one can sneak up on you. Never wear high heels because assailants can hear the click of your shoes on the pavement, and it\u2019s hard to run away.While Ms. Gire dealt with acute anxiety, her mother, a single parent, struggled to pay her college expenses. In tearful Skype conversations, her two younger sisters complained that the family was suffering financially because of her. \u201cThey thought I was in some beautiful place and enjoying life, but it was hard for me to even go outside because I thought it was unsafe,\u201d she said.Ms. Gire reluctantly moved off-campus into a studio apartment to save money, further isolating herself. She spent entire days playing video games and eating. She gained 10 pounds and dropped out for a semester, holed up in her apartment. Returning home would be shameful.Slowly, she got used to living away from her family. The university hired Ms. Gire as an \u201cinternational ambassador,\u201d bolstering her confidence and enabling her to make new friends. The eight ambassadors correspond with prospective applicants from other countries, welcome newcomers and plan events.Because it\u2019s the international students who live on or near campus, they have an outsize impact on life at U.M.-Flint. In fact, the 2014-15 student government president was from Mauritius, an island off the southeast coast of Africa.Ms. Gire got involved with the Indian Student Association and helped organize a celebration last fall to mark Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. At a school where almost half the students are part-time and 50 is considered a big turnout, more than 400, including a group of exchange students from Mexico and dozens of American students, squeezed into four rooms in the student center. There was food, a D.J. and dancing, both traditional and not so traditional. Fines were levied for overcrowding.\u201cNo one wanted to leave,\u201d Ms. Gire said. \u201cThey just wanted to keep dancing.\u201dMs. Gire now lives with her Canadian boyfriend in East Village, a 16-block neighborhood near downtown that is popular with international students. They want to stay in the United States. After graduating in June with a psychology degree, Ms. Gire got a job, under the OPT program, in the university\u2019s international admissions office. She intends on enrolling in a master\u2019s program in public administration in about a year, with the career goal of working in higher education with international students.\u201cI used to hate it here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it feels like home.\u201d\u2022One Friday night last semester, the International Club at Kettering met at Extreme Indoor Kart Racing in a lonely shopping center, where a handful of customers were playing arcade games or racing under fluorescent lights on a quarter-mile track outlined with old tires. There was a good turnout: 40 students representing Pakistan, India, China, Iran and Brazil along with a few Americans.Locksly Wallace, an effervescent Jamaican with a quick smile, doled out tickets and a few students put on their crash helmets, prompting a furious round of selfies. About a dozen men in the automotive systems program gathered at a viewing window, eagerly awaiting their turn and critiquing another group navigating the track. An animated discussion on cornering technique ensued.\u201cWe are really car freaks,\u201d one explained.The students stayed for three hours and enthusiastically ate pizza in the otherwise empty parking lot before car-pooling back to campus.Mr. Wallace reported that the night took $600 from the International Club budget and injected it directly into the local economy. Money well spent, in his opinion.Typical of Kettering students, Mr. Wallace took an intentional route to Flint. He had tested into a high school for students with academic potential and was selected to participate in an intensive five-week pre-college program at Kettering aimed at low-income students of color. Once again, he stood out, earning a scholarship to study chemical engineering.Mr. Wallace, whose mother worked as a maid and seamstress to support the family, grew up with seven siblings in Central Village, a rough area between Kingston and Spanish Town characterized by poverty and violence. He admitted that his expectations of life in the United States were formed largely by Hollywood, and like many international students he thought that all of America was prosperous. When he arrived, he discovered a city that had similarities with Central Village. \u201cIt turned out that Flint is pretty much what I\u2019m used to, so I can relate to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only shock was realizing that, \u2018Oh, this happens in America, too.\u2019\u2009\u201dStudents describe the Kettering campus, comprising just seven buildings near downtown, as an island isolated from the city\u2019s more crime-ridden neighborhoods. There\u2019s a police substation across the street from the university, and Kettering\u2019s website describes a \u201cstate-of-the art security and high definition closed-circuit television surveillance system\u201d installed in 2013.But Mr. Wallace didn\u2019t retreat from the rest of the city. He joined a mentoring program that connects Kettering students with academically promising high school students. He met regularly with three boys, prepping them for college, taking them to art museums, and offering them advice on girlfriends and other mysteries of adolescence.\u201cI had friends back home who dropped out of high school and ended up on the corner smoking weed,\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cSome of them were dead before they were 18. So I could empathize and offer good solutions for what they were going through.\u201dThe young men he befriended had a sense of hopelessness. \u201cThe common theme that I heard was: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get out of here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cFlint really has nothing to offer kids with potential. They\u2019re going to leave.\u201dMr. Wallace earned his master\u2019s in engineering management in June and works as a project manager at an automotive supplier. He hopes to land a job in the renewable energy field in California and, eventually, return to Jamaica.He is rooting for better times in Flint but he has no intention of staying. \u201cThe engineer in me loves problem solving,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve done my time.\u201dGordon Young, a native of Flint, Mich., is author of \u201cTeardown: Memoir of a Vanishing City\u201d and is a senior lecturer in communication at Santa Clara University.Advertisement"}

He has overhauled the management of the state oil company, while also moving to retrieve stolen money.In recent days, the campaign escalated with the arrest of two high-profile figures: Diezani Alison-Madueke, the former oil minister whose five-year tenure was marred by recurring accusations of widespread theft; and Olajide Omokore, the chairman of a Nigerian oil company. Both were held as part of inquiries into corruption and money laundering.\u201cThose actions will sustain the fear that the culture of impunity is over and government\u2019s will to prosecute is strong,\u201d said Adams Oshiomhole, a governor leading a national panel investigating federal graft. \u201cThere\u2019s no more free money flowing because of the attempts by the president to block it, but also the fear that, \u2018If I\u2019m caught now, I\u2019ll be prosecuted.\u2019\u201dBut this year, with national frustration boiling over corruption and the rampages of Boko Haram, the extremist group that has terrorized northern Nigeria, Mr. Buhari won the presidential election in March as the head of an opposition alliance that is tasting power for the first time. Now many politicians and businessmen say he is facing growing pressure to reward the faithful.The widening anti-corruption drive has chilled the economy elsewhere in the country, but nowhere has its impact been felt as keenly as here in the capital.At Coscharis, the leading dealer of luxury cars here, Happiness Adibe has been going through her worst year in her nine years as a saleswoman. Last year was her strongest: a record number of buyers, mostly businessmen and politicians, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars buying Range Rovers and Jaguars from her. Seventy percent of her customers paid cash.\u201cThere\u2019s no money now, no money,\u201d Ms. Adibe said. \u201cContracts aren\u2019t going on now, everything is standing still. When contracts are going on, people are getting contracts and doing their, you know, thing.\u201dAt Royal Choice \u2014 a gated community of villas selling for up to $1.8 million each, some furnished according to a London, New York, Dubai or Shanghai theme \u2014 Joshua Bialonwu has not scored a single sale since the new government took over. Under the previous administration, customers often bought villas in cash.On a tour through Royal Choice\u2019s eerily deserted streets and inside several villas, each empty except for a guard and a cellphone charging from a wall, Mr. Bialonwu explained why sales had dried up.\u201cWith the uncertainties of the government presently, nobody knows how much you might be asked to return,\u201d Mr. Bialonwu said. \u201cSo you want to hold on to as much as you can.\u201dNegotiations over what to do with ill-gotten gains are taking place quietly.Nasir El-Rufai, the governor of Kaduna state and a member of the panel investigating graft, said that associates of one former minister had approached him with an offer to return $250 million.\u201cWhen you say you want to refund, it means you are admitting that you took what was not yours,\u201d Mr. Rufai said. \u201cI said, \u2018I am a governor, I am not involved in this. I will pass on your message.\u2019 \u201dThe missing funds could amount to \u201c$10.8 billion or $12 billion or $19 billion or $21 billion \u2014 we do not know at this point,\u201d the bank governor wrote to the Nigerian Senate before his dismissal, adding that the problem could \u201cbring the entire economy to its knees.\u201dThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, the state oil company, spent half of what it collected on its own operations, Mr. Rufai said.\u201cThe corrupt try to take money under the table,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Jonathan\u2019s government, it is done so openly, with records. People actually document the diversion of funds. You just wonder, what is wrong with them.\u201dThe loss of oil revenues has left many of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states bankrupt or nearly bankrupt, unable to pay salaries.Corruption in other sectors of the government was equally self-destructive, said Mr. Oshiomhole, the federal graft panel leader.Money meant for the purchase of arms in the army\u2019s fight against Boko Haram vanished, leaving soldiers without proper equipment. The privatization of the state power utility was riddled with fraud, enriching individuals but leaving most Nigerians still without electricity.An import duty waiver granted to a politically connected Indian rice importer has dumped one million tons of substandard rice in Nigeria, Mr. Oshiomhole said, adding that a big farmer in his state, Edo, shelved plans to grow rice as a result.Here in Abuja, people with no particular expertise but solid political connections made fortunes.\u201cNothing better explains the amount of theft that went on that somebody without a business \u2014 he has a small office in the corner of his house with an iPad and a cellphone \u2014 has jets,\u201d Mr. Oshiomhole said. \u201cEverybody was just buying jets.\u201dThe cash fueled a boom in high-end real estate development in the capital, Abuja, and in Lagos, the nation\u2019s main city. Villas and condominiums built or purchased to launder money tellingly remain unoccupied, real estate agents and businessmen say.At Pated, a store that has sold Italian marble to the Abuja elite for decades, some politicians and high-ranking civil servants came to make large purchases in their official vehicles, said John Abimiku, a salesman. Others were more discreet, or tried to be.\u201cIf you are dealing with a private businessman, you see a lot of prudence in terms of managing their resources,\u201d Mr. Abimiku said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a politician, you tell him a price and he doesn\u2019t argue too much. \u2018O.K., it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s have it.\u2019\u201dBut Sadiq Yaqub, Pated\u2019s manager, said business now was the \u201cworst it\u2019s ever been\u201d in the 12 years he has worked at the store.To press ahead, the Buhari government will back a new law to prosecute cases of corruption more quickly, said Itse Sagay, a legal scholar and human rights activist who now leads another presidential panel against corruption.No high-profile case of corruption has been prosecuted successfully in the past decade, reinforcing a culture of impunity, Mr. Sagay said. Wealthy defendants have been able to exploit legal maneuvers to draw out trials for more than a decade.\u201cAfter 10, 12 years, you begin to have prosecution fatigue,\u201d he said. \u201cWitnesses have died, witnesses have disappeared. Those who have started the prosecution have retired.\u201dMr. Sagay said that his panel is also focusing on reforming the handful of government anti-corruption agencies, which, he said, have been \u201ccontaminated\u201d by officials working in concert with those they are supposed to be investigating.\u201cWe now have at the federal government level a government that actually appreciates the work of the anti-corruption agencies,\u201d said Sola Akinrinade, the head of a government anti-corruption academy.\u201cCorruption,\u201d Mr. Akinrinade said, \u201cwill fight back.\u201dAdam Nossiter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Unpredictable Canadian Elections, Plurality Is More Important Than Popularity", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Stephen Harper did not get to be prime minister of Canada by persuading most of the country\u2019s voters to put him in office, and that is not how he intends to keep the job in the general elections on Monday.Thanks to a splintered opposition, Mr. Harper and his Conservative Party have prevailed in three straight elections and held power for nine years without ever winning more than 40 percent of the vote.With that first tactical strike, Mr. Harper opened Canada\u2019s longest official federal campaign season in at least a century, an absorbing and at times strikingly vitriolic spectacle of political calculation. In broad strokes, Mr. Harper said his re-election would bring \u201cstability, not risk.\u201d The main opposition groups, the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, say they will restore Canadian traditions of progressive liberalism and roll back what they see as the Harper era\u2019s bellicose posture in foreign affairs.Retail-level politics is now conducted in a dozen or so languages, as candidates try to reach voters at festivals and supermarkets, in community centers and on doorsteps. Nearly half of all residents in the Toronto suburbs were born outside Canada, in China, South Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East.Some ridings, or parliamentary districts, were decided by fewer than 1,000 votes in the last elections. This time, it is not just party machines that are trying to grab those seats. A swath of nonaligned voters, known as A.B.C.s, Anything But Conservative, have organized online to pool and swap votes.For instance, Olivier Jarvis Lavoie, a 32-year old researcher who lives in a Toronto riding unlikely to vote Conservative, struck a deal with a friend, a Green Party supporter who lives in an Ottawa district where a Conservative candidate is competitive.\u201cHe said, \u2018If you\u2019re willing to vote Green in your riding, I will vote for whichever candidate is best positioned to defeat the Conservative,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Lavoie said.\u201cIt\u2019s a Rubik\u2019s Cube here in Canada: a three-dimensional electoral map with history, immigration and vote switching,\u201d said John Wright, a senior vice president with Ipsos Reid, a polling and marketing company.Since August, each of the three big parties has led in one poll or another, but the robust, dizzying political culture puts the race well beyond the reach of trustworthy handicapping. At least six parties have fielded nearly 1,800 candidates for seats in all or some of the 338 ridings, spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and north to the Arctic. In each riding, a simple plurality determines the winner. Any party with a majority in Parliament \u2014 170 or more members \u2014 selects the prime minister and forms the government.\u201cEven with six in 10 people hating them, the Conservatives could still win with a massive parliamentary majority at 38 percent of the popular vote, or a comfortable majority at 37 percent,\u201d Mr. Wright said.The same arithmetic might also work for the New Democrats, led by Thomas Mulcair, or the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, whose father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was prime minister for 15 years into the early 1980s.In their fight to be recognized as the standard bearers of change, Mr. Mulcair, 60, and Mr. Trudeau, 43, have been hostile to each other but both have said that they would try to block Mr. Harper from forming government if the Conservatives or their own parties do not get a majority.Mr. Trudeau took over the Liberals in 2013 when the party was in shambles after a historic rout two years earlier. By all accounts, it has been restored to a position as a serious political force. Recent polls show it in the lead.The youngest of the main candidates, Mr. Trudeau has led a campaign of high style and tight scripts, inviting photographers to see him sparring in a boxing ring, paddling a canoe, or picking pumpkins with his wife and their three young children. He recently outlined a child welfare program in Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium, saying that the arena\u2019s seats could hold the 60,000 children who would be lifted out of poverty under the Liberal proposal. As a video drone operated by one of his aides buzzed overhead in the nearly empty stadium, he waved, smiled and boarded a bus.His opponents have tried to use his age, relative inexperience, and youthful appearance against him. One early Conservative ad ran through a list of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s supposed shortcomings, and concluded with the line, \u201cNice hair though.\u201d Another favored punch line: \u201cJust not ready.\u201dMr. Mulcair was a bit more subtle, addressing Mr. Trudeau in debates as \u201cJustin.\u201dThe condescension may have backfired: Mr. Trudeau proved to be as forceful a presence as his opponents in debates that also included Elizabeth May of the Green Party, and Gilles Duceppe of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.For his part, Mr. Mulcair, the leader of what has traditionally been Canada\u2019s most left-leaning major party, came into the campaign as the front-runner. The party had surprised even itself by sweeping seats in Quebec in 2011.That support was shaken when the Harper government pursued a ban on the niqab, a face veil worn by some Muslim women, during citizenship ceremonies. Many in the French-speaking region were in favor of the ban but Mr. Mulcair opposed it, saying that while he was not comfortable with the niqab, the courts had ruled against prohibiting it. The Conservatives, Mr. Mulcair charged, were using it as a \u201cweapon of mass distraction.\u201d Mr. Harper said the ban \u201creflects our values as a society.\u201d So far, polls suggest, the niqab debate may have undermined the New Democrats in Quebec, and coincided with their loss of ground elsewhere.\u201cHarper was a genius in a way, Machiavellian,\u201d said Christian Dufour, a political scientist at \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Administration Publique in Montreal. \u201cIt was a big, big trap. Mulcair was unable to say \u2018It\u2019s common sense, when you swear, don\u2019t wear it.\u2019 He was out of sync with 93 percent of French-speaking Quebecers.\u201dThe niqab issue appears to have had marginal effect beyond Quebec. In the Ontario riding of East Brampton, a New Democratic candidate, Harbaljit Singh Kahlon, 33, knocks on doors every evening.\u201cIt\u2019s hard finding work,\u201d said Maryam Lazar, 25, who trained as a chemical technician, told him. She emigrated from Iraq five years ago and became a Canadian citizen in January.Ms. Lazar was one of about 25 people Mr. Kahlon met on a canvass last month with a reporter tagging along. Only one person mentioned the niqab. The others \u2014 Somalis, Punjabis, Bengalis, Tamils, Trinidadians, all recent Canadian citizens \u2014 spoke about immigration for relatives, jobs, traffic, car insurance rates, and a new sex education curriculum.Kevin Page served from 2008 to 2013 as Canada\u2019s first parliamentary budget officer and is now a professor at the University of Ottawa. \u201cWe have a federal party in power for almost 10 years, so it\u2019s natural for opposition to talk about time for change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also struggled this year economically.\u201dMr. Harper has counted his economic stewardship of Canada through the global recession in 2008 as a major achievement. This year, though, depressed oil prices have hurt the western provinces, Mr. Page said, and manufacturing and exports have declined.Mr. Trudeau has proposed deficit spending to stimulate the economy, arguing that low-interest rates make it prudent. Traditionally a more centrist party, the Liberals have outflanked Mr. Mulcair on the left; the New Democrats say they will balance the budget, paying for new programs with new taxes. Now that the Liberals are being taken more seriously, Mr. Harper has used a cash register sound effect when speaking of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s fiscal plans.One evening last month, Mr. Harper, 56, was led into a crowded Chinese festival in the Richmond Hill suburb of Toronto by a parade of young dancers, swaying dragons and bobbing tigers.Under his leadership, Mr. Harper told his cheering audience, Canada would remain \u201cthe most admired, the best country in the world.\u201dStanding in the back, James Young, 52, an immigrant from Beijing, said he and many Chinese had once backed the Liberals. He belted out the Canadian anthem to greet Mr. Harper.A few days later, Mr. Trudeau drew 5,000 people to a junior hockey arena about 25 miles away.\u201cOntario will decide who will form the government,\u201d said Pablo Rodriguez, a Liberal candidate on the east end of Montreal. \u201cQuebec will decide if it\u2019s a majority.\u201dAs shoppers emerged from a supermarket, Mr. Rodriguez, 48, sized up each one\u2019s background. His aim was unerring.\u201cBonsoir!\u201d\u201cBuon giorno!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201dAn older man called to him in Spanish, and said he was from Peru.\u201cDe Argentina,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez answered.\u201cAh,\u201d the shopper replied. \u201cContigo.\u201d With you.An article on Saturday about the unpredictability of federal elections in Canada, where voters headed to the polls on Monday, misspelled a middle name of a former Canadian prime minister. He was Pierre Elliott Trudeau, not Elliot. And because of an editing error, an accompanying picture caption misspelled, in some copies, the given name of the current prime minister. As the article correctly noted, he is Stephen Harper, not Steven.Advertisement"}

Lawmakers in other countries will also decide whether to ratify the agreement.The pact could set trading rules for a large part of the world, accounting for 40 percent of the world economy. Done right, an agreement tying these countries together should bolster everyone\u2019s economy and help raise labor, environment and other standards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Irwin Schiff, Fervent Opponent of Federal Income Taxes, Dies at 87 ", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIrwin A. Schiff, who built a national following by arguing that income taxes are unconstitutional and spent more than 10 years in prison for evading them and for helping thousands of others to do the same, died on Friday at a hospital affiliated with a federal prison in Fort Worth. He was 87.The cause was lung cancer, his son Andrew said on Monday.At his death, Mr. Schiff was an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution, where he was serving his third prison term, a 14-year sentence handed down in 2005.Mr. Schiff sold more than 250,000 copies of six self-published books, including \u201cHow Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Taxes\u201d (1980), \u201cThe Great Income Tax Hoax\u201d (1985) and \u201cThe Federal Mafia: How the Federal Government Illegally Imposes and Unlawfully Collects Federal Income Taxes\u201d (1992).His writings became widely cited in the literature of the so-called tax-honesty movement (tax deniers, to opponents) and of right-wing organizations challenging the legitimacy of the federal government.Over the years, Mr. Schiff pressed his cause on national television shows like \u201cLarry King Live\u201d and \u201cThe Tomorrow Show\u201d with Tom Snyder. And when he wasn\u2019t barnstorming the country conducting seminars and selling videotapes, he worked out of a storefront office in Las Vegas. There, behind a large sign that read, \u201cWhy Pay Income Taxes? When No Law Says You Have To?,\u201d he offered counseling, for fees.His bottom-line advice: Declare \u201czero income.\u201d\u201cYou, sir, would be the lawbreaker, not I,\u201d Mr. Schiff told a federal judge in 1980, if he were sentenced for not paying taxes that \u201care obviously not authorized by the Constitution.\u201d The judge, T. Emmet Clarie, sentenced Mr. Schiff to six months in prison and a fine of $10,000 for deliberately not filing tax returns for 1974 and 1975.It was his first prison term. His most recent was for personally evading taxes as well as advising more than 3,600 others to follow his example by withholding about $56 million in revenue from the federal government. (One year of the 14-year sentence was for contempt of court.)In that case a Las Vegas jury convicted him of multiple charges, including conspiracy, tax evasion and tax fraud. He also served three years of a six-year term he received in 1985.In essence, Mr. Schiff argued that the Constitution had established that the value of the dollar was based on a certain amount of gold or silver, and that after the so-called gold standard was phased out, starting during the Depression, citizens no longer earned dollars, or income.His second basic argument was that since all information in a tax return can be used against the taxpayer in a criminal proceeding, filling out a return \u2014 he called it a \u201ctax confession\u201d \u2014 violated the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.Congress instituted the income tax in 1861 to pay for the Union cause in the Civil War. Widespread resistance led to its repeal in 1872.After the income tax was reinstituted in 1894, Charles Pollock, a Massachusetts man, sued a loan company in which he held shares to stop it from paying the tax on the ground that it was unconstitutional. He cited the \u201ccapitation clause\u201d in Article I, which provides that Congress can impose taxes directly only if they are apportioned according to the population of each state. The Supreme Court ruled in Mr. Pollock\u2019s favor, striking down the 1894 law.Soon after, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle began calling for a constitutional amendment to overrule the Pollock decision. In 1913, the 16th Amendment \u2014 which grants Congress the power to collect income taxes \u201cwithout apportionment among the several States\u201d \u2014 was ratified. Since then, no legal argument against the income tax has been upheld.Still, when he was indicted in 2004 for the third time, Mr. Schiff declared, \u201cI have filed my tax returns and reported zero income because I have no income in the constitutional sense.\u201d\u201cI say I am America\u2019s leading expert on the income tax,\u201d he continued. \u201cEveryone knows I believe no law requires me to pay taxes, so there is no willful intent to commit a crime. And if I am wrong, then I am delusional, in which case I am not willful. So they can\u2019t legally convict me of tax evasion or any other crime that requires willful intent.\u201dTo Robert L. Schulz, chairman of the We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education, which scrutinizes the constitutionality of government activity, Mr. Schiff was something of a hero.\u201cHe acted on his beliefs and stood for tax honesty,\u201d Mr. Schulz said in an interview for this obituary in 2012. \u201cIn a society where there is so much fear of government, and in particular of the I.R.S., he was probably the most influential educator regarding the illegal and unconstitutional operation and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to speak to power, but he did,\u201d Mr. Schulz added, \u201cand he paid a very heavy price.\u201d\u201cA lot of desperate people latched onto Schiff\u2019s schemes as a quick solution to their problems, and their lives were effectively destroyed,\u201d Ms. MacNab said in an interview in 2012. \u201cWhen most tax-protest leaders go to prison, it\u2019s like they vanish, but he was such a charismatic figure in the movement that rather than being forgotten he was turned into a martyr.\u201dIrwin Allen Schiff was born in New Haven on Feb. 23, 1928, the youngest of eight children of Jacob and Anna Schiff. His father, who had emigrated from what is now Poland in the 1890s, was a carpenter. \u201cIt was a solidly blue-collar, F.D.R. family,\u201d Andrew Schiff said.But Mr. Schiff\u2019s views began shifting at the University of Connecticut, where he immersed himself in the thinking of stalwarts of the Austrian school of economics, like Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich A. Hayek and Henry Hazlitt, who essentially argued that government intervention in the economy is at best ineffective.After graduating with a degree in economics in 1950, Mr. Schiff served in the Army for two years, then became an insurance broker. By the mid-1960s he was administering investments, primarily for doctors.But his tax-shelter corporation, as well as his personal fortune, suffered in 1968 when a friend selling shares in a gold mine \u201cturned out to be a con man running a Ponzi scheme,\u201d Andrew Schiff said. \u201cHe and his clients lost a lot of money.\u201dMr. Schiff, who was not implicated in the scheme, turned to writing. His first book, \u201cThe Biggest Con: How the Government Is Fleecing You,\u201d was published in 1972.His marriage to Ellen Wachsman ended in divorce. Besides his son, he is survived by his girlfriend, Cynthia Neun, who also served time in prison for tax evasion; another son, Peter; and four grandchildren.Peter Schiff, the president of Euro Pacific Capital, a brokerage firm, achieved renown as an author of the recession-related books \u201cCrash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse\u201d (2006) and \u201cThe Real Crash: America\u2019s Coming Bankruptcy\u201d (2012).By 1980, he had been urging his father \u201cto cease what he saw as futile resistance,\u201d the monthly journal The American Conservative reported in October 2009.\u201cHe admits today that he finds Irwin\u2019s intellectual case compelling,\u201d the journal added, \u201cbut is completely disinclined to imitate his father\u2019s radical methods or his idealism.\u201dIt quoted him as saying: \u201cThe problem with my father is that he\u2019s not practical. He was always going to lose.\u201dDaniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrants Taking Arctic Path to Norway Are Stranded in Russia", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 More than 500 refugees from Syria and other countries have been left stranded recently in the tiny town of Nikel on Russia\u2019s far northern edge, where they have encountered problems trying to cross into Norway, the local news media reported.Most of the migrants had tried to enter Europe by flying to Moscow on tourist or other visas. They then traveled above the Arctic Circle, where Russia has a border with Norway. The lure of this unlikely route is that it bypasses unfriendly border guards, barbed-wire fences and cluttered refugee camps that migrants bound for Germany and Scandinavia often encounter in Central Europe.The migrants who make their way through Russia travel to the regional capital, Murmansk, and then to the border at Nikel, an industrial town of just under 13,000 people. There, they usually take a taxi to the border and then cover the short distance between the Russian and Norwegian border posts on bicycles \u2014 crossing on foot is not allowed.Norway, while not a member of the European Union, is part of the Schengen Area, which gives people who enter unfettered access to most other European countries.About 1,200 refugees seeking asylum have made this journey in 2015, compared with just a dozen in 2014, Norway\u2019s government said in a report this month, according to Reuters.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.As this alternative route gained attention in the news media, Nikel\u2019s only hotel began to overflow with migrants waiting for processing. Local stores ran out of bicycles.On Wednesday, around 100 migrants sent a letter to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, demanding free passage to Norway with or without a bicycle. Several people tried to cross the border on foot but were stopped by Russian officers.\u201cWe have no space to shelter them, but we cannot leave them on the streets, either,\u201d Alexander Morozov, head of the municipality, told the local state-run television station, Murman.The weather has posed a challenge, with temperatures on Friday hovering around freezing. The authorities parked an ambulance in front of the hotel to provide timely help if it was needed. Many of the migrants stuck in Nikel are women and children.In Norway, the situation has set off a debate about whether the border crossing should be closed. Some politicians have said the flow of migrants should be blocked, while other officials said they were concerned that shutting the border could damage the local economy. Norway has also raised concerns that some Syrians who have been in Russia for a while are trying to take advantage of the current crisis to gain refugee status in Europe.In Russia, regional courts have begun to order the deportation of foreigners who try to cross the border by pretending they are Syrians. The first three Afghan nationals will be deported next week, a local news website reported.Russian and Norwegian diplomats are expected to discuss the situation soon, news reports said.\u201cThis is a challenge both for us and for Russia, but together we must overcome it,\u201d Ole Andreas Lindeman, the Norwegian consul general in Murmansk, said on the local television report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Lowers Price of Tourist Visas for Chinese to Aid Luxury Sector", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain plans to make it easier for Chinese tourists to acquire visas, the government said on Wednesday during a state visit by President Xi Jinping of China, in a move welcomed by the luxury goods and hospitality industries.Prime Minister David Cameron announced the changes, which he said were designed to \u201cmaximize Chinese spending power\u2033 by cutting the cost of a two-year multiple-entry visa to 84 pounds, or $130, from \u00a3384, or $594.The change is set to take effect in January in a bid to increase visits to Britain by wealthy Chinese looking to spend abroad.\u201cChina is becoming one of our fastest-growing tourism markets, so making it easier and more convenient for Chinese visitors to come to the U.K. is extremely important,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. While there was a decline in visits by Chinese tourists to Britain last year, Mr. Cameron said such visitors contribute \u00a3500 million a year to the British economy, with each visitor spending an average of \u00a32,700.The government has come under sustained pressure from some of the biggest names in British hospitality and luxury retailing to relax the application process for Chinese tourists, asserting that the cost and complexities involved had driven the big spenders elsewhere.Chinese tourists are required to have a Schengen visa to visit 26 mainland countries in Europe and must hold a separate visa to enter Britain.Michael Ward, the managing director of the upmarket department store Harrods, said in an interview last month that a slowdown of Chinese shoppers \u2014 many of whom travel abroad to buy brand-name luxury goods \u2014 was tied to the hassle of getting into Britain.\u201cMany just head over to Paris instead to make their purchases,\u201d he said.Still, the announcement on Wednesday was welcomed as a positive first step by many in the luxury sector as China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, was holding its own against the pound.\u201cThe Chinese really admire the quality, creativity and craftsmanship of British luxury goods, and today\u2019s announcement makes it easier for them to visit and shop here,\u201d said Michelle Emerson, chief executive of Walpole, a trade group representing 170 luxury brands in Britain.Chinese consumers make up more than 30 percent of global luxury sales, according to the management consulting firm Bain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "WeWork Ends Combative Dispute With Former Janitorial Workers", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, WeWork, which offers temporary office space with perks like arcade games, showers and coffee bars to entrepreneurs and big businesses alike, said it would now use unionized contractors to provide janitorial services for its locations in New York and Boston.The agreement comes after months of protests from former WeWork cleaners, who were paid as little as $10 an hour through a nonunion contractor, Commercial Building Maintenance.In the weeks ahead, WeWork will put out a request for proposals from unionized cleaning contractors in New York and Boston. As part of its request, it will ask that former C.B.M. workers be hired. For former Commercial Building cleaners that WeWork does not hire directly, the company has set aside $250,000 for severance payments, which will be allocated based on years of service.The settlement is an abrupt turn for WeWork, which was facing criticism from its members \u2014 the individuals and businesses who rent space \u2014 many of whom sympathized with the laid-off janitors.\u201cThis was a case of two organizations that really didn\u2019t know each other,\u201d said Arthur Minson, WeWork\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cOnce we were able to sit down with the union, in a matter of a few weeks\u2019 time we moved from foes to friends.\u201dC.B.M. asked WeWork to renegotiate its contract to allow the workers to join a union, but WeWork declined, leading to the layoffs of about 100 cleaners. Instead, WeWork said it would directly employ janitors, or so-called community service associates, but would not commit to hiring all the former Commercial Building cleaners.Last month, tensions came to a boil, as WeWork\u2019s chief executive and one of its founders, Adam Neumann, confronted protesters outside company headquarters. But until Tuesday, WeWork had not changed its position.Labor experts praised the deal.\u201cThis is a model agreement,\u201d said Jennifer Gordon, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law who specializes in immigration and employment. \u201cCleaners stood up for their rights, and WeWork listened. The outcome here demonstrates that a firm can and should take responsibility for the treatment of workers whose labor benefits its business, whether it hires them directly or through a contractor.\u201dAs part of the agreement, S.E.I.U. will no longer pursue a charge it filed with the National Labor Relations Board accusing WeWork of discriminating against pro-union job applicants.\u201cThis in many ways is an unprecedented agreement,\u201d said Hector Figueroa, president of the local S.E.I.U. chapter. \u201cWe hope that this helps more good jobs get associated with the sharing economy. Services workers that are part of these operations need to have a place in the new economy.\u201dFormer Commercial Building workers, many of whom were vocal in their frustration with WeWork, cheered the news as well.\u201cIt is very exciting for me and my former co-workers to see that WeWork is committing to good cleaning jobs and that I will have a chance to return to work there,\u201d said Ivan Castelan, one of the former Commercial Building cleaners. \u201cIt feels really good to see that when working people stand together, we can change our lives and the lives of other workers for the better.\u201dMr. Minson said the community service associates that WeWork had already hired would be kept on staff. \u201cAs a fast-growing company, we have a robust need for talented people,\u201d he said.He added that while WeWork had not decided how it would handle cleaning arrangements in other cities, he believed that the resolution of this ordeal would win the company good will.\u201cHopefully, people have learned that we are great partners to work with,\u201d Mr. Minson said. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly reasonable and practical.

{"Headline": "All You Can Fly, for a Monthly Subscription", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesBen Lamm, chief executive of Chaotic Moon Studios, a software design company, wanted a shorter commute between the company\u2019s headquarters in Austin, Tex., and its new office in Dallas.\u201cI never had a good day,\u201d he said of driving the roughly 200 miles that could take five hours with traffic and construction.Commercial flights had drawbacks with time to park and clear security. And on-time flights aren\u2019t a certainty.Last summer, he started flying with a new service called Rise. It offers subscription memberships for $1,650 to $2,650 a month for unlimited scheduled travel among four Texas cities \u2014 Austin, Dallas, Houston and Midland.Rise does not, however, own a single plane. The flights are on eight-seat Beechcraft Air King 350 planes that Rise leases from charter companies. The planes have a Rise logo and depart from private aviation terminals. The company said passengers can arrive within minutes of departure. It provides free parking, Wi-Fi, snacks and the services of a concierge for help with connections.The traditional airline is going virtual.\u201cThis is the sharing economy with planes,\u201d said Nick Kennedy, the chief executive of Rise. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell seats on planes; we sell time to members.\u201dAs commercial flights become more cramped and delays increase, member-only air services are drawing the attention of wealthier business travelers.The membership model began in 2013 with the creation of Surf Air, an airline based in Santa Monica, Calif. It flies to California cities and has 2,100 members \u2014 up from 300 when it began. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown solely on referrals,\u201d said Jeff Potter, the chief.Unlike Rise, it owns or leases to buy a dozen Pilatus PC-12s, up from three planes two years ago. Memberships start at $1,750 a month for unlimited travel with a $1,000 initiation fee.Companies like Rise, along with Beacon, another new subscription service, have taken what they see as the next step in membership air service.\u201cWe\u2019re a sales-and-service company,\u201d said Wade Eyerly, chief executive and co-founder of Beacon, which flies between Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., and Logan International Airport in Boston. He has seen the evolution firsthand, as Surf Air\u2019s co-founder and first chief executive. Beacon offers unlimited flights for $2,250 a month.\u201cThey don\u2019t own airplanes, they don\u2019t have pilots, they don\u2019t perform maintenance and they don\u2019t have an airline operating certificate,\u201d said Robert Mann, an industry analyst and consultant. And that distinction, he said, makes these new entities marketing platforms \u2014 not carriers.Instead, the member-only clubs have contracts with aviation companies to provide flight operations. One Rise operator is Menagerie Enterprises, doing business as Monarch Air, a charter company based in Addison, Tex. Another is Gulf Coast Aviation, which offers aircraft management services, which is based in Houston. Beacon has a contract with Dynamic Aviation in Bridgewater, Va., a supplier of commercial planes, to maintain and operate a fleet of Beechcraft King Air 200 planes configured with six seats.To plan timetables, the start-ups are relying on an interpretation of a Federal Aviation Administration regulation that allows a commuter authorization for scheduled operations of five or more round trips in a week.For passengers, the focus is on saving time and money, not logistics. Paul Krasinski, a senior vice president for business development and strategy at SessionM, a Boston-based mobile loyalty program, travels to New York two to three times a month.Previously he flew on the US Airways Shuttle, booking a day or two before, buying tickets that ran $450 to $475 one-way for the 90-minute flight. A taxi from La Guardia Airport generally added 45 minutes to the trip.Now, with Beacon, he said, he saves an hour on each leg because he can arrive 15 minutes before departure, whereas Logan airport in Boston recommends two hours for commercial flights. He says he breaks even if he flies three round trips a month. And, he is home in the evenings to read to his two young sons.While the all-you-can-fly model is expanding, at least one expert doubts its long-term prospects.\u201cI\u2019m rather skeptical that this is a sustainable business model in its current form,\u201d said Edward Clayton, a senior director with the consulting firm Strategy& (formerly Booz & Company), wrote by email. It would work well for passengers during the start-up phase, but as soon as a lot of people have signed up, they are going to run into problems with capacity at peak times,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.The services are part of a battle that has erupted for the high-dollar frequent flier, analysts say. Some specialists predict it is only a matter of time before competition intrudes. \u201cThe major carriers can begin to market against it,\u201d said Clayton R. Critcher, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.And some have questions about safety and security. Mr. Mann, for one, is skeptical. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are going to get,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have much opportunity to do due diligence.\u201dClub executives say the planes are subject to Federal Aviation Administration regulations, cite the safety records of the aircraft they use and say that they make every effort to minimize risk. Rise and Beacon planes fly with two pilots in the cockpit, although that is not required based on the size of the planes.The aircraft operators used by Rise are evaluated and rated by Argus International, a Cincinnati company that provides information to the aviation industry. Monarch Air, for example, holds the company\u2019s gold rating, Gulf Coast Aviation has a platinum one. Dynamic Aviation does not hold an Argus rating although the company doesn\u2019t know whether it has ever sought one. About 510 Argus-rated operators worldwide pay $7,500 to $15,000 to complete the initial audit process, with additional fees for renewal.Mr. Kennedy said Rise had a multilayered security process that meets all federal regulations. The company performs background checks on passengers, although it is not required to do so because small planes of 12 seats or less are not considered commercial carriers and are not regulated by the Transportation Safety Administration. \u201cOur pilots are trained and empowered to search passengers and luggage at any time,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.Beacon also conducts background checks. \u201cIt\u2019s very much the same security protocol as if you owned the plane,\u201d Mr. Eyerly said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to mirror that experience.\u201d Passengers on private flights are not permitted to connect to regular commercial flights without clearing T.S.A. security.Mr. Lamm, the chief of Chaotic Moon Studios, said he was satisfied with his Rise membership. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been late,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd dependability is just as important as time saving.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Chief Defends Investments in Labor, Stores and the Web", "Date": "2015-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is the consummate Walmart company man.\u201cThe reaction by the market \u2014 while not what we\u2019d hoped \u2014 was not entirely surprising,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese investments are critical to our current and future success as a company. Simply put, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dThe problems encountered by Walmart did not appear overnight, nor will a solution. The company that once redefined the retail landscape with its cavernous warehouselike stores that sold thousands of items at a discount \u2014 pushing small mom-and-pop stores across the country out of business \u2014 now finds itself facing formidable rivals in the digital-shopping arena.Moreover, its costs are climbing sharply higher at a time when sales are flat. Its stock is down 30 percent so far this year. This month, it laid off nearly 500 employees from its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.With more than $485 billion in annual revenue (just a bit behind the entire economy of Norway), 5,000 stores and clubs scattered around the world and 1.4 million \u201cassociates\u201d (employees), Walmart is still the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable retailer by far. But its size also makes changing course akin to turning around an ocean liner in a swimming pool.Among some of the needle-moving maneuvers being hotly debated among Wall Street analysts is whether the company should spin off its lower-margin Sam\u2019s Club unit, exit challenging overseas markets or buy an e-commerce player.Those decisions and many more are in the hands of Mr. McMillon, a 49-year-old whose family moved to Bentonville when he was a teenager.While Mr. McMillon was handpicked by the Walton family and is steeped in the Southern conservative stances, traditions and history of the company, his appointment, nonetheless, has represented a generational, cultural and societal shift within the retailer.In the last year, Walmart has stopped selling Confederate-flag merchandise as well as assault rifles, has publicly supported gay rights and, after years of criticism, has raised its minimum starting wage to $9 an hour.Now, progressives may be cheering, but Wall Street is not. Investors fear that Walmart\u2019s heavy investments in labor, in the Internet and in discounts will weigh on the retailer\u2019s short-term earnings \u2014 and many are running the other way.\u201cWalmart expects a return from these wagers,\u201d Michael Lasser, a retail analyst at UBS, wrote in a note. Still, \u201cit\u2019s unclear if its investment of $1.5 billion in labor and \u2018several billion dollars\u2019 in pricing will push it ahead of others, or just keep pace.\u201dWalmart would have an easier time if it were not under siege from multiple directions.Membership-only warehouse clubs like Costco and hard discounters like Aldi are eating away at Walmart\u2019s price-competitive edge. Hectic lifestyles are driving shoppers to smaller and more convenient dollar stores \u2014 even pharmacies \u2014 for groceries. Amazon and its vast online catalog, and the advent of seemingly every product imaginable at shoppers\u2019 fingertips, is neutralizing the advantage of Walmart\u2019s supercenter-size assortment.But despite declaring a decade and a half ago, in 1999, that it was determined to take on the web, Walmart has stumbled in its attempts to dominate online as it had brick-and-mortar. In the company\u2019s critical early days online, its insular culture helped drive away a celebrated e-commerce guru. It has been slow to roll out an online grocery store.Last year, Amazon sold almost $90 billion worth of products online, compared with just $12.2 billion Walmart sold through its website. E-commerce still makes up only about 2.5 percent of Walmart\u2019s annual sales, and its growth online is slowing. Its peers, however, have hardly done better; Target, for example, gets about 2.8 percent of its sales through its website.Walmart has promised to marry its fledgling web operations with its brick-and-mortar footprint of more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club locations in the United States, allowing customers all manner of options: online ordering, in-store pickup, curbside pickup and home delivery.But the retailer\u2019s transition to a multichannel operator \u201cis costing more and lasting longer than expected,\u201d said Simeon Gutman, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cNot sure it\u2019s the last time we\u2019ll be saying this.\u201dBut for some, it is not surprising that Walmart faces an uncertain future as the middle class is struggling. Though the job market is picking up, wages and income have grown slowly, especially for the typical Walmart shopper with an annual household income of just over $53,000, according to a survey conducted last year by Kantar Retail, a consulting firm based in London. Kantar found that Target\u2019s shoppers tended to make about $12,000 more annually.Paradoxically, labor groups say that Walmart, as the nation\u2019s largest private employer, shares the blame for America\u2019s ailing middle class. And they say that while it is a step forward for Walmart to increase the pay of its most poorly paid workers, the raise \u2014 to at least $9 this year and $10 next year \u2014 is not nearly enough.For the company to attribute its recent woes to higher wages for its workers is gratuitous, said Jess Levin, a spokeswoman for Making Change at Walmart, a campaign to improve working conditions at Walmart backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers union.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to blame a large profit drop on a $1 billion wage increase,\u201d Ms. Levin said. \u201cIf you look at what $1 billion means to Walmart, it\u2019s a very small fraction of their annual U.S. sales. If they had moved the needle at all on sales, this is a conversation we wouldn\u2019t be having in the first place.\u201dAfter falling short of a number of performance goals, Mr. McMillon saw his own compensation shrink 24 percent to $19.4 million last year.Mr. McMillon and his wife, Shelley, live in a house that sits on nearly 100 acres in north Bentonville, according to county assessor records. The gap between Walmart executives\u2019 lavish pay and lifestyles and the pay barely above minimum wage of Walmart employees has become a sore point in recent years.Speaking to investors last week, Mr. McMillon appeared to acknowledge that Walmart could no longer stick with business as usual.\u201cWe know what we did in the past wouldn\u2019t by itself be enough to win with customers,\u201d he said. \u201cRetail history is very clear. Those that are unwilling or unable to change go away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Geoffrey Howe, Cabinet Minister Who Hastened Thatcher\u2019s Fall, Dies at 88", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeoffrey Howe, a Conservative British cabinet minister who advanced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tough economic and foreign policies in the 1980s, but who resigned and hastened her downfall with a stinging attack on her government in its final days, died on Friday at his home in Warwickshire, England. He was 88.The cause appeared to be a heart attack, his family said in announcing his death.Prime Minister David Cameron, like Mr. Howe a Conservative, described him in a statement as someone \u201cwho loved his politics and never stopped giving strong and sound advice.\u201d Mr. Cameron also called Mr. Howe \u201cthe quiet hero of the first Thatcher government.\u201dBut Mr. Howe was also remembered for his dramatic dissent in the House of Commons in 1990 on what was then a burning issue: How much sovereignty should Britain surrender to join Europe\u2019s burgeoning economic, monetary and political union? Mrs. Thatcher, who opposed European federalism in general, drew the line at a common currency, saying the value of the pound sterling should not be set by a European central bank.Mr. Howe argued that only full participation with the European community could restore Britain\u2019s declining influence in the world. His dissent capped growing discontent with Mrs. Thatcher and was widely regarded as the crucial event that precipitated her withdrawal as prime minister. But she, too, had a point. Britain never adopted the euro and retains the pound sterling, the world\u2019s oldest currency still in use.In a half-century in public life, Mr. Howe was one of Britain\u2019s best-known leaders, an owlish, low-key Tory who came of age in a postwar era of strikes, unemployment and inflation. He devoted much of his career to reforming a stagnant economy, restraining unions and rejuvenating Britain\u2019s status as a world power. His efforts were only partly successful, and he never achieved his ambition to be prime minister.But he was solicitor general and minister for trade and consumer affairs in Prime Minister Edward Heath\u2019s cabinet in the early 1970s, and chancellor of the Exchequer and foreign minister in the Thatcher government from 1979 to 1990. Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970, he was a member of the House of Commons for nearly 25 years, and concluded his career with decades in the House of Lords as a life peer.Unlike the confrontational and imperious Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Howe had little charisma or flair for public speaking. In Parliament, he droned through budget and policy speeches, a roly-poly avuncular man with shaggy white hair. Critics called him \u201cMogadon Man,\u201d after a popular tranquilizer, and a Labour Party leader once mocked his docile debating style by likening it to being \u201csavaged by a dead sheep.\u201dBut Mr. Howe was a deft lawyer and negotiator, valued by leaders he served. After Conservatives won power in 1970, he wrote a law banning strikes without union leadership approval and providing 60-day cooling-off periods in strikes involving national interests. His inability to head off a coal miners\u2019 strike forced a national three-day workweek in 1974 to conserve electricity, and the Conservatives were replaced by a Labour government.Mr. Howe returned to the cabinet after Mrs. Thatcher assumed power in 1979. Reversing a postwar British consensus on a welfare state, she and her economy chief cut income taxes, especially for the rich; doubled levies on goods and services; cut spending for housing, education and social programs; created tax-free enterprise zones; and deregulated businesses.\u201cMr. Howe\u2019s route is simple and ambitious,\u201d The Economist said. \u201cAnd horribly hard. It involves the abandonment of the public sector as the prime engine of Britain\u2019s economic growth and its replacement by private initiative.\u201dPainful as the measures were for Britons generally, the economy improved over the next decade. Inflation was lowered and unemployment remained high, but the recession eased. The government undercut unions, whose memberships and strikes declined.Mrs. Thatcher named Mr. Howe foreign secretary in 1983. By then, her government had aligned itself with the Cold War policies of President Ronald Reagan. It tripled Britain\u2019s nuclear strength by buying submarine missile systems from America, and negotiated a deal with China to surrender Hong Kong in 1997.But Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s antipathy to a European union finally alienated Mr. Howe. The immediate sticking point was a European mechanism to set exchange rates as a precursor to a common currency. She believed it would harm Britain\u2019s economy, but Mr. Howe said she was jeopardizing Britain\u2019s future in Europe.Tensions led to a 1989 cabinet shuffle. Mrs. Thatcher named John Major foreign secretary and demoted Mr. Howe to the largely ceremonial post of deputy prime minister. Mr. Howe, the last holdover from the original 1979 Thatcher government, quit the cabinet on Nov. 1, 1990.Two weeks later, he attacked Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s European policies in Parliament.\u201cI have done what I believed to be right to my party and my country,\u201d he said with uncharacteristic passion, and urged fellow Conservatives to join him in abandoning her. \u201cThe time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties\u201d \u2014 to Mrs. Thatcher and to Europe \u2014 \u201cwith which I have myself wrestled for perhaps too long.\u201dMrs. Thatcher listened stony-faced.Public opinion ran heavily against her, and Conservative challengers closed in. Two weeks after Mr. Howe\u2019s speech, Mrs. Thatcher was replaced by John Major. Nicknamed the \u201cIron Lady,\u201d she had been Britain\u2019s first woman prime minister, and the longest-serving of the century.Richard Edward Geoffrey Howe was born in Port Talbot, Wales, on Dec. 20, 1926, to B. Edward and E. F. Thomson Howe. His parents were lawyers and he grew up in relative affluence in a depressed coal-mining district. He attended Winchester College, a prep school, where he took up politics and spoke for women\u2019s rights. After graduating in 1945, he served three years as a British Army officer, then studied law at Cambridge University. He graduated in 1952 and practiced law in Wales.In 1953, he married Elspeth Rosamund Morton Shand. She survives him, as do the couple\u2019s children, a son, Alec, and two daughters, Amanda and Caroline. After two losing tries, he won a seat in Parliament in 1964 and for decades represented constituencies near Liverpool and London. He retired from the House of Commons in 1992 and was made a life peer as Baron Howe of Aberavon.In his memoir, \u201cConflict of Loyalty\u201d (1994), he expressed admiration for Mrs. Thatcher, but regret for hardships imposed on ordinary Britons. \u201cOur principal mistake,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas to give less sympathy and understanding than we should have done to those who faced the upheaval.\u201dKatrin Bennhold contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Bernanke, Anti-Populist", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside FedBen Bernanke is exceptionally polite. In \u201cThe Courage to Act,\u201d a 624-page memoir released this week, Mr. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, describes the presidents and Treasury secretaries he worked with in deeply respectful, not-particularly-revealing terms. It\u2019s hardly the gossipy, blunt assessments that can turn a high official\u2019s memoir into juicy reading.But precisely because of this fact, Mr. Bernanke\u2019s occasional tough criticisms \u2014 of people like his hawkish Fed colleague Thomas Hoenig and the senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders \u2014 stand out as revelatory about the man who guided the United States economy through its most perilous period in modern times. He shows impatience with the messy maw of democracy, implicitly contrasting the bombast of many politicians with the orderly, thoughtful decision-making that was taking place inside the Bernanke Fed.But even as someone who covered intensively the events Mr. Bernanke retells and who has read all those previous books (and wrote one of them), I found the book to be worthwhile reading. It\u2019s just not for the usual reasons one reads a senior government official\u2019s memoir. If the basic narrative of what happened during the crisis and what the Bernanke Fed was thinking is already well established, the book sheds light on many of the smaller dramas that hang over this crucial period of world economic history.Which brings us back to Bernie Sanders and Tom Hoenig.A recurring theme in the book is Mr. Bernanke\u2019s frustration with dissenters \u2014 colleagues at the Fed who disagreed with central bank interventionism, especially when that disagreement was logged publicly. Beneath the surface of these pages is an appreciation for those who play an inside game of behind-closed-doors debate, and disdain for those who fight their policy battles in a more strident, ideological, public way.In August 2008, just before the Lehman Brothers collapse would send the global economy into a tailspin, Mr. Bernanke was primarily worried about financial stability and possible recession. But many of his Fed colleagues were more focused on soaring energy prices and the risks of high inflation, and therefore wanted tighter money.\u201cI find myself conciliating holders of the unreasonable opinion that we should be tightening even as the economy and financial system are in a precarious position and inflation/commodity pressures appear to be easing,\u201d Mr. Bernanke wrote in an email to his vice chairman, Donald Kohn. It had the subject line of \u201cWWGD,\u201d meaning \u201cWhat would Greenspan do?\u201d\u201cToo many dissents, I worried, could undermine our credibility,\u201d Mr. Bernanke writes in his book.Two years later, as the Fed weighed a second round of its controversial program of quantitative easing, known as QE2, he became particularly irritated at how Mr. Hoenig, then the president of the Kansas City Fed, waged a public campaign against the effort.After a \u201cBusinessweek\u201d profile, Mr. Hoenig \u201cappeared to be enjoying the attention,\u201d Mr. Bernanke writes. \u201cI respected his right to dissent, to ask public questions, and to publicly explain his stance. But now I thought he risked undermining public confidence in the Fed and disrupting the committee\u2019s deliberative process by staking out inflexible positions before hearing other committee members\u2019 views.\u201dMr. Bernanke\u2019s comments about political leaders show similar disdain, particularly those on the ideological ends of both parties, describing the efforts on Fed transparency from Mr. Sanders of Vermont and the former representative Ron Paul of Texas in parallel terms.\u201cSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described socialist who caucused with Democrats, seemed to see the world as a vast conspiracy of big corporations and the wealthy,\u201d he writes, adding parenthetically, \u201cCorporations and the wealthy have lots of power, certainly, but in the real world most bad things happen because of ignorance, incompetence, or bad luck, not as a result of grand conspiracies.\u201dIf anything, he is more disdainful of the political shifts in his own party. \u201cIt seemed to me that the crisis had helped to radicalize large parts of the Republican Party,\u201d he writes.He repeatedly expresses disdain for the hypocrisy of members of Congress. When his confirmation for a second term as Fed chairman was in doubt in January 2010, he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d while working the phones with senators who were weighing their vote and indicated they supported him but couldn\u2019t vote for confirmation. \u201cThe callers seemed to believe that voting in opposition to their personal views for political reasons was perfectly natural,\u201d he writes. He quotes one senator as saying \u201csometimes you just have throw some red meat to the knuckle-draggers.\u201dBy contrast, when Mr. Bernanke writes of people he disagreed with at times but who played an inside game \u2014 fighting those battles quietly in meetings in conference rooms within government buildings \u2014 he holds his fire.If you parse Mr. Bernanke\u2019s words carefully and know some back story, you can discern how he disagreed with Larry Summers, when he was an Obama White House official, over the wisdom of nationalizing troubled banks, or with the European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet over the wisdom of fiscal austerity in 2010. But they earn none of the open annoyance he levels at his rivals who lodged more public campaigns.Mr. Bernanke was a career academic who ventured into the center of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy and seems frequently appalled by what he saw.\u201cA dose of populism is healthy for any democracy,\u201d Mr. Bernanke writes. \u201cBut in extreme forms, on either the left or the right, populism can also lead to cynical manipulation of legitimate public anger and to contempt for facts and logical argument. When these aspects of populism dominate political discourse, good governance is nearly impossible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Balenciaga Names Demna Gvasalia, Vetements Designer, as Artistic Director", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by12 PhotosPARIS \u2014 Balenciaga has a gritty new look.Mr. Gvasalia, a 34-year-old Georgian, becomes the third artistic director of Balenciaga in four years. His appointment comes at a crucial time for the brand. Balenciaga is part of Kering\u2019s smaller luxury brands group, along with Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, among others, but it has an outsize fashion presence thanks to its name and history.Though Mr. Gvasalia\u2019s appointment was widely rumored during fashion week, many had dismissed the gossip as unbelievable. The extreme, almost antifashion streetwear aesthetic of Vetements might seem the opposite of the historically elitist Balenciaga.And though Kering is profitable, with net income of \u20ac423 million in the first half, the slack global economy and diminished appetite for luxury goods in China means the company, like other purveyors of high-end goods, can use all the brand energy it can muster.That is the sort of lift Kering presumably hopes Mr. Gvasalia can provide at Balenciaga, in what could be the most radical departure for the fashion house since the Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga established it in Paris in 1936.If Mr. Gvasalia is one of fashion\u2019s democrats, Mr. Balenciaga was its most famous dictator. But Mr. Gvasalia shares the fascination with form found in the original work of Mr. Balenciaga, who was known for his exacting, sculptural creations \u2014 like the sack dress and the cocoon coat \u2014 and for an affinity for breaking rules.Mr. Gvasalia\u2019s work also reflects the current trend of \u201cwardrobing\u201d in fashion \u2014 creating pieces that build on one another, as opposed to creating season-specific fads. The approach has found success at Saint Laurent and Gucci, two other Kering brands, as well as at Louis Vuitton.\u201cClearly, Balenciaga needs to shift gears,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cThey have yet to break through.\u201dVetements, though, has already done so.Vetements made an explosive show debut last season, startling a jaded fashion world with the rawness and immediacy of its work. Though the members of the Vetements team have a clear debt to Mr. Margiela in their desire to take quotidian clothing and reshape it to alter perception, they are unique among current designers in their continued dedication to the idea.\u201cI\u2019m driven by making clothes both wearable and financially accessible, fashion that has a place in the real world,\u201d the bearded and soft-spoken Mr. Gvasalia said in an interview in his vast blacked-out studio in the 10th arrondissement of Paris the day before the announcement.\u201cFinancially accessible\u201d is in the wallet of the beholder. Though they may look unvarnished, Vetements\u2019 clothes are not cheap: On Net-a-Porter, which began stocking them their first season, cotton jersey prairie print dresses cost 1,230 euros, and patchwork jeans were \u20ac1,025. But Alison Loehnis, president of the Net-a-Porter Group, said they were selling well.Mr. Gvasalia will continue in his role as head designer of Vetements while artistic director of Balenciaga.Mr. Wang\u2019s time at Balenciaga did not produce significant critical or commercial growth, however, and he found it difficult to balance the demands of his own brand with that of Balenciaga.Mr. Wang also worked in the shadow of his predecessor, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, who was creative director of Balenciaga for 15 years. Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re took a then-moribund brand and revived it to the extent that it caught the eye of Gucci Group in 2001, which bought it for what would become Kering\u2019s luxury portfolio.Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re left in 2012 after disagreements with the management, and the next year he became creative director of Louis Vuitton, which is owned by Kering\u2019s rival LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. News of Mr. Gvasalia\u2019s announcement here on Wednesday morning overshadowed Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s Louis Vuitton show.If the timing seemed an example of playground politics that was surprising, even by the standards of the fashion world, Kering denied any ulterior motive. The appointment, a spokesman said, was \u201crelated to the internal appointment process.\u201dMr. Gvasalia also worked on the design team at Louis Vuitton from 2012 to 2014, and briefly overlapped there with Mr. Ghesqui\u00e8re.Whether Mr. Gvasalia can shrug off Balenciaga\u2019s received history and create a new voice for the house will be his first test. His debut show for Balenciaga is scheduled for March.Elizabeth Paton contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Dangerous Escalation in Syria", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Putin\u2019s claim that the primary motivation for the bombing is to fight and destroy terrorists, including the Islamic State, is dubious. It is more likely that the Russian leader\u2019s main objective is to rescue President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whose hold on power has weakened as the Syrian Army has lost ground not only to the Islamic State, which is trying to establish a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, but also to a coalition of insurgent groups that is opposed to the Islamic State.Syria is Russia\u2019s chief ally in the Middle East, and Mr. Putin has enabled Mr. Assad throughout the conflict. Mr. Putin could have prevented the turn to violence back in 2011 by persuading his ally not to attack peaceful antigovernment protesters.President Obama appears to have been caught off guard by the bold move to reassert Russian influence in the Middle East, as Mr. Putin no doubt intended. Despite American-led airstrikes, the administration has no real strategy for Syria. There is no obvious Russian strategy either, except for bolstering Mr. Assad, whom Mr. Putin considers the key to stability but most of his brutalized citizens detest.Mr. Putin may have the initiative now, but the risks for Russia, whose economy is suffering from Ukraine-related sanctions and falling oil prices, are real. Before launching the operation, the Russians did not try to work out a plan with the Americans to ensure their respective warplanes would not come in contact.Military experts say that the Russian planes are old and could crash and that Russian weapons may not be precise enough to avoid extensive civilian casualties. Mr. Putin has legitimate concerns about foreign fighters returning home to Russia from Syria, but his new military operation could backfire and make Russia an even greater target of extremists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florence Turns Up the Celebrity Heat", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 You could be forgiven for thinking Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d has turned his shapely back and is looking away.The presence of Jeff Koons\u2019s monumental gilded steel sculpture \u201cPluto and Proserpina,\u201d standing between copies of masterpieces by Donatello and Michelangelo outside Florence\u2019s medieval town hall, is certainly a shock to the eyes.But this is exactly what the old master paintings dealer Fabrizio Moretti had in mind when he invited Mr. Koons to show two sculptures at the Palazzo Vecchio and to cut the opening ribbon at the 29th edition of the Biennale Internazionale dell\u2019Antiquariato di Firenze at the nearby Palazzo Corsini. Both events opened to the public on Sept. 26.\u201cI wanted to combine old masters and contemporary,\u201d Mr. Moretti, the new chairman of BIAF said in a telephone interview. \u201cFlorence is the city of the Renaissance, but it needed new input, and he is an old master painting and sculpture collector.\u201dHigh-end fairs specializing in old masters and antiques, such as BIAF, TEFAF Maastricht and the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris, have struggled to retain and attract buyers in recent years. Mr. Moretti and BIAF\u2019s 88 participating dealerships were hoping that \u201cJeff Koons in Florence\u201d \u2014 a three-month showing of those two sculptures, conceived by the city\u2019s mayor, Dario Nardella, and curated by Sergio Risaliti \u2014 would broaden international interest in Italy\u2019s oldest and most prestigious fair devoted to its own historic art.\u201cPluto and Proserpina,\u201d a work from Mr. Koons\u2019s \u201cAntiquity\u201d series, is the first monumental sculpture to be placed in front of the Palazzo Vecchio in almost five centuries. Dating from 2010-13, the three-meter-high work updates Bernini\u2019s celebrated baroque marble \u201cThe Rape of Proserpine\u201d in glaring mirror-polished steel with live flowers sprouting here and there. Inside the palace, in the Room of the Lilies, Mr. Koons\u2019s 2013 plaster male nude, \u201cGazing Ball (Barberini Faun),\u201d inspired by an ancient Roman statue, reclines with a mirror ball on his knee in front of Donatello\u2019s ferocious 15th-century bronze of Judith chopping off the head of Holofernes.Both Koons works, each from editions of three plus one artist\u2019s proof, are loans from private collections arranged by the New York gallery David Zwirner, which wouldn\u2019t divulge prices for these works. Two dealers with knowledge of the matter, however, said the current gallery prices for Koons works like \u201cPluto and Proserpina\u201d were about $8 million and sculptures from the \u201cGazing Ball\u201d series cost $3 million apiece.\u201cAll of a sudden I had this opportunity to have a dialogue with artists like Michelangelo and Donatello, who are also referencing classical art,\u201d Mr. Koons, 60, said in an interview in the Palazzo Vecchio the day before his exhibition and the BIAF fair opened. He added: \u201cI really feel I\u2019m having a dialogue with the areas that interest me most.\u201dAnd what are these areas?\u201cBringing polarities together. Of harmony,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think of my equilibrium pieces, it\u2019s really like a classical Greek ideal of all pressures being equal, a sense of entropy, of all these forces coming together.\u201d (Mr. Koons came to prominence in the 1980s with his sculptures of basketballs floating in \u201cequilibrium tanks\u201d filled with distilled water.)The artist\u2019s public persona is a disarmingly persuasive blend of evangelical minister and life-insurance salesman. The conceptual inscrutability of what he says about his art seems almost knowingly unrelated to the provocative nature of the art itself. Yet Mr. Koons also articulates a thoughtful fascination with history, which has become a rarity in today\u2019s contemporary art world.\u201cI love this linkage to the past, while being in the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way art functions in its connective power is very similar to our genes. Picasso will be referencing El Greco and El Greco will be making another reference. It\u2019s a community. Information is transferred.\u201dMr. Koons said he felt this connectivity as a collector. His home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan contains an eclectic group of contemporary, modern and historic pieces by artists like John Currin, Courbet, Magritte and Quentin Massys. Several have an edge of eroticism that characterizes much of his own work. In the interview, the artist cited a 1969 Picasso \u201cKiss\u201d painting as a particular inspiration, as well as a 17th-century Nicolas Poussin canvas of Jupiter seducing Antiope, bought at Christie\u2019s in 2008 for $959,400, according to the auction price database Artnet.But wealthy \u201ccrossover\u201d buyers like Mr. Koons are few and far between. As the specialist collector-base is aging, and museums are increasingly short of funds, traditional art and antiques fairs have to find ways broaden their international appeal.Florence\u2019s BIAF displays only Italian art or art that has been significantly influenced by Italy. As such, the fair faces the additional challenges of a moribund domestic economy and a Mussolini-vintage law that deems all artworks created more than 50 years ago, regardless of value, require an export licence to leave the country. Works officially \u201cnotified\u201d as national heritage can only be sold to Italians.At the event, Arnolfo di Cambio\u2019s superb 13th-century marble statue of an apostle, from the original fa\u00e7ade of Florence Cathedral, was priced at 2 million euros, about $2.2 million, by the Munich and Turin dealers Mehringer & Benappi. Another work on sale was Luca Giordano\u2019s opulent 1675-80 Neapolitan School painting \u201cThe Rape of Europa,\u201d priced at \u20ac1.5 million by the London, Milan and St. Moritz dealers Robilant + Voena. Both prices, significantly below international market values, reflected the \u201cnotificato\u201d status of these works.Responding to these constraints, Mr. Moretti bolstered international participation in this year\u2019s BIAF by inviting dealers like Dr. J\u00f6rn G\u00fcnther Rare Books from Switzerland and the New York old master painting specialist Otto Naumann, raising the tally of non-Italian names to 27.Dr. G\u00fcnther, in keeping the Italophile ethos of the fair, showed an outstanding selection of printed books and manuscripts by Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, brought to the fair on temporary export licenses for prices as high as \u20ac5 million. Equally important, he also brought to Florence two of his wealthiest international clients \u2014 one from South America, the other from central Europe. Bruce Springsteen\u2019s manager, Jon Landau, was among the other foreign collectors spotted in BIAF\u2019s predominantly Italian crowd.\u201cThis event is refreshingly old fashioned,\u201d Dr. G\u00fcnther said in an interview at the Sept. 25 preview, referring to the previous evening\u2019s black-tie dinner for 600 V.I.P. guests (including Mr. Koons), culminating in a spectacular firework display on the Arno river.Mr. Naumann showed the early 1630s painting \u201cThe Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew,\u201d made by the Dutch baroque artist Matthias Stomer while working in Rome. Bought in grimy original condition for $845,000 at Christie\u2019s New York in January, it has been cleaned and was priced at $1.75 million.The Stomer was another of several museum-quality works temporarily imported into Italy for the fair, so free to be bought by international collectors.Arguably the most spectacular of them all was the neoclassical marble sculpture, \u201cThe Genius of the Arts Unveiling Nature,\u201d made by the Austrian artist Leopold Kiesling in Rome in 1808-1809 while working under the influence of Canova. Consisting of an idealized male nude revealing an archaic bronze-inset figure of Diana of Ephesus, this superbly carved allegory, from a Swiss collection, was one of the most important neoclassical sculptures to come on the market in recent years. It was offered by the Rome dealers Galleria Carlo Virgilio with a price tag of \u20ac1.8 million \u2014 about a quarter of the price of Mr. Koons\u2019s \u201cPluto and Proserpina.\u201dAt the time of writing, around the mid-point of the fair, the Kiesling, like so many of the big-ticket items there, was attracting interest, but had yet to find a confirmed buyer.Admittedly, major sales at traditional events like BIAF do tend to take some time. But the fact remains that for all the publicity generated by Mr. Koons\u2019s involvement in Florence, the biennale remains, as yet, stubbornly national, and the trade in old master paintings and sculptures stubbornly specialized.\u201cThe problem is that old masters are a niche market,\u201d said Mr. Moretti, the chairman of BIAF. They are \u201cinexpensive compared to contemporary. But an artist like Andy Warhol is an icon.\u201dMr. Koons has also produced plenty of works \u2014 the French porcelain maker Bernardaud has just created an edition of 2,300 miniature yellow \u201cBalloon Dogs,\u201d priced at $8,000 each \u2014 and he could be said to be an artistic icon.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Matthias Stomer and Leopold Kiesling.An earlier version of this article misstated the material of Mr. Koons\u2019s 2013 male nude, \u201cGazing Ball (Barberini Faun).\u201d It is made of plaster, not synthetic marble.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the creator of a sculpture that was next to a work by Jeff Koons and Michelangelo. It was by Baccio Bandinelli, not Donatello.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Preparing for Financial Shocks Before They Strike", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserA single unexpected expense can push many American households into financial hardship, a new report finds.Most households have at least a loose budget for recurring expenses like housing, food and transportation. But other expenses are often unplanned, and such \u201cshocks\u201d can throw families for a financial loop, Pew found.Sixty-percent of the households in the United States, regardless of income, said they had suffered a financial shock in the last year, and a third had suffered two or more, the report found.Pew defines a shock as an unexpected expense or loss of income. Most often, the expense is major car repair, followed closely by costs like a big home repair, an illness that requires a visit to the hospital, the loss of a job or a cut in work hours or pay.Other types of shocks cited included veterinary bills, funeral expenses and moving costs.\u201cFinancial shocks are both common and damaging to family finances,\u201d said Clinton Key, a Pew research officer specializing in financial security and mobility, in a call this week to discuss the findings with reporters.The median cost of the highest reported shock was $2,000, but amounts ranged from less than $800 to as much as $6,000. Recovering from such an unplanned expense can be difficult: More than half of the households said they struggled to make ends meet after experiencing their most expensive shock.Younger and lower-income households were more likely to say their financial shock was \u201cdestabilizing,\u201d or had made it difficult to pay their basic bills.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any slack in their budget,\u201d Mr. Key said. \u201cAnd then the shock happens.\u201dBut even among those with incomes of $85,000 or more, 42 percent said they had not recovered financially by the time of the survey.The typical household spent about half of its monthly income on its most expensive shock.Here are some questions and answers about preparing for financial shocks:Many financial advisers use a rule of thumb of three to six months of living expenses, Mr. Key said. While Pew isn\u2019t making specific savings recommendations based on its findings, he said, it might be useful for consumers to take into account the range of the most expensive shocks reported \u2014 $800 to $6,000, with a median of $2,000 \u2014 when setting their own savings goals.Lauren Locker, a financial planner in Little Falls, N.J., said she heard many excuses from clients for their lack of emergency funds, but in today\u2019s uncertain economy it is an absolute necessity. \u201cYou have to have an emergency fund, and it has to be on autopilot,\u201d she said. Regardless of the amount you save, she said, have it automatically transferred regularly from your checking account into a separate savings or brokerage account.It is often easier for people to continue saving, she said, once they make initial progress. So if it seems too hard to get started, she said, consider taking a seasonal job \u2014 the holidays are coming, and retailers may hire extra staff \u2014 and use the extra income to start your emergency fund. Or, if you had a recurring expense that has ended \u2014 say, a child care bill that stops once a child starts school or a car loan that is paid off \u2014 continue putting that amount into savings.The most important step may be learning to expect the unexpected. \u201cEveryone knows if you have a car, it\u2019s going to break down,\u201d Mr. Key said in a follow-up interview. \u201cBut nobody really thinks it\u2019s going to happen today.\u201dMs. Locker said it was common during the financial downturn for clients to call her and say, \u201cI lost my job. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The time to prepare for losing a job and the resulting financial impact, she advised, is before it happens. \u201cNever assume job security.\u201d For older workers, in particular, this means staying current with a digital r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and networking tools, like LinkedIn. She even suggests testing the waters periodically by applying for job, to keep abreast of what is happening in a client\u2019s industry and to keep interview skills fresh.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Flurry of Deals, the Beginning of the End?", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe first day of Wall Street\u2019s workweek normally comes with the announcement of a corporate merger or two, hence the nickname \u201cMerger Monday.\u201d But these days, a more appropriate moniker might be \u201cManic Monday.\u201dThere was more than $170 billion of deal-making unveiled on Monday. Dell agreed to acquire EMC, the storage provider, in a deal worth about $67 billion, and Anheuser-Busch InBev said it had raised its bid for SABMiller to about $103 billion. Add in a few smaller transactions and you have one of the biggest days ever in Wall Street deal-making. Mergers and acquisitions are on track for a record year. So far in 2015, there have been nearly $3.5 trillion worth of transactions, according to Thomson Reuters. One Wall Street banker described Monday as feeling \u201ca little bit like 1986 or maybe 2007.\u201d If that\u2019s right, these deals do not portend good things, and will likely represent the end \u2014 or at least the beginning of the end \u2014 of a bull market.That doesn\u2019t mean the market is going to falter tomorrow, or even in the coming months. If history is any guide, there is likely a year of more deal-making, and with interest rates likely to remain low, it is possible it could go on even longer. When Wall Street banks announce their earnings over the next two weeks, expect talk of an unusually long list of deals in the pipeline. But to many astute financial minds, this level of deal-making is unsustainable.In June, this column pointed out that the latest spate of deal-making was a sign of a weak economy. But these deals may underscore something graver: weak fundamentals. Consider what\u2019s behind Monday\u2019s announcements: businesses that are under siege and trying to transform themselves. In the case of Dell-EMC, Dell is trying to move away from its personal computer business while EMC has been struggling in the face of a changing environment for computer storage. According to my colleague Peter Eavis, Dell\u2019s private numbers reflect a net loss of $768 million, compared with a $570 million loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was also down, falling to $27.5 billion in the latest six months, from $29.5 billion in the year-earlier period. The deal may very well work \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s probably what both companies should be doing \u2014 but the transaction is hardly being struck from a position of strength.The same is true of the possible Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller tie-up. Market share has declined for both companies and sales have fallen in developed countries, where microbrews are stealing significant market share. The rationale for merging is very clear: cost-cutting.Both of these deals may turn out to be good for shareholders, but they both say a lot about what\u2019s driving the current round of mergers and perhaps more important, the larger economic forces at work. Big companies that have been cutting their way to profitability for the last several years have run out of costs to cut. So what do they do? Merge to cut costs even more.\u201cCorporate consolidation can perhaps provide some last drops of stock market intoxication,\u201d Spiros Malandrakis, an analyst at Euromonitor, wrote last month about the potential beer merger.If you were to lay the performance of the S.&P. 500 over a chart of deal volume over the last 30 years, you\u2019d see that deal-making is a lagging, not a forward-looking, indicator to the stock market. In other words, a rise in deal volume follows a rise in the stock market; it doesn\u2019t come ahead of it. Also, there is often a spike in deal-making in the year and a half before a major market correction. The biggest deals tend to happen at the end of a bull market cycle, like the 2007 leveraged buyout of the Texas utility TXU, which ended with a bankruptcy filing last year. Of course, deals would make more sense at the beginning of a cycle, but chief executives are usually too worried about their own businesses to take a large risk.Dell is certainly taking a big risk, as the deal for EMC will saddle it with $50 billion of debt. Meg Whitman, the chief of Hewlett-Packard, used the transaction\u2019s heavy leverage to take a jab at her rival. \u201cTo pay back the interest on the $50 billion of debt that the new combined company will have on their balance sheet, Dell will need to pay roughly $2.5 billion a year in interest alone,\u201d she wrote in a note to her employees. \u201cThat\u2019s $2.5 billion that they will allocate away from R.&D. and other business-critical activities, which will keep them from better serving their customers.\u201dThat might be true, but Moody\u2019s is actually planning to upgrade Dell\u2019s debt based on the deal, contending the numbers make sense: \u201cDespite the significant increase in debt and initial leverage, Dell\u2019s overall credit profile will be enhanced with the acquisition of EMC, a merger that will create the largest private technology company in the world based on revenues.\u201dSurely, the Dell-EMC deal and the potential beer combination are far more logical than pie-in-the-sky deals driven by illusory goals or fantastical synergy claims, such as the infamous AOL-Time Warner merger in 1999, widely considered the worst deal ever. We haven\u2019t seen anything that silly \u2014 yet. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Self-Inflicted Disaster", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorANKARA, Turkey \u2014 On Oct. 10, a suicide bomb attack killed over 100 people in the center of Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara. The suspected perpetrators were part of an Islamic State cell in Turkey. What is more unnerving is that many saw it coming.In June, a large pro-Kurdish election rally in Diyarbakir was attacked, killing four and injuring many more; in July, a horrendous suicide attack targeted socialist youth in Suruc, killing 33. Ominously, a number of Turkish columnists warned the government openly about potential bombers \u2014 even providing the names of some of them.Unfortunately, Turkey\u2019s government seems more interested these days in punishing those who insult the president on Twitter than in tracking Islamic State cells in the country. Since 2013, Turkey\u2019s president has created a political climate in which domestic Islamic State cells have found it easy to prosper. Until very recently, Turkish security forces have been soft on Islamic State operatives and lax about their movements across the border.Worse, as more information about the Ankara suicide bombers emerges, it\u2019s clear that there were gross intelligence failures. The father of one of the suicide bombers pleaded with authorities to keep his son in custody, but the police let him go. The government\u2019s ban on news reports about the incident has further clouded the situation.Not surprisingly, many Turks now feel that the social contract between the people and the government has been broken and there is no going back. Quite simply, the government has failed to protect them.As a former member of the ruling Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., who served in Parliament from 2007 to 2011 and was on the party\u2019s executive committee, this has been a deeply disappointing process to watch. The A.K.P. was once the most progressive force in Turkish politics, but it has undergone a damaging transformation since the fateful Gezi Park protests of 2013.Although I am a former air force officer and I believe strongly in the virtues of a secular state, I joined the A.K.P. in 2007 because I believed Turkey was at a critical juncture. I had little regard for the militant secularism and nationalism harbored by many within Turkey\u2019s old establishment. The election of Abdullah Gul in 2007, who was almost blocked from becoming president because his wife wore a head scarf, was a critical moment for the consolidation of our democracy. By that time, the A.K.P. had already put Turkey into accession negotiations with the European Union, managed an impressive economic growth story and improved Turkey\u2019s international standing. In many quarters, Turkey was seen as an inspiration for other Muslim countries.It\u2019s true that the A.K.P. was never a liberal party, but it had a clear interest in Turkey\u2019s democratization. That\u2019s why the party enjoyed support from democrats, liberals and some social democrats who were eager to balance the excesses of the stern old secularist regime. Both in Parliament and abroad we enjoyed the moral high ground of normalizing civil-military relations, overseeing a growing economy and obtaining greater democratic legitimacy through growing support from the electorate. I comforted myself in thinking that the European accession process would serve as an anchor if the A.K.P.\u2019s conservatism ever pulled the country off course.By 2009, the process had slowed down. Then, in September 2010, a referendum allowed Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then the prime minister and now the president, to shape the judiciary to his own liking. After that vote, he believed he had defeated the establishment for good. Regrettably, he came to the conclusion that he no longer needed the moderates in the party.When I examined the new candidates list in 2011 I immediately understood what was going on. He had decided to root out all of the democrats, liberals and moderate conservatives. Those who replaced us were ideologically conservative Islamists who showed absolute loyalty to him.However, few were willing to make a fuss about it as the A.K.P. won its third consecutive election with a record 50 percent of the vote. The purge of centrists continued in the party\u2019s 2012 convention. Those who asked questions, offered constructive criticism or were generally disposed to moderation were kicked off the executive committee. The consolidation of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip was complete.I disassociated myself with the party after the convention and took part in the 2013 Gezi Park protests.A few months later, major corruption scandals put Mr. Erdogan and the party on an irreversible path. He turned authoritarian, the country became increasingly polarized, the Kurdish peace process collapsed after the June election and violence by the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., broke out again.Stubborn insistence on a disastrous Syria policy further dragged the country into a regional quagmire. Turkey\u2019s inability to oust Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria led the government to support radical elements fighting Mr. Assad while Turkey became host to more than two million Syrian refugees.What started out as an impressive political journey is now heading toward disaster.It is clear that the A.K.P.\u2019s promise to consolidate Turkish democracy, solve the Kurdish question and join the European Union has utterly failed.It did not have to be this way. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s desperate choices for his personal survival have doomed the party and poisoned the spirit of our nation. Mr. Erdogan has squandered a historic opportunity to consolidate Turkish democracy, transform Turkey into a First World country and bridge differences between secularists and conservatives, Turks and Kurds and Sunnis and Alevis. The absence of a viable, united opposition makes the situation even worse.If the A.K.P. is not defeated in the Nov. 1 election, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarianism and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu\u2019s foreign policy could suck Turkey deeper into the Middle East\u2019s vortex of violence.Turkey is in desperate need of new leadership and political wisdom to get out of this mess.Advertisement"}

She cited the current plunge in oil prices, the amount of offshore acreage already under lease and Shell\u2019s recent decision to put off further drilling after spending $7 billion on a project that ended up producing no oil.Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, called it a \u201cstunning, shortsighted move,\u201d adding that it was \u201cthe latest in a destructive pattern of hostility\u201d displayed by the Obama administration toward the energy industry in the state. Several other oil companies had already decided to suspend plans to operate in the Alaskan Arctic, where winter darkness and harsh conditions make drilling expensive and potentially harmful to the fragile environment.Environmentalists applauded the move after months of criticizing the administration for allowing Shell to go forward. Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for the Wilderness Society, called the decision \u201centirely reasonable\u201d because of Shell\u2019s failure.Seven companies hold drilling rights in the Chukchi Sea, the area with the highest production potential, but Shell was the only one to begin an active exploration program. Shell\u2019s many accidents and delays served as a cautionary example to other companies even before the price of oil collapsed by more than half over the last year.For years, the Arctic appeared to be the next big frontier for oil companies with old, mature reserves. But with the advent of hydraulic fracturing of shale fields, the United States has become glutted with oil.Offshore Arctic drilling is not only in decline in the United States but also in Canada and Greenland. Western sanctions over Russia\u2019s policies in Ukraine have slowed exploration in the Russian Arctic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Sands Boom Dries Up in Alberta, Taking Thousands of Jobs With It", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet Alberta Highway 63, the major artery connecting Northern Alberta\u2019s oil sands with the rest of the country, still buzzes with traffic. Tractor-trailers hauling loads that resemble rolling petrochemical plants parade past fleets of buses used to shuttle workers. Most vehicles carry \u201cbuggy whips\u201d \u2014 bright orange pennants attached to tall spring-loaded wands \u2014 to help prevent them from being run over by the 1.6-million-pound dump trucks used in the oil sands mines.Despite a severe economic downturn in a region whose growth once seemed limitless, many energy companies have too much invested in the oil sands to slow down or turn off the taps. In addition to the continued operation of existing plants, construction persists on projects that began before the price fell, largely because billions of dollars have already been spent on them. Oil sands projects are based on 40-year investment time frames, so their owners are being forced to wait out slumps.\u201cIt really is tough right now,\u201d said Greg Stringham, the vice president for markets and oil sands at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, a trade group that generally speaks for the industry in Alberta. \u201cWe see kind of a lot of volatility over the next four or five years.\u201dCanada is now dealing with the economic fallout, having slipped into a mild recession earlier this year. And Alberta, which relies most heavily on oil royalties, now expects to post a deficit of 6 billion Canadian dollars, or about $4.5 billion. The political landscape has also shifted.12 PhotosLast spring, a left-of-center government ended four decades of Conservative rule in Alberta. Federally, polls suggest that the Conservative party \u2014 which championed Keystone XL and repeatedly resisted calls for stricter greenhouse gas emission controls in the oil sands \u2014 is struggling to get re-elected in October.\u201cThe pendulum has swung,\u201d said Stephen Ross, the president of Devonian Properties, an Alberta development company that has built several residential and commercial properties in Fort McMurray.Since the end of the World War ll, oil has made Alberta wealthy. The increase in oil sands development since the early 2000s had only intensified the province\u2019s good fortune and turned obscure Fort McMurray into a boomtown and an outsize contributor to the entire Canadian economy.When Mr. Ross first bought development land here in 2000, he paid about 27,000 Canadian dollars an acre. He stopped buying land long before it hit one million Canadian dollars an acre.\u201cThe town has had huge growing pains,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s like something you\u2019ve never seen.\u201dOperating oil sands plants quickly decreased budgets and cut services, like equipment cleaning, which were deemed optional. And as portions of construction projects are finished, construction workers are sent packing. The halt on new projects has left order books increasingly blank at a variety of suppliers, like engineering firms.These projects, and others that have begun over the last 15 years, have largely been built and operated by an itinerant work force. These workers fly into Fort McMurray\u2019s new airport terminal and are bused to work camps up to two hours away. Their lives are a cycle of three straight weeks of long shifts interrupted by 10-day trips home.That transient population has little or no connection to the city when working. When laid off, they become unemployment statistics, not in Alberta, but in the provinces of their hometowns. It\u2019s also in those regions, more than Alberta, where the loss of once-large paychecks is most felt, having a ripple effect across the country.One executive and investor, who did not want to be named while the province is reviewing his industry, said growing sentiment that the industry does not pay Alberta enough in royalties and lags on environmental protections will kill new investments, even if prices start to rise.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a time when I\u2019ve been less optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t know how bad it is. It just hasn\u2019t hit yet.\u201dHe did, however, acknowledge that environmentalists had won the debate on Keystone XL as well as various other pipeline plans.\u201cI don\u2019t know how the issue got away, but it\u2019s obvious now that it did,\u201d he said.And the workers who have benefited from the boom are now realizing that their stretch of good luck might be over, permanently.R\u00e9jean Godin, a truck driver and heavy equipment operator, began the long-distance commute from the Atlantic province of New Brunswick 13 years ago. Since then, he\u2019s earned wages four or five times the rate of those back home, an area of high unemployment.Standing near his well-worn Toyota RAV4 that still bears New Brunswick license plates, Mr. Godin, who lives in a work camp, recited all of the different projects in which hundreds of workers had been laid off \u2014 layoffs that he\u2019d learned about over the previous few days. He fears that the days of high pay for delivering water to work camps and hauling their sewage away may be over for both himself and his 30-year-old son, who joined him in Alberta.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re going to come next year,\u201d Mr. Godin said in the dusty yard of a trucking company in Fort MacKay, Alberta, a town down the Athabasca River from Fort McMurray. \u201cWhat you hear everywhere is the price is low so we\u2019ve got to cut this, we\u2019ve got to shut that down a little bit.

LetterOne said in April that it was planning to spend up to $16 billion on telecom acquisitions.Since then, Brazil\u2019s economy and TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es\u2019 business model have deteriorated.The company\u2019s revenue is falling, its cash flow is negative, and it has lost about a third of its value on the S\u00e3o Paulo stock exchange over the last year.For Oi, Mr. Fridman\u2019s cash might be a way out of a mountain of debt.But it is far from certain that Mr. Fridman\u2019s offer will indeed lead to a merger.Jonathan Dann, telecommunications analyst with RBC Capital Markets in London, said that even though a merger between Oi and TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es would have an \u201cindustry logic,\u201d it was not clear how a deal could simultaneously reduce Oi\u2019s debt, keep Oi\u2019s shareholders from suffering dilution and meet Telecom Italia\u2019s likely need for either a large cash payment or control of the new company.\u201cThis will be a very challenging deal to structure,\u201d Mr. Dann said.In statement, TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es said that no negotiations were currently underway with either Oi or LetterOne about a possible merger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carly Fiorina: The Marketing Genius", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarly Fiorina\u2019s presidential campaign has been built on confrontational moments. With impregnable self-confidence and a fearless intensity, she has out-Trumped Trump and landed the most telling and quotable blows on Hillary Clinton.In such a giant field of candidates what matters most is the ability to grab the spotlight. The era of YouTube and FaceTime video links has further magnified the power of a candidate who can create significant moments. Fiorina is great at it, perfectly suited to this environment.She can go on MSNBC or some other outlet and bludgeon a host with a barrage of forcefully delivered bullet points, which then goes viral. When challenged on the accuracy or fairness of her assertions, she blasts straight through.Clinton and Fiorina appeared back to back on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d recently. Clinton was challenged on the email issue and tried affably to defend her conduct. Fiorina was challenged on the existence of a Planned Parenthood video she claims to have seen.In contrast to Clinton, Fiorina simply refused to adopt a defensive posture. She ignored the challenges and just hit Planned Parenthood harder. The factual issue sort of got lost in her torrent. She was stylistically indomitable even if she didn\u2019t address the substance of the critique.And yet for all her feisty outsider bravado, if you actually look at her views on substance and her behavior in the past, she is a completely conventional Republican. She was a strong supporter of John McCain and Mitt Romney, the last two nominees. A lot of her language is the normal, vague corporate-speak about \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201cunlocking potential,\u201d and understanding the economy.On policy grounds her views are orthodox. She doesn\u2019t want to move the party to the left or right, or in a more populist, libertarian or moderate direction. Her core argument on the stump is that government has gotten too big and is crushing business, which is hardly an innovative message in a Republican primary.On issues where her views once contradicted the current fashion, like No Child Left Behind, and a path to citizenship for immigrants, she has moved to be where Republican voters now are. She is where the consumers want her to be.In short, stylistically she is a renegade outsider, but substantively she\u2019s completely establishmentarian. Another way to say it is that her campaign is brilliantly creative in its marketing arm, but unimaginative when it comes to product development.And this is where her business background comes into view. When she ran Hewlett-Packard the core critique against her was that she was really good at marketing but not good at tech or operations.The positive theory of her campaign is that she\u2019s perfectly suited for a Republican electorate that wants to vent its outrage at the political class and the timid party leadership, but which doesn\u2019t really believe in any alternative direction. She gives the G.O.P. establishment rebellious fire, but is actually one of them.The more likely scenario is that Fiorina fades over the next few months. In this race there\u2019s been a huge gap between the campaigners, like Trump, Carson and Fiorina, and the governors \u2014 those with actual experience in government.In this early phase the voters are indulging in a little free outrage, enjoying the campaigners. But history teaches that parties invariably nominate government officials. Sooner or later, voters want a candidate rooted in something more than a marketing strategy. They want someone authentically connected to middle-class concerns and with strategies for their specific challenges, like wage stagnation.Opposing the political class is not an agenda. Unless Fiorina can become a lot more creative and sympathetically connected to working-class voters, she\u2019ll fall to an opponent who will turn to her in debate and ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Struggle to Make Carbon Capture Viable", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyLONDON \u2014 Deep in Canada\u2019s oil country, a group of energy companies is trying to perform something close to a miracle: making dirty fossil fuels green.The project \u2014 buoyed by grants from the Canadian government reaching almost $1 billion \u2014 involves capturing carbon dioxide from an oil plant near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, and then pumping the emissions deep underground, out of harm\u2019s way.Despite the energy companies\u2019 efforts, the project in Alberta remains one of the few bright spots in the decade-long global push to bring carbon capture and storage technology into the mainstream.Since the mid-2000s, several demonstration projects, from the United States to Spain, have received hundreds of millions of combined government support \u2014 and additional private funding \u2014 to show that the technology can significantly reduce carbon emissions from the world\u2019s dirtiest power and industrial plants.So far, however, few projects have proved their worth.A combination of skyrocketing construction costs and volatile energy prices have made it difficult for companies and governments to quantify the often eye-watering investments. Analysts have questioned how the carbon-capturing technology, which has been used for decades in the oil industry, can be rolled out efficiently \u2014 and safely \u2014 in heavily polluting power plants.Environmental campaigners and some national politicians have balked at spending huge amounts of money on legacy fossil-fuel infrastructure when public money could be spent on newer technologies like offshore wind farms and solar energy parks.\u201cThe attempts to overcome the high barriers for the technology haven\u2019t really worked,\u201d said Samuela Bassi, an environmental policy analyst at the London School of Economics.Carbon capture and storage \u201cis a hefty investment,\u201d she added. \u201cBut even if it\u2019s expensive, we will need to find a way of bringing it into the overall energy mix.\u201dThe attempts to make the technology commercially viable come as most policy makers, energy companies and even some environmentalists acknowledge that there are few alternatives to reducing global carbon emissions.While the likes of wind and solar power have become increasingly widespread, especially in Europe and North America, fossil fuels are still the source for roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s total electricity generation, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. That is particularly true in emerging markets like China, Brazil and India that are investing heavily in their energy infrastructure to bolster their domestic economies.Combined with heavy-polluting industrial processes like steel and cement manufacturing, fossil fuels are likely to play a role in almost all economic activity for decades to come, according to analysts. Energy executives say that this will require investing in solutions \u2014 like capturing carbon and storing it underground \u2014 that can help meet global goals of limiting temperature increases to just 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, from preindustrial levels.\u201cFossil fuels aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d said Andy Purvis, the European general manager at the Global C.C.S. Institute, a trade body, in Brussels. \u201cYou have to try to find ways of reducing those emissions.\u201dFor most backers of carbon capture and storage, however, the major barrier remains its high price tag.In Europe, for example, it would cost up to a combined $40 billion by 2030 to install the technology to cover 11 gigawatts of fossil fuel generation, or roughly 10 coal or natural gas power plants, according to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.The complex infrastructure required to capture carbon from plants, transport the emissions through miles of pipelines and store the cocktail of gases deep underground also puts the technology beyond the grasp of most utilities.Analysts say, for instance, that capturing carbon can almost double the cost of building a new coal-fired power plant, and can add up to 50 percent to the price of a natural gas facility.And unlike the funding available for environmentally friendlier energy sources like wind and solar power, which receive substantial subsidies and tax breaks from national governments, no similar help is available in most countries for capturing and storing carbon.The lack of a credible price on carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 at a regional or global scale \u2014 that would make the technology more cost-effective compared to dirtier alternatives also has reduced the appetite for most energy producers.\u201cPublic commitments to help this technology need to be more sustainable,\u201d said Matt Farren-Handford, a senior manager in the climate change and sustainability practice in Houston at Ernst & Young, the consulting firm. \u201cWe\u2019re talking tens of billions of dollars to be spent on projects. Companies need regulatory support.\u201dThese price pressures have taken their toll, even as energy companies, governments and research institutes continue to clamor for more funding to prove that capturing carbon can help reduce emissions.This year, the United States government pulled support from a new coal power plant to be built in Illinois that would have included the carbon-reducing technology. American policy makers said the project\u2019s private backers could not meet a deadline to secure investment for the facility.In Europe, three carbon-capture projects in Germany, Italy and Poland have also been scrapped because of a lack of financial support, along with questions over legal liability if the emissions escaped from underground storage facilities and public anger about fossil-fuel projects.The number of test projects worldwide has almost halved in the last five years, to less than 20 projects, according to industry statistics.\u201cPeople are paying close attention to how the technology is developing, but we are nowhere near where we need to be,\u201d said Kevin Magner, a director in the government and infrastructure practice at Deloitte, the consulting firm, in London. \u201cThere needs to be more political will to make this happen.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor Faces \u2018Rite of Passage\u2019: A Campaign Seeking His Exit", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawrence JournalLAWRENCE, Mass. \u2014 Daniel Rivera, a first-term mayor who promised to change the pockmarked political landscape of this underdog mill city, has not been charged with a crime or accused of graft.And yet a group of constituents seeks to force him from office through a recall, complaining of unilateral decision making and the firing of city workers as political retaliation. He is the fifth mayor here to face such proceedings \u2014 none of which have made it to the ballot so far \u2014 in the past 25 years.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rite of passage for mayors\u201d in Lawrence, said Mr. Rivera\u2019s lawyer, Sal Tabit. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, but it\u2019s true.\u201dThe recall effort, which has been slowed by legal proceedings, is the kind of political turbulence that many here would like to avoid. But the recall\u2019s leaders say Mr. Rivera is out of touch with constituents and has broken rules with his hiring and firing; the mayor says his critics are unhappy because his efforts have disrupted the pervasive cronyism that has been suspected in the city.Lawrence is among dozens of midsize New England cities that have struggled over the years to find their economic footing after factory shutdowns, even as larger American cities, like Boston, New York and San Francisco, absorb ever-higher levels of wealth. The challenges here have contributed to the political turmoil.\u201cThe thing about New England is that we have real poverty,\u201d said Benjamin Forman, the research director at MassINC, a think tank in Boston. \u201cWe just concentrate it in places, and that\u2019s the case in Lawrence.\u201d He added: \u201cAll of these cities are under enormous stress, and the leaders that are leading them don\u2019t have the tools to do the job they\u2019re hired to do. That just creates instability.\u201dBy many accounts, Lawrence has been on an upswing, with strong nonprofits, improving schools, the redevelopment of some mills and declines in unemployment. \u201cThere are wounds from the previous political battles,\u201d Mr. Forman said, \u201cbut I think the larger community is moving in a positive direction, and I think that energy\u2019s palpable.\u201dAnother recall effort, some residents say, would simply feed a long-held stereotype of the city as fractious and chaotic, turning off outsiders who could bring business or philanthropy to a city on the rise.\u201cI think it only serves to disrupt good governance, and I think in the past it\u2019s only served to create divisions in the community,\u201d said Michael R. Sweeney, a former city councilor who now runs the State Lottery. He considers himself a Rivera supporter, though he is on good terms with some who oppose the mayor.\u201cLawrence,\u201d he said, \u201cis not a community that can afford those types of distractions.\u201dThis city, on the banks of the Merrimack River, has a history of rough-and-tumble politics. Mr. Rivera\u2019s immediate predecessor, William Lantigua, was deeply divisive, commanding the support of those who viewed him as a man of the people while facing suspicions of corruption and cronyism and his own recall attempts. Mr. Rivera beat him in 2013 by fewer than 100 votes.\u201cI think sometimes people forget that we got elected to undo some of the things that they did,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cWe want to do things that people think, these things will never change, it\u2019s Lawrence.\u201dOne step, he said, has been to remove unqualified city workers, but critics say he has violated the city charter with some of those terminations and made Lawrence vulnerable to lawsuits.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that because he wants to show the outsiders that he\u2019s a no-nonsense mayor, he\u2019s taking a stand that is going to hurt our city,\u201d said the City Council president, Modesto Maldonado, who has been a vocal opponent of Mr. Rivera but is not formally involved in the recall. He added, \u201cWe are a city with a lot of problems, and obviously there is a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction on the part of the citizens.\u201dLast month, a group called the Foundation for Transparency in Government gathered 181 affidavits \u2014 only 100 are needed to start the recall process \u2014 listing numerous grievances against Mr. Rivera. These included complaints over his hiring and firing practices and over a failure to reopen a pedestrian bridge and two firehouses.\u201cWhen you have a mayor that just isn\u2019t accessible and really isn\u2019t meeting the needs of the people, save a small group of elite supporters, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said William Green, a police officer who is among the recall\u2019s leaders and who was disciplined by the mayor for not reporting work he did while off duty.The mayor and his supporters have repeatedly pointed out that among the recall bid\u2019s leaders or representatives are people he has tried to discipline or who owed back taxes, as well as supporters of Mr. Lantigua. (Those involved in the recall effort say there is no personal motivation.) Some have complained that 100 affidavits is too low a bar to start the process of a recall.\u201cIt\u2019s just a mechanism to slow down the positive change,\u201d Mr. Rivera said about the push for a recall. \u201cUnfortunately, the collateral damage is the city\u2019s reputation, and people start thinking, \u2018Hey, this is old crazy Lawrence again.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe Board of Registrars, a city body that oversees elections, on Thursday began to hear his claims that dozens of affidavits are invalid; that process is set to continue this week. Organizers hope they will then be permitted to gather about 5,600 petition signatures and move the recall forward.Lawrence was founded in the mid-1800s by industrialists who wanted to build a neat and efficient mill town. Immigrants came here for work, and the city prospered until the decline of manufacturing in the mid-1900s gutted the city\u2019s economy.\u201cThe city was created and laid out to be ultimately a place that had millworkers within walking distance of mills,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.\u201cIt was not built to be flexible or to be able to change.\u201dThe buildings housing those mills are still here, gargantuan constructions of brick and glass that stare quietly over the river. Some now hold affordable housing or business, though not on the scale of the city\u2019s past.The city kept drawing immigrants \u2014 Latinos make up 74 percent of the population here, but only 10 percent of the statewide population \u2014 but it has never recovered its main economic engine. According to the census, 29 percent of this city\u2019s residents lived in poverty in 2013, well above the state\u2019s average.Lawrence is not the only New England city where political and economic difficulties have gone hand in hand. Last year, voters in Fall River, Mass., another relatively poor postindustrial city, successfully recalled their mayor amid anger over Fire Department layoffs and accusations that he had threatened a city councilor with a gun.\u201cIt tends to happen a bit more in older, industrial cities that have higher unemployment, where government tends to be a larger employer, where factions can develop more easily,\u201d said Jim Stergios, the executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a research organization in Boston.Many here do not expect the Rivera recall bid to go so far, calling it a vestige of the city\u2019s past.\u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of a silly distraction,\u201d said Jessica Andors, the executive director of Lawrence CommunityWorks, a community development organization that is part of the robust network of nonprofits here.But it was nevertheless on the mind of some of the constituents who approached Mr. Rivera one evening this month. He was outside a grocery store to shake hands and give out his contact information.\u201cI\u2019m thinking, we finally got a decent mayor, and now they want to do this?\u201d said Susan White, 60, who approached Mr. Rivera and shook his hand. \u201cI hope that recall thing just goes away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dialing Back on School Testing", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialCongress made a reasonable decision a decade ago when it required the states to give annual math and reading tests in grades three through eight, and once in high school, in exchange for federal education aid. Schools that failed to meet performance targets for two years were labeled as needing improvement and subjected to sanctions.The Obama administration is rightly urging the states to give fewer tests and to choose exams that are clearly tied to student learning. To that end, Mr. Obama is asking Congress for a total of $403 million to be used by the states to put in place tests that are aligned with college- and career-ready learning standards. In addition, the Department of Education will give the states guidance in how to improve their testing programs.Congress can help to de-emphasize testing by changing how schools are evaluated under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Student test scores should continue to be an important factor, but modest weight should also be given to other indicators, like advanced courses, promotion rates and college matriculation. These common sense measures would help the country dial back the testing mania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders, Democratic Socialist Capitalist", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Road to 2016In last week\u2019s Democratic Party debate, Bernie Sanders stuck up for the idea that Americans are prepared to elect a democratic socialist, which is how he describes himself. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d he said, when the moderator, Anderson Cooper, pressed him on his electability under any kind of socialist label.This led Hillary Rodham Clinton to defend capitalism, saying, \u201cWe would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in history,\u201d though she allowed the need to \u201crein in the excesses of capitalism.\u201dThe weirdest thing about this fight is that Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, is not really a socialist. Or at least, if he is a socialist, he is also, at the same time, a capitalist.Ugh. Do we have to put it that way? In addition to being a mouthful, that still seems as if it\u2019s going to confuse a lot of people.After all, Mr. Sanders does not want to nationalize the steel mills or the auto companies or even the banks. Like Mrs. Clinton, he believes in a mixed economy, where capitalist institutions are mediated through taxes and regulation. He just wants more taxes and more regulation than Mrs. Clinton does. He certainly seems like a regular Democrat, only more so.\u201cIt\u2019s not socialism, it\u2019s social democracy, which is a big difference,\u201d said Mike Konczal, an economic policy expert at the left-wing Roosevelt Institute. Social democracy, Mr. Konczal noted, \u201cimplies a very active role for capitalism in the framework.\u201dSocial democracy, Mr. Sanders will have you remember, is not what they were up to in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It\u2019s the little-of-this, little-of-that philosophy of parties like Labour in Britain or the Social Democrats in Germany. Such parties have abandoned their past support for the nationalization of industry and have presided for long periods over economies that certainly appeared capitalist to visiting American tourists, albeit with higher taxes than we have in the United States.Mr. Konczal laid out four hallmarks. You might be a social democrat if you support: a mixed economy, that is, a combination of private enterprise and government spending; social insurance programs that support the old and the poor; a Keynesian economic policy of government borrowing and spending to offset economic recessions; and democratic participation in government and the workplace.If that\u2019s what social democracy is, it\u2019s not obvious what the term would add to the American political lexicon. Most Democrats would tell you they support all four of those things. So would quite a few Republicans.That said, Mr. Konczal did offer one difference between Mr. Sanders\u2019s and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s worldviews that is of kind rather than degree. This is decommodification: the idea that some goods and services are so important that they ought to be removed from the market economy altogether.The idea behind the Affordable Care Act, and behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach to tinkering with Obamacare, is that quality health insurance should be affordable to everyone, and that people who can\u2019t afford it should be given subsidies to buy it. For a democratic socialist, that\u2019s not good enough; instead, health care should simply be provided to everyone without charge, removing the profit motive from health care.But even this is a matter of degrees. Mr. Sanders favors Medicare for all: a single-payer health care system, with the federal government as the sole insurer. This would remove the profit motive from health insurance but not from health care, which could continue to be provided by private doctors and hospitals, often working on a for-profit basis. Mr. Sanders is not proposing to go further, like Britain, and have doctors work directly for the government. Nor does he appear inclined to decommodify broad swathes of the economy; in other countries, even conservatives often endorse special, less-marketized rules for health care than for other sectors.This distinction is real, but it\u2019s not clear to me that it merits Mr. Sanders his own ideological label. So when Mr. Kenworthy, the California professor, proposed the \u201cdemocratic socialist capitalist\u201d label to me, I responded by asking how that\u2019s different from being a very liberal Democrat.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a difference,\u201d he said. As such, I hope Mr. Sanders is not too offended if I simply describe him as \u201cvery liberal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Carson and Donald Trump Lack Electricity in a Charged Debate", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat a curious, fascinating spectacle: The two men in the lead got lost in the pack.Coming into Wednesday night, much of the talk about the third Republican debate focused on Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who were trading places at the top of the polls, two outsiders with no business running for president and significantly more support from Republican voters than any of the conventional candidates could muster.Which of the two would stand out?Neither.Would either of the two seal the deal?Nope.For the first hour of the debate, which was staged by CNBC, Trump largely disappeared. His rivals and the moderators demonstrated less interest in him than they had in the past, and a Trump without attention is like a petunia without water and light. It fades. It droops.And while that presented a window of opportunity for Carson, he lacked the pep to get through a window or, for that matter, an extremely wide set of sliding doors. His eyelids sometimes went to half-mast as he swayed through an answer, making a sluggish voyage to an uncertain destination.What is it that his supporters see in him?That was John Kasich\u2019s question, or rather his rant, and he started the evening with it, deciding to put all of his few remaining chips on the role of alarmed, truth-telling adult in a sandbox of delusional toddlers.He made specific references to Trump\u2019s promises to deport millions of immigrants and to Carson\u2019s musings about eviscerating entitlement programs. He lambasted various opponents\u2019 proposals for huge tax cuts.\u201cThis stuff is fantasy,\u201d he said, striving so hard for urgency that he practically yelped. \u201cFolks, we gotta wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn\u2019t know how to do the job.\u201dTrump knew full well that Kasich had him in mind, and noted that Kasich hadn\u2019t talked this way months ago.\u201cThen his poll numbers tanked,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.\u201dBefore the debate began, there was some worry\u2014misplaced, as it turns out\u2014that its fiscal focus would create a tame yawner of a night.It did lead to an inordinate amount of chatter about flat taxes and shrunken tax policies and miniaturized tax returns. Carly Fiorina said that she\u2019d collapse the whole tax code to three pages. Ted Cruz said that he\u2019d enable Americans to file their tax returns on postcards.I half expected Rand Paul to one-up them both by pledging to present all of his tax ideas in a single haiku. But he was too busy using his minimal speaking time to complain about his minimal speaking time.Tempers flared. Voices rose. The economy-centered debate on the money-centered network packed ample emotion, in part because it strayed to such issues as gay rights and gun rights and in part because it came at a crucial moment for many of the debaters.More so than during the first or second meeting of these candidates, participants acted as if this was the pivot point that would determine whether they\u2019d be steaming forward or fading out. It was the time for meticulously plotted fury. It was the vessel for the best jokes, rejoinders and soliloquies they had. It was the cause for attack.The defining exchange came early, when Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio banished any memory of their mentor-mentee relationship, which has been obliterated by their head-to-head competition to become level-headed Republicans\u2019 answer to Trump and Carson.Bush slammed Rubio for all the votes he had missed in the Senate as he concentrated on his presidential bid.\u201cWhen you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work,\u201d Bush admonished him. \u201cI mean, literally, the Senate\u2014what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up?\u201dHe sharpened the dagger by addressing Rubio not as \u201cSenator\u201d but as \u201cMarco.\u201dIt was an attempt to make Rubio look small.Then Rubio made him look even smaller, saying Bush was going after him only because \u201csomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\u201d Translation: Your desperation is showing.It was, and Bush\u2019s performance on Wednesday night won\u2019t rescue him from it.Rubio fared much better, keeping his cool in the face of questions meant to rattle him and put him on the defensive. Earlier and better than others on the stage, he turned criticism of him into an indictment of journalists, whom he said were biased against conservatives.He hit his longest, strongest stride when he combined that indictment with a slap at Hillary Clinton. He said that while most reporters, evaluating her recent testimony before a House committee about Benghazi, said she\u2019d emerged triumphant, \u201cIt was the week that she got exposed as a liar. But she has her super PAC helping her out: the American mainstream media.\u201dTed Cruz, too, went after the media, singling out CNBC\u2019s debate moderators. And Cruz, too, stood out, despite (or because of?) one of the most tortured metaphors of any debate of the season so far.Attempting to dismiss the distaste that most of his Congressional colleagues feel for him, he spoke of cars and carbohydrates.\u201cIf you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.\u201d He left out the part where you bolt out of the passenger seat and away from him the minute your front door is in sight.There was amity amid the acrimony, especially on the self-flattering subject of how transcendently wonderful the field of potential Republican nominees is in comparison with the field of potential Democratic nominees.\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of weakness on this stage,\u201d said Chris Christie, whose limited vision apparently didn\u2019t extend to the central lecterns at which Trump and Carson stood. \u201cWhere I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can\u2019t figure out which one is which.\u201dChristie was vivid and forceful, but when it comes to self-congratulation, Trump always reigns supreme, and he roused himself at the end of the night to compliment himself for negotiating a debate of only two hours.It wasn\u2019t clear that he really deserved the credit.

{"Headline": "The Myth\u00ad of Putin\u2019s Strategic Genius", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 THE Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, continues to surprise. Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria, followed by a face-to-face meeting in Moscow this week with that country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, has startled the world.As there was after Mr. Putin\u2019s action in Ukraine last year, there has been a chorus of commentary on his supposed strategic genius. He is acting decisively, seizing the initiative and creating facts on the ground \u2014 so the narrative goes, in contrast with the West\u2019s feckless pursuits in Syria.The opposite is true.Five years ago, Russia was in a much stronger position, both at home and in the world. Today, Mr. Putin is playing defense, doubling down on bad decisions guided by an outdated theory of international politics.Recognition of Russia\u2019s mistakes, however, does not guarantee future failure. The United States and our allies cannot stand idly by and wait for Russia to fail. Instead, we must adopt a comprehensive strategy to minimize the negative consequences of Russia\u2019s actions and maximize the positive ones of ours.Five years ago, Russia was on the move in the world. In 2010 in Ukraine, the Kremlin helped install its ally, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Elsewhere in the former Soviet space, Russia\u2019s leaders were making progress on what would become the Eurasian Economic Union, their answer to the European Union.Moscow had also improved relations with Europe and the United States. President Dmitri A. Medvedev even attended NATO\u2019s Lisbon summit meeting in 2010 and spoke of developing \u201ca strategic partnership\u201d that would put \u201cthe difficult period in our relations behind us now.\u201d The main topic was cooperation on missile defense, not NATO expansion.The Russian economy was returning to growth after the 2008 financial crisis. Trade with the United States was expanding, there were closer ties with European economies, and Russia was on track to join the World Trade Organization.In 2010, Russia also played an essential role in securing new sanctions against Iran. In doing so, it demonstrated bold international leadership even at the price of straining relations with an important ally.And then, in 2011, the people started getting in the way.Mr. Putin, however, had an opposite approach. He believed that behind these protesters was an American hand, and that the response to them \u2014 whether in Syria, Egypt, Russia or Ukraine \u2014 should be coercion and force.After his inauguration as president, Mr. Putin pivoted hard against Russia\u2019s demonstrators, labeling them traitors. His tactics derailed the opposition\u2019s momentum.But his short-term successes have produced long-term costs. Mr. Putin\u2019s paranoia about independent political actors nurtured a growing fear of business interests outside his oligarchical clique. Economic reform stalled, investment declined and state ownership grew.In Ukraine, though, the crackdown on protesters failed. By the time Mr. Yanukovych tried to clear the streets by force, as the Kremlin advocated, his halfhearted attempt at strongman tactics backfired, compelling him to flee.Angered by what he saw as another C.I.A. operation to overthrow a Russian ally, Mr. Putin struck back: He annexed Crimea and attempted an even bigger land grab in eastern Ukraine, called Novorossiya by expansion enthusiasts.Again, the costs of these brief gains piled up. As a result of sanctions and falling energy prices, the Russian economy has shrunk to $1.2 trillion from $2 trillion in 2014. And NATO, once an alliance in search of a mission, is now focused again on deterring Russia.Mr. Putin has also been compelled to abandon the Novorossiya project: His proxies in eastern Ukraine neither enjoy popular support nor run an effective government. And his actions have guaranteed that Ukraine will never join his Eurasian Economic Union or line up with Russia again.His policy toward another ally, Mr. Assad, has failed, too. Despite blocking Security Council resolutions against Mr. Assad\u2019s government, providing weapons to Damascus and encouraging Syria\u2019s allies to come to the regime\u2019s defense, Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts have done little to strengthen Mr. Assad\u2019s rule. After four years of civil war, Mr. Assad governs less territory and faces more formidable foes. That\u2019s why Mr. Putin had to intervene \u2014 to save his autocratic ally from defeat.In the short term, Russia\u2019s Syrian bombing campaign has energized the Syrian Army and its allies to launch a counteroffensive against opposition rebels \u2014 that is, against everyone except the Islamic State. But in the long run, Russian airstrikes alone cannot restore Mr. Assad\u2019s authority over the whole country.Mr. Putin is adept at short-term tactical responses to setbacks, but less talented at long-term strategy. Even with no response from the West, Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign adventures will finally fail, especially as domestic economic problems continue to fester.But the United States and its allies should seek to shorten that time by pushing back against Russia on multiple fronts. As Mr. Putin goes all in to prop up his ally in Syria, we should do the same with our partners and allies \u2014 not only in Syria, but in Europe and around the world.In Syria, the United States cannot allow Russia to eliminate all actors except Mr. Assad and the Islamic State. We must provide more arms and support to other rebel groups. We should warn Mr. Putin that further attacks against non-Islamic State rebels will compel us to protect them, either by enforcing a no-fly zone or by arming them with antiaircraft weapons.The United States and Western allies should capitalize on Mr. Putin\u2019s attention being diverted to Syria to deepen support for Ukraine. In return for progress on economic reform, especially anti-corruption measures, we can offer greater financial aid for infrastructure and social service programs. And now is the moment to bolster the Ukrainian Army by providing more military training and defensive weapons.Elsewhere in Europe, NATO should station ground forces on the territory of allies most threatened by Russia. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine violated the NATO-Russia Founding Act and other treaties. In response, our NATO allies deserve credible new commitments from us.Finally, we must continue to pursue long-term foreign policy objectives that demonstrate American leadership and underscore Russia\u2019s isolation. Ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, closing a multilateral climate deal by the end of the year, deepening ties with India and managing relations with China are all parts of America\u2019s grander strategy.The United States clearly has an interest in the emergence of a strong, rich and democratic Russia, fully integrated into the international community of states. Eventually, new Russian leaders also may realize that Russia\u2019s path to greatness requires reform at home and responsible leadership abroad. Propping up failing dictators through the use of force is not grand strategy.Right now, though, the only way to nudge Russia in a different direction is to contain and push back on Mr. Putin\u2019s current course, not only by our immediate response in Syria, but in a sustained, strategic manner around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Test Scores Under Common Core Show That \u2018Proficient\u2019 Varies by State", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Ohio seems to have taken a page from Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average.It all came down to the different labels each state used to describe the exact same scores on the same tests.\u201cThis was exactly the problem that a lot of policy makers and educators were trying to solve,\u201d said Karen Nussle, the executive director of the Collaborative for Student Success, a Common Core advocacy group, \u201cto get a more honest assessment of where kids are and being transparent about that with parents and educators so that we could do something about it.\u201dThe Common Core was devised by experts convened by state education commissioners and governors to set uniform benchmarks for learning. But as it has been put into place, it has faced increasing backlash, both from politicians, who argue that it infringes on states\u2019 independence to determine education policy, and from parents and teachers, who object to the more stringent testing that has come with the new guidelines.But as the results from the first Common Core tests have rolled out, education officials again seem to be subtly broadening definitions of success.\u201cThat mentality of saying let\u2019s set proficient at a level where not too many people fail is going to kill us,\u201d said Marc S. Tucker, the president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit think tank. \u201cThe global standard of what proficient is keeps moving up.\u201dThose in the middle range, the Parcc group decided, had \u201capproached expectations.\u201d But in Ohio, students who scored in that range were labeled \u201cproficient.\u201d Ohio\u2019s results are based on students \u2014 about two-thirds of the total \u2014 who took the exams online. Results for students who took the test on paper have not yet been released, but will be scored using the same performance levels.Some teachers see the state\u2019s presentation as misleading. \u201cThey shot themselves in the foot by putting it that way,\u201d Kathryne Roston, a fourth-grade teacher at West Broad Elementary School here, said upon seeing how Ohio categorized the test results. \u201cIf you look up \u2018proficient\u2019 in the dictionary, what does that mean? Does it mean what they are making it mean?\u201dOfficials say their hands were tied by state law. James Wright, the director of the Ohio Department of Education\u2019s Office of Curriculum and Assessment, said the legislature requires the department to designate five performance levels on the standardized tests, with Level 3 labeled \u201cproficient.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been very transparent about which levels we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Mr. Wright said.He added that parents or teachers can easily look up what proportion of students in the state scored at each of the Parcc levels.\u201cIt may be a little too premature to declare it a failure,\u201d said James A. Peyser, the secretary of education in Massachusetts, where the State Board of Education will vote in November on whether to use the Parcc tests, \u201cbut for sure it\u2019s in retreat.\u201dMore confusion is to come. Over the summer, the Ohio legislature voted to abandon the Parcc test and commission a new test developer to devise yet another set of exams. Three other states similarly scrapped the Parcc test after administering it this year, creating an increasingly atomized landscape across the country.Parents and educators are still complaining about the increased difficulty of the tests, which demand more writing and complex problem solving than earlier exams, causing scores to drop. In New York, which first rolled out Common Core tests three years ago, a precipitous decline in pass rates set off protests.Adrienne Dawson, a home health nurse whose 12-year-old son, Adrian Tucker, is in seventh grade at Berwick Alternative K-8 School on the east side of Columbus, said she was daunted by the complexity of sample questions she looked at last spring. \u201cIt was a Ph.D. test if you ask me,\u201d she said on a recent morning after she had dropped Adrian off for class.Despite the pushback, teachers here continue to infuse their lessons with Common Core principles.Her teaching methods were more creative than the dry standard suggested. Cordoning off a large space in the middle of the classroom with yellow caution tape, she had faked a crime scene, strewing dirt and gravel from the school garden across a large piece of butcher paper on which she had drawn outlines of two bodies and stamped footprints of shoes dipped in red paint.Ms. James urged the students to analyze the clues and come up with possible victims, suspects and motives for an ultimate assignment of writing a narrative about the crime.She was not too concerned how the assignment would affect test performance. In 10 years of teaching, she said, tests changed and policies came and went. The Common Core could \u201cgo away tomorrow,\u201d she said.\u201cBut does it make a difference in terms of whether I have a crime scene in my classroom?\u201d she added. \u201cThere will always be a crime scene in my classroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Seen as Unlikely to Raise Rates, as Pressures Mount From Both Sides ", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Fed is widely expected to announce that it will continue for now to hold its benchmark rate near zero. The case for liftoff has weakened since the summer. The rest of the world is struggling and there are worrying signs of slower domestic growth.But Fed officials are unlikely to rule out an increase at their final meeting of the year, in December, in part because they are still waiting to see whether economic growth weakened in recent months, and in part because they want to start raising rates early so they can raise them slowly.\u201cAn advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases,\u201d the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress this summer. She explained that moving slowly was prudent, while moving more quickly might be disruptive.Early does mean, however, that the Fed eventually plans to curtail its stimulus campaign even if the economy might still benefit from a little more help. By holding rates near zero since December 2008, the Fed has encouraged borrowing and risk-taking, stimulating economic activity that has helped to increase job growth. Raising rates will begin to weigh on the pace of growth.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Monetary policy makers and academics have long debated the value of moving early and slowly.Central banks, including the Fed, typically raise and lower rates in small steps, at regular intervals, over long periods of time. The Fed, for example, raised rates by exactly 0.25 percentage point at each of its scheduled meetings from June 2004 to June 2006.The result is that monetary policy often changes more slowly than economic conditions, particularly during periods of turbulence, opening a gap between the actual level of interest rates and the level recommended by economic theories and policy rules.Policy makers often cite uncertainty as the most obvious justification for these lags.Policy makers also have an aversion to disrupting financial markets. Fed officials cited market volatility as a reason they decided not to raise rates in September.Mr. Rosengren noted that academic models tend to assume markets adjust rationally and smoothly to changes in Fed policy. History tells a different story, and Mr. Rosengren said there was particular reason for caution in raising rates from near zero for the first time since December 2008.\u201cParticularly after being at the zero lower bound for a long time, I think moving in large discrete amounts would be a risky strategy,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.Other academics argue the Fed should cultivate a higher tolerance for market volatility. Jeremy Stein, a Harvard economist and former Fed governor, wrote in a June paper that moving slowly to maintain market calm was often ineffective because investors assume that the central bank eventually will need to compensate by raising rates more quickly. \u201cSociety would be better off appointing a central banker who cares less about the bond market,\u201d he wrote.Central bankers also like to move slowly because they prize predictability. The Fed, like other central banks, increasingly has focused on managing expectations about the evolution of interest rates, because those expectations shape borrowing and investment decisions. People do not just care about the level of rates right now; they also care where rates are likely to be next year.And moving slowly reduces the chances the Fed would need to reverse course abruptly. The focus on the longer term also lets the Fed exert significant influence on economic conditions without adjusting current rates sharply, by shifting expectations about future rates.\u201cWhat matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-term interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in September.Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist and a former Fed governor, has sat on both sides of the divide between academics and practitioners of monetary policy. He said there was theoretically a clear case for the Fed to wait until tangible signs of inflationary pressure emerge. Practically, however, he said the Fed might need to raise rates before then, at least once, just to demonstrate to investors that it is willing and able to do so.\u201cFrom a pure monetary policy viewpoint, it\u2019s completely reasonable for the Fed to keep rates at zero and not move for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one of the problems that Janet faces is that people in the markets think that she\u2019s very dovish and that she won\u2019t do the hard things she needs to when inflation goes up. So there\u2019s a perception issue that the Fed will never pull the trigger.\u201d He added, however, that he saw little reason to do it in December.Mr. Mishkin said the Fed should abandon its earlier predictions and wait. \u201cIf they did move by the end of this year,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s an indication that they really are focused on dates rather than data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cadillac Tax: Why Economists, but Few Others, Love It", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHealth PolicyThe so-called Cadillac tax is one of those rare taxes whose primary purpose is not to raise revenue. The tax, which is scheduled to begin hitting very-high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans in 2018, was included in the Affordable Care Act to discourage companies from offering such plans.As economists say, \u201cTax something and get less of it.\u201d This is appealing to those who would like to control health care spending, which ultra-comprehensive health plans tend to encourage more of. But it\u2019s not very appealing to people who have the plans, many of them members of unions that fought hard to get the plans in the first place.But the revenue effects of the Cadillac tax are minor compared with the tax\u2019s much larger effects on health care spending. It would be harder for Mrs. Clinton to replicate those cost-control benefits than to replicate the revenues.The tax is expected to cut health care costs in two ways. First, it would encourage employers to give their employees less generous health benefits and instead pay them more in cash. Second, a reduction in free-spending health plans would reduce the overall demand for health care services, making it harder for doctors and hospitals to raise prices. As a result, the tax is expected to reduce the cost of care even for people whose health plans do not change because of the tax.The tax would push against another public policy that encourages people to spend more on health care than they otherwise might: the longstanding exemption of employee health benefits from both income and payroll taxes. Tax exemptions for health spending cost the federal government $300 billion a year, nearly as much as the federal government spends on Medicaid. The Cadillac tax would effectively shrink those income and payroll tax breaks, but only to the extent that a health plan\u2019s premium exceeds a high price cap, about 50 percent higher than the cost of the average plan.While the tax would be paid by health insurers, economists expect insurers to pass the cost of the tax through to employers who buy their plans, who would in turn pass the cost through to employees as lower wages. Because the threshold at which the tax is imposed is quite high, few people would be affected by the tax initially \u2014 whether because their plans would be taxed or because their employers would choose to change plans to avoid the tax. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center finds just 6 percent of households would be affected either way in the first year of the tax.Over time, if health insurance premiums continued to rise faster than inflation, more plans would pass over the Cadillac tax threshold. The exact share of plans affected would depend greatly on the path of health care inflation \u2014 and the tax itself would be one of the key tools aiming to contain that inflation.The reduction in health care costs due to the Cadillac tax would also flow back, in significant part, as lower government spending on health care. Medicare and Medicaid would benefit from a lower price environment, and it would be less expensive to subsidize private health plans brought though the A.C.A. exchanges. That is, if retained, the tax will help contain costs on the spending side of the federal budget, in addition to providing $87 billion of revenue through 2025.Even if Mrs. Clinton finds a new source for the revenues the Cadillac Tax was supposed to generate, it\u2019s not clear what she would to do provide the cost discipline that\u2019s expected to flow from the tax, though her campaign says she is focused on the issue.\u201cHillary Clinton strongly supports the goal of aggressively bending the cost curve,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. \u201cIn the weeks ahead she will be presenting her ideas to continue to exert downward pressure on systemwide health expenditures, but in doing so she will be deliberate about ensuring that we are truly holding down costs, and not just shifting them to middle-class households in the form of higher premiums.\u201dSome people would indeed face higher premiums as a result of the tax, because the tax would effectively get built into the cost of the highest-cost employer-provided plans. But Peter Orszag, a proponent of the tax who served as President Obama\u2019s budget director when the law was signed, rejected the idea that the Cadillac tax is \u201cjust\u201d cost-shifting, saying employers and insurers would be motivated by the tax to find more cost-effective ways to provide care.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to succeed over the long term if all you\u2019re doing is shifting the laundry from under the bed into the closet,\u201d he said. \u201cA far more promising path is to recognize that costs are very concentrated in a small number of beneficiaries.\u201dWhile the Clinton campaign statement focused on the issue of premiums for plans subject to the tax, some Cadillac tax opponents have also worried about what employers will do to get plan premiums below the tax threshold. They could, for example, raise co-payments and deductibles, shifting costs toward beneficiaries.Mr. Orszag argued that cost-shifting changes like that would be \u201csecondary or tertiary,\u201d and that employers seeking to keep their health plan costs below the Cadillac tax threshold would have to focus most on managing costs for the sickest beneficiaries, whose behavior isn\u2019t even influenced by co-payments or deductibles, since their health spending exceeds their plans\u2019 out-of-pocket spending caps. To reduce the cost of caring for these patients, he said insurers would need to avoid high-cost, low-value care that is currently common.\u201cI don\u2019t see why a beneficiary would want to be put in a high-cost skilled nursing facility that has worse outcomes than an alternative,\u201d he said.Ezekiel Emanuel, a key architect of the health care law, argued that the tax is already having a \u201cpsychological\u201d impact on employers and insurers, motivating them to control expenditures and helping generate several years of the lowest health care cost inflation in decades. He worried that an expectation that the tax would be repealed would encourage health costs to rise.A White House spokeswoman also defended the tax, saying a repeal \u201cwould hurt our economy by increasing the deficit, raising health care cost growth, and cutting workers\u2019 paychecks.\u201d While people often think of their wages and health benefits as separate issues, economists are generally convinced that the two trade off against each other directly, and that a faster pace of health care inflation would dampen wage growth.Republicans have been long been seeking to repeal Obamacare, wholesale if possible or piece-by-piece if necessary. While Democrats have generally defended the law, there are key Democratic constituencies that hate the Cadillac tax, especially labor unions, which have often negotiated very hard to obtain the sort of high-cost health plans the tax seeks to discourage.Perhaps most important, the tax sounds punitive. We don\u2019t impose a 40 percent excise tax on expensive cars or expensive hobbies in an effort to control consumption. (Of course, we don\u2019t generally let companies pay their employees in tax-free cars either.)\u201cAs a policy matter it\u2019s very important to keep health care costs under control,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone benefits from that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Russia has deployed military equipment, such as ground-to-air missiles and interceptor jets, that has no use against militant groups that do not have an air force. This made clear that Russia\u2019s priority is to buck up Mr. Assad, and it has raised concerns that if a no-fly zone or safe zone were established, as Turkey has pushed for, it could be challenged by Russia.\u201cThe Russian presence has changed the entire parameters in Syria, including a safe zone,\u201d said Mensur Akgun, director of the Global Political Trends Center, a research organization in Turkey. \u201cNo one will dare confront Russia.\u201dThe Russians pushed back on Tuesday against objections that their military actions in Syria are not targeting the Islamic State. Maria V. Zakharova, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Moscow, said news media organizations that report such objections are part of what she called an anti-Russian misinformation campaign.Syrian fighters are in a continual state of churn, she said, alternatively forming alliances and fighting one another, and Russia will not make distinctions between the various groups she described as terrorists. \u201cIf they talk like a terrorist, if they fight like a terrorist, if they act like a terrorist, they are a terrorist,\u201d she said, paraphrasing what Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov said at the outset of the campaign last week.The new tensions between Russia and Turkey over Syria have highlighted a deeply complex relationship between the two countries. In some ways Turkey\u2019s relationship with Russia is similar to its relationship with Iran, the Syrian government\u2019s most important regional ally. In its dealings with each country, Turkey is able to separate sharp differences over issues like the war in Syria with deepening economic ties, not to mention a robust tourism industry between the two countries.On the same visit, Mr. Erdogan also promoted Turkey\u2019s economic relationship with Russia. He said that bilateral trade had reached $31 billion last year, and that Turkey\u2019s goal was for that figure to hit $100 billion by 2023. \u201cLet us hope that fortune is on our side and that we will succeed in reaching this objective,\u201d he said.Turkey\u2019s relationship with Russia is also deeply clouded by history. Analysts have written of the fear of Russian ambitions that infect the Turkish psyche and are rooted in the history of the many wars \u2014 at least 17 by one count \u2014 fought between the Ottoman Empire and Russia over centuries.\u201cConsequently,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay wrote, \u201cTurkey is unlikely to confront Moscow even when Russia undermines Turkey\u2019s interests, such as in Syria where Russia is supporting the Assad regime, even as Ankara tries to depose it.\u201dWhat is clear, though, is that Russia is willing to confront Turkey. By violating Turkey\u2019s airspace twice in recent days \u2014 not a mistake, as Russia said, but a deliberate move, according to NATO \u2014 Russia seemed intent on warning any of Mr. Assad\u2019s foes not to violate Syrian sovereignty.NATO, whose officials have been critical of Turkey in recent years for not doing enough to crack down on jihadist fighters crossing its border to fight in Syria, objected to the Russian incursion, and Turkey scrambled its own warplanes to intercept the Russian planes. In statements, Turkish officials hinted that if it happened again it might shoot down any Russian jets that cross its airspace.Yet those warnings not withstanding Turkey, because of history and its deep economic links to Russia, \u201cwill try its utmost to avoid any type of confrontation with the Russians,\u201d Mr. Akgun said.An earlier version of this article omitted a word from a comment by Mensur Akgun. He said Turkey \u201cwill try its utmost to avoid any type of confrontation with the Russians.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Andrew E.

It is also their form. The writers\u2019 decisions about how to construct sentences, about what the subject of the sentence will be, about whether the verb will be active or passive, shape the message that slavery was not all that bad.I teach freshman writing at Dartmouth College. My colleagues and I consistently try to convey to our students the importance of clear writing. Among the guiding principles of clear writing are these: Whenever possible, use human subjects, not abstract nouns; use active verbs, not passive. We don\u2019t want our students to write, \u201cTorture was used,\u201d because that sentence obscures who was torturing whom.In the excerpts published by Jezebel, the Texas textbooks employ all the principles of good, strong, clear writing when talking about the \u201cupside\u201d of slavery. But when writing about the brutality of slavery, the writers use all the tricks of obfuscation. You can see all this at play in the following passage from a textbook, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, called Texas United States History:Some slaves reported that their masters treated them kindly. To protect their investment, some slaveholders provided adequate food and clothing for their slaves. However, severe treatment was very common. Whippings, brandings, and even worse torture were all part of American slavery.Notice how in the first two sentences, the \u201cslavery wasn\u2019t that bad\u201d sentences, the main subject of each clause is a person: slaves, masters, slaveholders. What those people, especially the slave owners, are doing is clear: They are treating their slaves kindly; they are providing adequate food and clothing. But after those two sentences there is a change, not just in the writers\u2019 outlook on slavery but also in their sentence construction. There are no people in the last two sentences, only nouns. Yes, there is severe treatment, whippings, brandings and torture. And yes, those are all bad things. But where are the slave owners who were actually doing the whipping and branding and torturing? And where are the slaves who were whipped, branded and tortured? They are nowhere to be found in the sentence.Note the use of the passive voice in the verbs \u201cwere broken apart\u201d and \u201cwas sold.\u201d If the sentence had been written according to the principles of good draftsmanship, it would have looked like this: Slave owners often broke slave families apart by selling a family member to another owner. A bit more powerful, no? Through grammatical manipulation, the textbook authors obscure the role of slave owners in the institution of slavery.It may appear at first glance that the authors do a better job of focusing on the actions of slaves. After all, there are many sentences in which \u201cslaves\u201d are the subjects, the main characters in their own narrative. But what are the verbs in those sentences? Are the slaves suffering? No, in the sentences that feature slaves as the subject, as the main actors in the sentence, the slaves are contributing their agricultural knowledge to the growing Southern economy; they are singing songs and telling folk tales; they are expressing themselves through art and dance.There are no sentences, in these excerpts, anyway, in which slaves are doing what slaves actually did: toiling relentlessly, without remuneration or reprieve, constantly subject to confinement, corporal punishment and death.The textbook publishers were put in a difficult position. They had to teach history to Texas\u2019 children without challenging conservative political views that are at odds with history. In doing so, they made many grammatical choices. Though we don\u2019t always recognize it, grammatical choices can be moral choices, and these publishers made the wrong ones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Toyota Highlander Hybrid Offers Room and Fuel Economy", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenVans have more space for people and cargo, but fashion-forward families want crossovers. Taking the hybrid, instead of a gas-only Highlander, to Oregon was a calculated decision. While diesels and hybrids have been the two methods of maximizing fuel economy, prospects have become cloudy for diesel in the United States given the recent revelation that Volkswagen cheated on emissions testing with diesel cars. But I had my doubts about large hybrids. With past-generation Highlanders, I never saw a significant difference in gas mileage between hybrid and gas-only models. The opportunity for a real-world hybrid test was fortuitous.First, some numbers. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the fuel economy of a V6 all-wheel-drive Highlander at 18 city and 24 highway. Hybrid models score 27 city and 28 highway. These numbers are often, shall we say, optimistic. Keep in mind I transported 350 pounds of teenage boys, around 175 pounds of luggage, support gear for the tournament and camera equipment to shoot the video that goes with this review.Averaging around 70 miles an hour to Corvallis, the laden Highlander matched the E.P.A. highway rating of 27 miles per gallon. Early the next morning, I pointed the Highlander toward its natural habitat, the suburbs, to determine city gas mileage. Gingerly driving for 30 minutes around a small development with moderate hills and stop signs, I saw 31 m.p.g. (and a few nervous residents perhaps thinking I was casing their neighborhood). That\u2019s 13 m.p.g. over the V6 Highlander city rating and 3 miles per gallon above the hybrid\u2019s E.P.A. score.Little, if any, space is taken up by the nickel metal hydride battery under the midrow chairs. Like most hybrids, the transmission is continuously variable. All-wheel drive is standard; an electric motor drives the rear wheels.All Highlanders get a good-looking interior, at least in Limited trim. The center console swallows a 15-inch laptop, and the long shelf in the dash is a handy place for necessities (which can make the space look cluttered). Midrow chairs slide fore and aft to show those in back a little love with more legroom. That third row is mounted low to the floor, so passengers\u2019 knees are up high. Adults will avoid those seats on long trips.The Highlander is quiet, comfortable and, to my eye, the best-looking vehicle Toyota produces. Its hybrid system more than lives up to its claims. If only its efficiency was more affordable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sunday Dialogue: The Media Gap", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders discuss a letter from a former CNN correspondent lamenting that as infotainment replaces in-depth news, the public is less well informed.To the Editor:At a time when Americans could benefit from deeper political news coverage in the United States, the media are sliding toward thinner coverage and ever-shorter \u201cnews nuggets\u201d of information. Journalists like me used to bemoan TV\u2019s 20-second sound bites; today, we\u2019re lucky to have even skimpier news morsels in social media to complain about.Despite the proliferation of so-called \u201cnews\u201d channels on TV, audiences for them are declining and people are turning more frequently to skeletal updates they consume quickly on the small screens of their phones and tablets. During many hours of the day, even the news channels are devoting prime-time hours to opinion shows and infotainment about travel, food and sports.Americans are constantly being polled about complex political subjects like the Iran nuclear deal, or relations with Russia or the financial machinations among our closest allies in Europe. None of these subjects are simple. Yet American presidential candidates are responding to them with quips, tweets and photos, and potential voters are learning about them through the news equivalents of those 100-calorie bags of chips and cookies.It\u2019s a terrible diet if the goal is beefing up understanding. And even if we concede that most Americans care more about food, fashion, fame and football than about anything political or international, the result is candidates who get away with simplistic answers and find themselves in office with shallow public support. Democracy depends on an informed electorate choosing capable leaders.News organizations are trimming operations and devoting more time and space to pop culture because it attracts consumers. Very few are investing in more, deeper and better journalism, because readers and viewers don\u2019t choose it.Maybe it\u2019s time to abandon the founders\u2019 unfulfilled vision of a press completely separate from government, and devote a portion of our tax dollars, as the British do, to underwriting thorough, investigative, nonpartisan watchdog journalism.RALPH BEGLEITERNewark, Del.The writer, a former world affairs correspondent for CNN, founded the University of Delaware\u2019s Center for Political Communication.A republic that prefers to be amused more than informed and engaged on the issues that touch its national life, its future and its role in the world is not only \u201camusing ourselves to death,\u201d as the critic and educator Neil Postman once put it, but forfeiting its place of leadership among the community of nations.Our candidates for high office tweet sophomoric insults at one another and yuk it up on late-night talk shows while Syria burns, thousands of refugees pour into Europe, students are gunned down on our campuses and the economy continues to stagnate.Ours is a culture in crisis, yet the Fourth Estate is more committed to its corporate profitability than to its civic responsibility. The news media did not create the current crisis, but they have failed for too long to cover it seriously and chosen instead to profit from the culture of shallow amusement. We have the media and the political leadership we deserve.ROY ALDEN ATWOODWest Frankfort, Ill.I agree that there are serious problems with our news coverage, but I think that the primary problem lies not with thoroughness, as the writer suggests, but more with the manner of presentation. There are still news organizations such as The New York Times and public television that give the reader an extensive diet of news coverage and analysis. But even there the news is presented in entertainment mode, with headline-grabbing emphasis on political wins and losses rather than substance.The entertainment focus, no doubt motivated by the need to increase readership and advertising revenues, is illustrated at its worst by the constant focus on the ups and downs of presidential candidates for a period up to two years before the election. There is an overemphasis on TV debates, which promote form over substance and reward the glib promoter and huckster but punish the candidate who relies upon careful thought and deliberation.In sum, the determined reader able to spend sufficient time can find weighty news in a few journalistic outlets if he or she digs below the headlines, but most readers who must look quickly at bold print and skim or rely exclusively on mainstream or cable TV will be left with the impression that life is mostly a political sports event.HAROLD J. SMITHWhite PlainsThe decline in quality of America\u2019s conversations about the world today, and of our politicians\u2019 attempts to help voters understand the world they would lead us through, both perfectly parallel the decline of America\u2019s broadcast and print news media. Our refusal to deal with the complexity of the challenges we face is ratified by news media bent on speeding up their meaningless news cycles and shortening our attention spans.My reply: \u201cEducation is entertaining.\u201d How I wish more people in today\u2019s television news believed this.DAVE MARASHTijeras, N.M.The writer, a longtime TV news correspondent and anchor, is host of an in-depth news show, \u201cHere and There With Dave Marash,\u201d on KSFR-FM in Santa Fe.Mr. Begleiter is right that far too many Americans get their news from sources that do not encourage them to engage with complex issues. The Internet has had both positive and negative effects with respect to this. On the one hand, a quick Google search can provide easy access to government reports and academic studies, empowering ordinary citizens to dig deeper and check the facts themselves in ways that were previously not feasible. On the other hand, a social networking platform like Twitter, with its 140-character limit, is ideal not for communicating information and ideas but rather for mindlessly expressing emotions and spreading outrage without giving any thought to opposing viewpoints.This mind-set has spread to campaign emails, which often consist of incendiary (and sometimes factually questionable) one-liners intended to spur anger against the opposing candidate that can be translated into donations.It seems unlikely that establishing an official government-run news source would solve this problem. Even if it was successful at providing thorough and balanced coverage, citizens could simply choose not to consume it. The solution needs to come from the American people demanding better from the media and politicians. I\u2019ll seriously consider voting for any candidate \u2014 Democratic or Republican \u2014 who has the guts to just say no to tweeting and conducts a campaign based on serious proposals to address the issues facing our nation.DAVID GOLUBNew YorkMr. Begleiter is right to note that as \u201cnews\u201d becomes ever more compressed and trivialized, candidates for public office respond to the degraded media environment by further compressing and trivializing their own take on complex issues. It\u2019s a depressing downward spiral.PETER LAARMANLos AngelesEverything Mr. Begleiter says about the state of American journalism is true, yet the only thing worse than what we have now would be his suggestion of using tax dollars to create \u201cthorough, investigative, nonpartisan watchdog journalism.\u201d It can\u2019t be done.News organizations are inherently biased, no matter where their money comes from. Even if public funding removed the market pressures, journalists would still pick and choose what to cover and how to cover it based on their political and social beliefs. If it were actually possible to create news organizations that were always properly balanced and focused, we could just use the same money to recruit and train ideal politicians in the first place. I tell you it can\u2019t be done.As the novelist Henry James observed, \u201cIt takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature.\u201d It also takes a great deal of journalism to produce a little news. Because there is no infallible news source, one has to sift many imperfect sources. It would be very dangerous to set up a news organization with government backing and label it as the premier source. Like it or not, we\u2019re better off with the food fight we have.MARK R. GODBURNNorth Canaan, Conn.Mr. Begleiter is on target in his assertion that \u201cdemocracy depends on an informed electorate choosing capable leaders.\u201d However, his notion of government-funded \u201cnonpartisan watchdog journalism\u201d is wishful thinking. Mr. Begleiter seems to think that the problem is in the nature or quality of the media.Blaming the media for the simplistic and shallow quality of our political discourse is like blaming the messenger. It is up to the citizenry to become well informed about complex issues, and ubiquitous technology makes such information readily available. The solution is not in deeper political news coverage, but in a better educated public.LARRY HOFFNERNew YorkI couldn\u2019t agree more with Mr. Begleiter\u2019s sentiments. I feel fortunate to live now in Australia, where the publicly funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation provides a feast of intelligent radio and television content, from news, documentaries and discussion to comedy, drama and film. In Sydney alone I can listen to five commercial-free radio stations offering 24-hour news, classical music and more.I strongly believe that the public here is far better educated and informed as a result. There is far less of the \u201cdivisive journalism\u201d (such as Fox \u201cNews\u201d) here. What passes for \u201cnews\u201d in the United States is really comment and (uninformed) opinion.KIM HOGGARDSydney, AustraliaThe writer was an assistant press secretary under President Ronald Reagan.Readers are certainly correct when they warn that establishing a publicly funded news organization is fraught with challenges. And I agree with Mr. Smith, Mr. Hoffner and Mr. Golub that our citizens have a responsibility to work at keeping themselves well informed. I\u2019m not so sure that a public-funded news organization must necessarily be an \u201cofficial\u201d government operation. As Mr. Laarman notes, there are other ways to support \u201cnational centers of good journalism,\u201d as Britain, Australia and a few others do.My biggest fear is that market forces, cited by several readers, are driving traditional and even so-called \u201cnew\u201d media toward business models that simply won\u2019t support good journalism or an informed public.Like many Americans, Mr. Atwood assumes that news organizations have some kind of \u201ccivic responsibility.\u201d But market-driven corporations, which today own most of America\u2019s news operations, have no such responsibility; it\u2019s easy for their nonjournalist managements to leave the mission of informing the public to someone else. CBS infamously broadcast a football game instead of a presidential impeachment vote in 1998, tarnishing its decades-long mantle as one of the nation\u2019s most respected sources of public affairs information.Only a handful of American news organizations still employ professional staffs to travel widely, report independently, and write and edit knowledgeably about public affairs. The rest, especially social and solely online media, are mere aggregators of the work of those few. If market forces prevail, the aggregators won\u2019t have any sources to cite, and no one will be supporting much more than scooping up photos, video and contributions of untrained citizen \u201cjournalists.\u201dI especially enjoyed the sarcasm of a Facebook writer who posted in response to my initial letter: \u201cTl;dr\u201d (social media acronym for \u201cToo long; didn\u2019t read\u201d).RALPH BEGLEITERNewark, Del.Because of editing errors, an earlier version of Dave Marash\u2019s letter misstated the dateline of the letter and the name of his news program. He wrote the letter in Tijeras, N.M., not Sante Fe; his show is \u201cHere and There With Dave Marash,\u201d not \u201cHere and Now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jeb justifies his plan by claiming that it would double America\u2019s rate of growth; The Donald, ahem, trumps this by claiming that he would triple the rate of growth. But really, why sweat the details? It\u2019s all voodoo. The interesting question is why every Republican candidate feels compelled to go down this path.You might think that there was a defensible economic case for the obsession with cutting taxes on the rich. That is, you might think that if you\u2019d spent the past 20 years in a cave (or a conservative think tank). Otherwise, you\u2019d be aware that tax-cut enthusiasts have a remarkable track record: They\u2019ve been wrong about everything, year after year.Undaunted, the same people predicted great things as a result of George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts. What happened instead was a sluggish recovery followed by a catastrophic economic crash.Most recently, the usual suspects once again predicted doom in 2013, when taxes on the 1 percent rose sharply due to the expiration of some of the Bush tax cuts and new taxes that help pay for health reform. What happened instead was job growth at rates not seen since the 1990s.So every Republican who would be president is committed to a policy that is both demonstrably bad economics and deeply unpopular. What\u2019s going on?In other words, it\u2019s straightforward and quite stark: Republicans support big tax cuts for the wealthy because that\u2019s what wealthy donors want. No doubt most of those donors have managed to convince themselves that what\u2019s good for them is good for America. But at root it\u2019s about rich people supporting politicians who will make them richer. Everything else is just rationalization.Of course, once the Republicans settle on a nominee, an army of hired guns will be mobilized to obscure this stark truth.

{"Headline": "Ex-Company Man Key to Mine Disaster Prosecution", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Christopher L. Blanchard was a company man for years, so loyal and well regarded that he was entrusted to oversee the Upper Big Branch mine, one of the most productive and lucrative prongs of the Massey Energy Company\u2019s coal empire. And after the fiery disaster at the mine that killed 29 workers in April 2010, he long refused to speak to investigators about the event. But on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Blanchard appeared in a federal courtroom as a key witness for the government in an event whose very existence still surprises people here: the trial of Donald L. Blankenship, Massey\u2019s former chief executive and a coal baron who once held extraordinary sway over this state\u2019s economy and politics. Mr. Blankenship, 65, is facing a possible sentence of decades in prison as he battles charges that include conspiring to breach mine safety standards and deceiving federal regulators.Shielded from prosecution under an immunity agreement, Mr. Blanchard began to explain Massey\u2019s inner machinations, including how, he said, Mr. Blankenship exerted wide influence over a sprawling corporation with billions of dollars in revenue, and how the company sometimes demonstrated a casual approach to safety.\u201cGiven lower production constraints and more staff, a majority of violations could have been prevented,\u201d said Mr. Blanchard, who was the president of the Massey subsidiary that operated Upper Big Branch and, in 2010, was expected to be responsible for about 15 percent of its parent company\u2019s revenue. Mr. Blanchard also described an illegal strategy to alert miners when federal regulators arrived for surprise inspections. Mr. Blanchard, asked whether he knew such conduct was prohibited, said, \u201cI know what Section 103(a) of the Mine Act said.\u201dBut Mr. Blanchard did not begin to delve into the events of April 5, 2010, when Upper Big Branch became the site of the country\u2019s deadliest mining accident in 40 years. A state-commissioned investigation concluded, in part, that Massey had not properly ventilated Upper Big Branch, which allowed combustible gases to build and explode.Critics have argued that Mr. Blankenship, who helped transform Massey into a coal industry titan, broke the law while he cultivated a corporate culture that they contend valued money more than lives. The trial is among the most significant in the modern history of West Virginia; the United States attorney here, R. Booth Goodwin II, is among the lawyers participating.If prosecutors like Mr. Goodwin are to prove their case against Mr. Blankenship, observers said, Mr. Blanchard\u2019s turn on the witness stand could be pivotal, because few others had as much knowledge as Mr. Blanchard about Upper Big Branch\u2019s operations and Mr. Blankenship\u2019s demands. Mr. Blanchard had deep experience with Massey before he left in the wake of the disaster: He joined a precursor of the company upon his graduation from Virginia Tech.Much of the first hours of Mr. Blanchard\u2019s testimony, which is scheduled to continue Friday, amounted to explanations of industry parlance, mining techniques and, perhaps most critical to the prosecution\u2019s case, Mr. Blankenship\u2019s approach to management.Echoing earlier testimony from his administrative assistant, Mr. Blanchard spoke of how Mr. Blankenship received reports from Upper Big Branch every 30 minutes, including nights and weekends, when they were faxed to his home. He talked of an instance when Mr. Blankenship was asked to approve an expense of $750, and another time when Mr. Blanchard sought to raise the pay of truck drivers by $1.91 an hour; that proposed change, too, went before the chief executive.Mr. Blanchard and his assistant, Lisa Williams, also described how the man sometimes known as \u201cthe Chairman\u201d could be a condescending, unforgiving executive. Ms. Williams, who often heard parts of phone calls between the men, said that Mr. Blanchard sometimes appeared \u201cdefeated\u201d and \u201cwhipped\u201d after conversations with Mr. Blankenship.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s defense team has not yet questioned Mr. Blanchard. On Thursday, a defense lawyer, William W. Taylor III, made frequent objections to the questions the prosecution posed to Mr. Blanchard.But one prosecutor, Steven R. Ruby, used his questions to shore up the government\u2019s argument that the Massey Energy of Mr. Blankenship\u2019s era was a company of particular callousness.\u201cWas there an understanding at Upper Big Branch that a certain level of safety violations that could have been prevented were instead going to be tolerated?\u201d Mr. Ruby asked.Mr. Blanchard, who was mentioned but unnamed in the indictment against Mr. Blankenship, replied, \u201cThere was an understanding that a certain number of safety violations would be written that could have been prevented.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The four Republican candidates who were banished for the third time to an early-evening debate looked like diners at a table in Siberia, straining to make conversation as they looked past one another at what they were missing.

Pataki and Rick Santorum all needed a big moment at Wednesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate to seize voters\u2019 attention in a 15-candidate field.It was unclear if any got that moment, though there were spirited disagreements in a debate focused on the economy and tax policy, and Mr. Graham told several crowd-pleasing one liners, including his remark that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, went \u201cto the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don\u2019t think he ever came back.\u201dMr. Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, had threatened not to show up if CNBC, the sponsor, did not change its rules to allow him onto the main stage. It did not, but he still showed up. Mr. Graham, the senator from South Carolina, pithily described what it meant to be in the undercard event: \u201cIt sucks.\u201d Mr. Pataki, a former governor of New York, who reported $14,000 in his campaign account through September, had one of his most high profile moments in the news since the last debate, when he attracted attention for going bird-watching. At one point, he elbowed into the cross talk between two others on stage with the quip, \u201cYou guys talk over each other in Washington all the time; I\u2019m not used to that.\u201dThere were a couple of jarring moments when the flamboyant personal styles of a pair of CNBC moderators, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, clashed with the seriousness of the evening in rotating through a series of questions.All four candidates face a particular challenge: They are establishment figures in a year when half the party\u2019s voters prefer an outsider with no governing experience. Mr. Jindal established himself as the most fiscally conservative of the quartet, defending a tax plan to slash corporate taxes and make even the poorest workers pay 2 percent in income taxes. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to continue to create one class of Americans that pays for government and another class that is more and more dependent on government,\u201d he said.Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, criticized Mr. Jindal\u2019s tax plan as comparable to one offered by Donald J. Trump, saying both would add trillions to the deficit. Calling himself a \u201cblue-collar conservative\u201d with policies favorable to middle-class workers, Mr. Santorum criticized conservatives opposed to the Export-Import Bank for placing ideology over American jobs. Mr. Graham, who has made his hawkishness the centerpiece of his campaign, sometimes seemed to believe he was at a debate focused on foreign policy. He repeatedly answered questions about the economy by calling for a more muscular national defense. Asked if corporations had a responsibility to be good citizens, he offered a non sequitur answer: that his first job as commander in chief would be \u201cto rebuild the military.\u201d\u201cMake me commander in chief and this crap stops,\u201d Mr. Graham, a senator from South Carolina, said at another point, holding up a fist and an open hand to illustrate the choice voters had for a choice of leader.At one point Mr. Graham was asked if his views were too liberal for the Republican party. He responded that on immigration reform and climate change, he was conservative but a pragmatist. \u201cAt the end of the day, folks, I\u2019m trying to solve problems and win an election,\u201d Mr. Graham said.Mr. Pataki, little known outside New York, sought to establish his tax-cutting credentials. \u201cI\u2019ve cut taxes more than everybody on this stage, more than everybody on the next stage,\u201d he said. Mr. Jindal was repeatedly pressed on his fiscal policies in Louisiana.

Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, is opposed to the bank, and the discharge petition amounts to an end-run around Mr. Hensarling.\u201cAt a time when our Republican conference is divided, this will divide it even further,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSigning a discharge petition \u2014 regardless of the issue \u2014 gives the Democrats control over our agenda. That\u2019s why they are so eager to sign it.\u201dSpeaker John A. Boehner has been viewed as friendly to the bank cause, which has strong support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other American business interests.The bank also has significant backing in the Senate, though Senator Mitch McConnell is personally opposed to renewing the bank. However, he has also acknowledged that the federal agency has majority support, and he is willing to let the legislation through but most likely only as an amendment to other legislation, like a highway bill.The last successful use of a discharge petition was in 2002, when it broke a logjam over campaign finance legislation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea to Hold Convention for Workers\u2019 Party", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, which analysts say has grown more powerful under the country\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, will hold its first full-fledged party congress since 1980 next year, state-run news media reported on Friday.The party\u2019s Politburo said the meeting, to be held in May, was needed to strengthen the party\u2019s role under Mr. Kim\u2019s leadership, according to the report from the official Korean Central News Agency. The report provided no additional details of what would be discussed.Since inheriting the country\u2019s leadership from his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011, Kim Jong-un has tried to cement his control over both the Workers\u2019 Party and the army. His government is struggling to revive a moribund economy while building an arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, despite tough penalties from the United Nations.Outside analysts say that under Mr. Kim, the Workers\u2019 Party has regained some of the powers and prerogatives, including the right to trade in minerals and other goods, that it had ceded to the military under his father, who championed a \u201cmilitary first\u201d policy.\u201cKim Jong-un will likely use the congress to present his new vision for his country and officially declare to his people that his era has arrived,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in the South Korean capital, Seoul. \u201cIt will also signal that the party has finally restored its normal functions after all those \u2018military first\u2019 years.\u201dThe congress, the party\u2019s seventh, will give Mr. Kim an opportunity to enforce \u201cgenerational change\u201d by filling the party\u2019s key posts with younger cadres chosen by himself, Professor Kim said. One function of the party congress is to elect a new Central Committee, which in turn could prompt changes in other crucial party organs like the Politburo, he said.The Workers\u2019 Party holds congresses to review or change important party policies or elect new leaders. The party last held such a congress in 1980, although it called smaller meetings of party representatives in 2010 and 2012.Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman for the Unification Ministry of South Korea, said the government was closely watching the developments.Mr. Jeong also said that the government was monitoring a nuclear test site in the North but could not confirm South Korean news reports that a tunnel was being dug there, possibly in preparation for a nuclear test. One report, from the Yonhap news agency, quoted an unidentified government source as saying that there had been increased activity at the site, but that more analysis was needed to determine whether that signaled an imminent test.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Cameron, at Conservatives\u2019 Conference, Puts His Focus on Political Center", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClosing the Conservatives\u2019 first party convention since their election victory in May, Mr. Cameron returned to ideas he championed when he first won the leadership of his party in 2005, emphasizing a \u201cmodern, compassionate\u201d conservatism that offered help to the destitute and opportunity to those who want to better themselves.He wants his period in power to be remembered as a \u201cdefining decade for our country,\u201d a \u201cturnaround decade,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen people no longer felt the current going against them, but working with them.\u201dMr. Cameron appears to have identified the political center as his for the taking, after an election victory in which the centrist Liberal Democrats, who had been in a coalition with the Conservatives, slumped to just eight seats in Parliament, and after the opposition Labour Party, which lost Scotland and did poorly in England, swung to the left.At the same time, Mr. Cameron is committed, along with his close ally George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, to shrinking the size of the state and continuing austerity measures to cut deeply into government spending, including social welfare programs, to reduce Britain\u2019s large deficit.On security matters, Mr. Cameron took a more traditional Conservative line, talking of further moves to tackle Islamic extremism abroad in the shape of the Islamic State and at home, targeting Muslim religious schools that, in his view, may be preaching intolerance. And he made a vicious attack on the new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, saying, \u201cWe cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathizing, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.\u201dWith Mr. Cameron having said that he will step down as prime minister before the 2020 elections, even before the Conservatives\u2019 resounding victory in May, the meeting in Manchester had been dominated by the attention-grabbing speeches of colleagues already maneuvering for his job.But on Wednesday Mr. Cameron sought to push that to one side, making it plain that he was not without his own political goals and was in no hurry to leave office, telling internal rivals that he was \u201cstarting the second half of my time in this job.\u201dIf Wednesday belonged to Mr. Cameron, Monday and Tuesday were auditions. On Monday, Mr. Osborne, a Cameron favorite, also sought to present the Conservatives as the party of the center, gleefully appropriating policies long associated with the Labour Party. Mr. Osborne proposed building up Britain with new infrastructure designed to spread wealth to the north of the country. Even if he was not sure that his idea of a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d would succeed, he said, it would be worth the effort.On Tuesday, the home secretary, Theresa May, made a pitch for the right of the party, with harsh language about uncontrolled immigration and internal security. \u201cWhen immigration is too high, when the pace of change is too fast, it\u2019s impossible to build a cohesive society,\u201d she said. She argued that immigration had little positive impact on the British economy, a position quickly disputed by some businesspeople and academics.Boris Johnson, the charismatic lawmaker and departing mayor of London, joined the beauty pageant with an appeal to \u201cone nation,\u201d or inclusive, conservatism in a speech that lavishly praised Mr. Cameron while also quietly criticizing him and Mr. Osborne for cutting tax credits to workers on low incomes. Mr. Johnson also kept open the possibility that he could support a British exit from the European Union in a referendum that Mr. Cameron has promised by the end of 2017.His speech was a reminder that despite their parliamentary majority, the Conservatives face their own internal strains, notably on issues including the European Union, immigration, welfare and even whether to build a third runway at the overcrowded Heathrow Airport (which Mr. Johnson loudly opposes).Mr. Cameron\u2019s promise to hold a referendum on British membership in the European Union has heightened passions on a subject that has been divisive for Conservatives since 1990, when the prime minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, was ejected by her own party, partly because of her resistance to European integration.Europe could also be a problem for Mr. Osborne, who has a leading role in renegotiating Britain\u2019s terms of membership in the European Union. Should those talks fail, or voters in the referendum reject membership, his prospects would take a battering.Not so for Mr. Johnson, who once reported from Brussels for The Daily Telegraph as a young and euroskeptic journalist, and who many say would benefit from a no vote. He took a few swipes at the bloc on Tuesday, while arguing that the health of British democracy depended on \u201cgetting the right deal now from our European Union partners, as I know David Cameron can.\u201dHe seemed to be taking aim at Mr. Osborne\u2019s plans to restrict tax credits, which subsidize low earners, changes that are likely to hurt some families on low incomes.\u201cWe must ensure that as we reform welfare and we cut taxes that we protect the hardest-working and lowest-paid: shop workers, cleaners, the people who get up in the small hours or work through the night,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Among the contenders to succeed Mr. Cameron, Mr. Osborne is seen as the man to beat because his stewardship of the economy since 2010 is credited by many with bringing the Conservatives election victory, but he has long struggled to connect with the public.\u201cSomething about his black curls and pale face,\u201d Charles Moore, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph, wrote of Mr. Osborne in 2008, \u201cmake him look like a powdered French aristocrat in 1790 staring affrighted from the window of his carriage as the sans-culottes start trying to turn it over.\u201d More recently, others have likened his new haircut to that of Julius Caesar.Stephen Castle reported from Manchester, and Steven Erlanger from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Development Bank Goes to Court for $400 Million in Taxes", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new front opened in Puerto Rico\u2019s debt battle as the island\u2019s powerful Government Development Bank went to court, seeking $400 million in local property tax revenue it said was being illegally held by a local collection agency.The development bank said the money was crucial to its ability to make coming payments to bondholders.\u201cThrough this illegal action, the CRIM is putting the finances of all municipalities in danger, and likely exposing them to claims from their creditors,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief operating officer, Karolee Garc\u00eda Figueroa, said Wednesday evening.No one returned telephone calls or responded to an email message to the tax collections agency on Thursday.The agency\u2019s website shows that its board is dominated by the mayors of cities on the island, suggesting a majority may have wanted to hold onto the money locally, where it could be used to pay for services to residents, rather than letting the development bank send it to faceless bondholders on the mainland who do not elect local mayors.In a sign of the complicated relationships in the island\u2019s government, the president of the development bank, Melba Acosta Febo, and another official, Jos\u00e9 V. Pag\u00e1n Beauchamp, were listed as members of the collection agency\u2019s board. A spokeswoman for the bank said they were unavailable for comment.As the two agencies prepared to battle in court, Puerto Ricans woke on Thursday to a new 4 percent tax on professional services provided to businesses on the island. The tax is expected to apply to engineering companies, lawyers, accountants and others who have not already been paying a 7 percent tax on business services.While the new tax will not appear on cash register receipts for consumer purchases, economists say Puerto Ricans are bound to feel the effect indirectly as companies pass through the cost to their customers. Months earlier, general sales taxes on the island were increased to 11.5 percent from 7 percent. In protest, truck drivers closed a main thoroughfare leading to the governor\u2019s mansion in San Juan this week.Puerto Rico has been struggling with a total $73 billion in debt, roughly $4.1 billion of which was issued by municipalities. In late June \u2014 three days before the collections agency resolved not to release the $400 million \u2014 Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla announced that a debt of that size was \u201cunpayable.\u201dSince then, officials have been working on a restructuring plan and have begun meeting with creditors. Officials have said they hope to negotiate a debt exchange, which would reduce some of the debt burden while respecting the hierarchy of creditors.The Puerto Rican constitution says general obligation bonds have priority over all other government payments \u2014 not just to other classes of bondholders, but even payments to government workers and pensioners. That provision is increasingly becoming a sore point as the island\u2019s economy has withered, schools are closed, taxes rise and other public services are cut.Puerto Rico has already defaulted on a type of debt that it calls \u201cmoral obligation bonds,\u201d which are backed, in effect, by money that lawmakers were supposed to appropriate every year. This year, the legislature did not appropriate the money, and the Government Development Bank said it therefore had no legal obligation to pay.Two more debt payments, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, are due in December and January. The government has warned that it is likely to run out of cash in November, and that it may not be able to make the two payments while providing essential public services. The payment due Jan. 1, 2016, is on general obligation debt, raising the issue of the island\u2019s constitutional guarantee. Senior officials have said they expect to be able to make the payment, but they have not explained where they will get the money.An unknown part of the $400 million now locked up at the collections agency is intended to be used to pay general obligation debt. A 1991 law authorized the agency to collect a special surtax to cover general obligation bond payments, and called for the development bank to establish a trust to hold the money until the payments came due. Although the trust fund was not established until 1997, the bank said that \u201cthe funds for paying the debts of the municipalities have always been separate from all other commonwealth government funds, and have always been distributed pursuant to the law.\u201dWith a cash squeeze looming, Puerto Rico has also been seeking help from Congress, and Ms. Acosta was among those who testified this week before the Senate Finance Committee. She said Puerto Rico\u2019s economy had contracted by 20 percent in real terms since 2007, but its outstanding public debt had grown by 60 percent, causing a level of pain not known on the mainland United States since the 1930s.The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, called on the island to make more information available about its finances and debts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Welfare\u2019s Corrupting Influence on the Poor", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneDoes welfare corrupt the poor?Few ideas are so deeply ingrained in the American popular imagination as the belief that government aid for poor people will just encourage bad behavior.Today, almost 20 years after Mr. Clinton signed a law that stopped the federal entitlement to cash assistance for low-income families with children, the argument has solidified into a core tenet influencing social policy not only in the United States but also around the world.One billion people in developing countries participate in a social safety net. At least one type of unconditional cash assistance is used in 119 countries. In 52 other countries, cash transfers are conditioned on relatively benign requirements like parents\u2019 enrolling their children in school.Still, Professor Banerjee observed, in many countries, \u201cwe encounter the idea that handouts will make people lazy.\u201dProfessor Banerjee suggests the spread of welfare aversion around the world might be an American confection. \u201cMany governments have economic advisers with degrees from the United States who share the same ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeology is much more pervasive than the facts.\u201dWhat is most perplexing is that the United States\u2019 own experience with both welfare and its \u201creform\u201d does not really support the charges.And what about jobs? There is little doubt that welfare can discourage employment, particularly when recipients lose benefits quickly as their earnings from work rise.What did the United States achieve with welfare reform?But the cheering faded. Over time the labor supply of less-educated single mothers, those with at most a high school education, returned to its earlier level. Poverty rebounded, as did births outside marriage.\u201cWhat we lost is a commitment to the poor who face significant barriers to work, whether because of child care or physical or mental disabilities,\u201d Mr. Ziliak said. \u201cWe have walked away from cash for that group and that group has suffered considerably.\u201dWhy is this debate still relevant today? The evidence has not caught up with the popular belief that welfare reform was a huge success.The old welfare strategy Mr. Murray blamed for so many social ills died long ago. Its replacement is tiny by comparison, providing cash to only about a quarter of poor families and typically only enough to take them a quarter of the way out of poverty.Still, it remains under siege. And the arguments against it are pretty much the same that President Reagan made 30 years ago.Before the United States goes down that road again, however, it might make sense to reassess the strength of the underlying argument: that poor people will never act responsibly, get a job and stay in a family unless they are thrown into the swimming pool and left to struggle with little support from the rest of us.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Membership Lets Britons Share Their Pain", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe main takeaway from a speech last week by Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, on Britain\u2019s European Union membership was that it is good for economic dynamism but creates challenges for financial stability.His first point is right; his second point needs qualification. Although European Union membership creates challenges for stability, it also gives Britain opportunities to make its economy steadier. If Britain grasps these, the European Union can act as a shock absorber.Membership in the bloc has made Britain more open to trade and more closely linked with other European Union economies. As a result, Britain is more exposed to shocks coming from across the English Channel. But membership can also dilute the effect of domestic shocks, as these reverberate across the European Union and further afield, rather than being contained within the country.Britain\u2019s exposure to European Union problems is fairly obvious after the still-fresh euro crisis. Given that 40 percent of British exports are to the eurozone, recession there dragged on the British economy.There was financial contagion too. British banks suffered losses because they had lent to eurozone countries. Meanwhile, eurozone banks cut their lending to Britain as they retrenched, increasing the effect of the credit crunch.European Union membership, which gives British financial firms a \u201cpassport\u201d to operate across the other countries, is also one reason Britain\u2019s banking industry has grown so rapidly in the past generation. While this has created wealth, Britain was hit especially hard during the global financial crisis because of its dependence on the industry.Britain\u2019s ability to share its pain with the rest of the European Union is less at the top of people\u2019s minds. But it is no less real. When Britain suffers a decline in domestic demand, its companies can find alternative sources of business across the Channel, softening the impact on incomes and employment at home. The European Union can provide what Mr. Carney calls a \u201csecond engine.\u201dBritons can also take advantage of free movement of labor to find work abroad. At present, European Union citizens are coming to Britain because it is generating lots of jobs. But in the future the tables could be turned.Free movement of capital helps in a downturn too. Because British savers don\u2019t have all their eggs in the domestic basket, the effect on their wealth and income is cushioned.The European Union\u2019s single market is not perfect. So Britain\u2019s ability to spread shocks to other parts of Europe is not as effective as, say, California\u2019s ability to share its pain with the rest of the United States. But the European Union economy is becoming more integrated, in part because of initiatives like the union of capital markets, the union of energy and extension of the single market to the Internet. So, if Britain stays in the European Union, it will find it an increasingly effective shock absorber.European Union membership has also helped make Britain more efficient and fleet of foot, according to Mr. Carney, fostering dynamism. This makes it resilient when there is trouble.A final factor that determines stability is effective financial regulation. Although neither Britain nor the European Union did a good job in the approach to the credit crunch, the regime is now better. Britain has had a big influence on those rules, both via its European Union membership and because it has weight in global standard-setting bodies, in part because it can often bring along the rest of the European Union with it.Mr. Carney pointed out that some new European Union regulations are not appropriate. Britain doesn\u2019t always get its way. In particular, the bankers\u2019 bonus cap makes it harder to claw back compensation when things go wrong \u2014 meaning financiers may have less incentive to take care in the first place.The governor also argued that closer union among eurozone countries will require more harmonization of financial regulations. If so, it will be important to ensure that inappropriate rules aren\u2019t imposed on Britain. Avoiding that risk is rightly one of the government\u2019s priorities as it seeks to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union.On the other hand, Britain benefits from having a single set of high-quality financial rules across the European Union.This means it can have reasonable confidence that European Union banks operating in Britain are properly regulated.If Britain were to quit the European Union and wanted its banks to operate across the Channel, it would still have to follow the bloc\u2019s financial rules. But it would have less influence on what those rules were, increasing the risk that they were lower quality and less suited to its needs. It would move from being one of the main rule makers to being a rule taker.Mr. Carney acknowledged many of these points. But his conclusion plays some of the positives of being part of the bloc. Provided that Britain fights to improve financial regulation and the single market\u2019s shock-absorbing capacity, European Union membership will be good for stability, as well as dynamism.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Quarterly Earnings Reports Can Still Move Markets", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesIt is earnings season, and for much of corporate America it is a time of trouble.Publicly traded companies have been revealing their profits and losses for the third quarter of the year and signaling some of their expectations for the future. While a few big companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft posted strong earnings last week, many of the report cards have been dreary.Factors like global interest rates, politics and the national mood affect the stock market, but earnings are crucial, and how investors interpret this deluge of information may well determine whether share prices keep rising in the months ahead. Some of the mediocre earnings data has already been baked into share prices, which rose sharply last week and have just about recovered from the summer\u2019s sharp decline.But even in an era of seemingly limitless online information and nanosecond trading, quarterly earnings reports and conference calls retain their ability to move markets, a new study has found.It found that the impact of earnings reports on stock prices has increased since a series of Wall Street scandals led to regulatory reforms that appear to have improved the reliability of the reports, Ms. McNichols said. \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that the markets are deriving a great deal of information from these reports.\u201dThis season, much of the information has been gloomy, and it may take some mental gymnastics to see a silver lining in it. The global economy has slowed, the energy sector has been battered, and the strength of the dollar has reduced sales and profits overseas.When all of the data is in, Wall Street is expecting that for the third quarter of 2015, overall earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index will have declined, perhaps by as much as 3 percent. This follows a weak second quarter \u2014 one that, depending on which numbers you use, was flat or slightly negative.What\u2019s more, based on corporate disclosures and Wall Street expectations, the decline in profits is projected to continue for the rest of this year.But bad as this litany may seem, it may not be the end of the downward trajectory in earnings. While the consensus on Wall Street is that 2016 will be better for big corporations, things are not expected to improve significantly until the end of next year \u2014 a distant and relatively opaque period, as far as such analysis goes.\u201cWall Street analysts are usually more optimistic in their projections for a year down the road and become more realistic when the time for earnings draws closer,\u201d said John Butters, a senior research analyst at FactSet. \u201cThat\u2019s happening again this year.\u201dThat said, it may well be realistic to expect an improvement in an important sector: energy, which accounts for the biggest drag on earnings. While third-quarter earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to drop 2.8 percent over all compared with the same period a year earlier, the drop for energy companies is estimated to be 65 percent, according to Wall Street consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Companies like Halliburton, which reported a 36 percent drop in revenue and a $54 million loss for the third quarter on Monday, have been hit hard by the decline in oil, coal and natural gas prices of the last year.But by the end of 2016, energy companies will be comparing their earnings with this year\u2019s dismal results, a much easier contest. It is also quite possible that energy prices will rise from the doldrums by then, bolstering the sector and statistics for the entire stock market.That\u2019s hardly the only earnings problem. Other sectors, like technology, have turned in weak overall performances.With reports like these, it may seem difficult to derive a positive message from this season\u2019s information. Yet many investors habitually discount bad news and highlight the bright side.Are reports of declining profits \u2014 or outright losses \u2014 really good? Perhaps not, but they are often not perceived as devastating.When losses are disclosed, they are often seen as \u201cunsustainable, often one-time events,\u201d Ms. McNichols said. The logic is that for-profit corporations exist only for that purpose: to make a profit. Executives must stem losses, if they hope to keep their jobs.Wall Street analysts therefore sometimes assume that the disclosure of a loss implies that corrective measures are being taken. On the other hand, disclosure of rising profit prospects is often taken as a sign of sustainable prosperity and may be enough to bolster share prices, she said.That is because when you buy a share of a company\u2019s stock, you are buying a portion of that company\u2019s long-term earnings stream. If you pay a reasonable price, you should have a good chance of profiting. That is the theory, at least. And it helps explain why many investors focus on earnings next year and the year after that, even when current earnings are miserable.Of course, some of this may be just be based on hope. For the market to rise much more this year, investors may just have to trust that the earnings downturn is an aberration.Advertisement"}

Among the expected deals is a Chinese investment in a long-delayed nuclear power station in Britain. British officials have said that such a deal could pave the way for Chinese investment in another nuclear plant that would be designed and constructed by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. So far, there are no publicly known British deals in Xinjiang.\u201cObviously, George Osborne has decided that getting the Chinese to invest large amounts in the U.K. is the salvation of the U.K. economy,\u201d said Ian Bond, the director of foreign policy of the Center for European Reform. \u201cHe is running roughshod over the Foreign Office and security policy.\u201dBritain, a close ally of the United States, was the first Western country to apply for membership this year in China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, despite Washington\u2019s opposition.The Chinese government appreciates the British government\u2019s decision to put business ahead of much else, said Song Xinning, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cThe British have not only the brain for business, but also the wisdom on strategy,\u201d Dr. Song said, reflecting the Chinese government\u2019s view. \u201cBritain is now the second-largest trading partner for China in the European Union, and it used to be No. 4.\u201dSince then, Mr. Cameron has not seen the Dalai Lama and has essentially handed the China portfolio to Mr. Osborne, whose focus is finance and investment.The British government has been criticized by many for putting commercial interests ahead of other concerns, including cybersecurity and China\u2019s growing territorial ambitions, as well as human rights.In an awkward twist before Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, one of the few surviving copies of the 13th century Magna Carta, a document that outlines guarantees for individual rights, was not put on display at Renmin University in Beijing as scheduled last week. The document, which may have appeared too politically explosive, was transferred to a small room at the British Embassy for what the Foreign Office called \u201cadministrative\u201d reasons.The design of the nuclear plant that the Chinese are poised to invest in has drawn criticism, and the continued involvement of China in nuclear power in Britain has raised questions about national security.The plant, known as Hinkley Point C, to be built in Somerset, England, has been designed by a French company that has had problems making that design work, said Isabel Hilton, the editor of Chinadialogue, a bilingual website based in London. Two state-owned Chinese companies, China General Nuclear Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation, are expected to reach an agreement to take a 30 percent to 40 percent stake in the plant, British officials have said.\u201cThe bait for the Chinese, according to the U.K. government, is the promise that they will be allowed to build and operate a further plant in Essex,\u201d Ms. Hilton said. \u201cThis puts a Chinese state-owned enterprise in the U.K.\u2019s critical infrastructure, a radical move that certainly merits a public debate on the grounds of national security.\u201dYufan Huan contributed research.Advertisement"}

They may have pizza on a Friday night where they didn\u2019t before, or they may buy an extra pair of shoes for their kids to wear to school.\u201dThe decision, which Ms. Miner estimated would add about $222,000 to Syracuse\u2019s annual payroll, may draw criticism amid the city\u2019s current financial struggles. The city, in central New York, has run deficits of several million dollars in recent years.She said Syracuse could afford the higher wages because its annual pension costs had been declining.\u201cThere is no such thing as a decision that everybody likes,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very comfortable that this is the right thing for the workers and for the city.\u201dSome of the affected workers are members of unions that have contracts with the city. Ms. Miner took the unusual step of raising their pay outside of contract negotiations.\u201cWe\u2019d love to see other mayors follow her lead on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cOur members live and work in the community, so they will spend it in the community.\u201dStephen A. Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, said that a small number of its 300,000 members in the state would be directly affected, but that the move could have a ripple effect.\u201cWe give Mayor Miner a lot of credit for doing this because it\u2019s a really good action to try to deal with an economy that\u2019s out of balance,\u201d Mr. Madarasz said. \u201cWe hope that she will set the example for many other public officials across New York State.\u201dSome cities on the West Coast, including Los Angeles and Seattle, have approved increases in their minimum wages to $15, in stages.Mayors in New York do not have the authority to take that action. Their only options are to persuade state lawmakers to change the statute that sets the minimum wage or to raise wages for their own employees or workers at companies receiving contracts or subsidies from their city. State and municipal employees are not covered by the statewide minimum.New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has been frustrated in his efforts to get the Legislature to raise the statewide minimum and to allow the city to have an even higher one. Last year, Mayor de Blasio signed an executive order that extended the city\u2019s living wage law to more workers, at projects that receive big subsidies from the city. The order set the living wage at $13.13 an hour, or $11.50 with health benefits.A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said that the city\u2019s contracts with its employees ensured that they would be paid more than the rising minimum wage Mr. Cuomo has proposed, up to $15 in a few years from $8.75 an hour now.\u201cThe mayor will continue to work collaboratively with our work force and continue to fight for state and federal action on an increased minimum wage that would lift up all New Yorkers and move our economy forward,\u201d the spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, said in a statement.Advertisement"}

Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina \u2014 managed to make it through the evening with few stumbles but also without many memorable moments, while laggards such as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Huckabee were steady but did little to break through.The biggest loser, particularly in the minds of conservatives, was CNBC, the network that hosted the debate. Criticism of the news media was a recurring theme onstage, and that sentiment extended into Twitter and blogs after the debate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing is a transcript of the main Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.QUINTANILLA: Good evening, I\u2019m Carl Quintanilla, with my colleagues Becky Quick and John Harwood. We\u2019ll be joined tonight by some of CNBC\u2019s top experts on the markets and personal finance.QUINTANILLA: Let\u2019s get through the rules of the road. Candidates get 30 seconds to answer the opening question, 60 seconds to answer a formal question, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals, all at the discretion of the moderators.We want you to weigh in from home. You\u2019ll see your tweets at the bottom of the screen. Use the hashtag, #cNBCgopdebate. You can also go to cNBC.com/vote to tell us where you stand throughout the night.So let\u2019s introduce the candidates for tonight\u2019s Republican presidential debate. On the stage from left to right, Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mrs. Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE) And Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)A lot to get to tonight. So let\u2019s get started. This first is an open question.This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s your biggest weakness?\u201d So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that you\u2019re a perfectionist...(LAUGHTER)...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it? We\u2019ll go left to right. Governor Kasich, 30 seconds.KASICH: Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.I\u2019ve watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out \u2014 out in the \u2014 in the cold. I\u2019ve heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 \u2014 people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. I\u2019ve heard about tax schemes that don\u2019t add up, that put our kids in \u2014 in a deeper hole than they are today.We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...QUINTANILLA: Governor?KASICH: You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I\u2019m president, to get this country moving again.KASICH: country moving again.QUINTANILLA: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, John, I don\u2019t really have any weaknesses that I can think of.(LAUGHTER)But my wife is down here in the front, and I\u2019m sure, if you\u2019d like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you\u2019ll ever be able to take care of.If I have a weakness, it\u2019s that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.And I\u2019ll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. Governor Bush.BUSH: You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be \u2014 stick with it, and all that.But also, I can\u2019t fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. It\u2019s never been that way in American politics before.BUSH: I can\u2019t do it. I just don\u2019t believe that this country\u2019s days are going to be deeply \u2014 you know, going down. I think we\u2019re on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America\u2019s future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.I think there\u2019s a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesn\u2019t have to be true.Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If we\u2019re willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we\u2019ve had in the history of this great nation.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. I\u2019m too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I don\u2019t know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said \u201clet up.\u201d(LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson?CARSON: Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagan\u2019s 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.And recognizing that it\u2019s so important, this election, because we\u2019re talking about America for the people versus America for the government.QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina?FIORINA: Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn\u2019t smile enough. (LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Fixed it.FIORINA: But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: I\u2019m too agreeable, easy going.(LAUGHTER)You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. I\u2019m a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. I\u2019ve been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.QUINTANILLA: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I don\u2019t see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I can\u2019t figure out which one is which.(LAUGHTER)But I will \u2014 but I will tell you this, the socialist says they\u2019re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don\u2019t say they\u2019re going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. It\u2019s Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won\u2019t get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.QUINTANILLA: Senator Paul?PAUL: You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.QUINTANILLA: Thanks to all the candidates.John?HARWOOD: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.TRUMP: That\u2019s right.HARWOOD: Let\u2019s be honest.(LAUGHTER)Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?TRUMP: No, not a comic book, and it\u2019s not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. We\u2019re reducing taxes to 15 percent. We\u2019re bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned, we\u2019re going to build a wall. We\u2019re going to create a border. We\u2019re going to let people in, but they\u2019re going to come in legally. They\u2019re going to come in legally. And it\u2019s something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. That\u2019s 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.TRUMP: We can do a wall. We\u2019re going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. We\u2019re going to have people come in, but they\u2019re coming in legally. And Mexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall because Mexico \u2014 I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders \u2014 but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states \u2014 I don\u2019t want to \u2014 a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance...Excuse me, John.... of $50 billion...HARWOOD: We\u2019re at the 60 seconds.TRUMP: ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.HARWOOD: We\u2019re at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on, hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship.TRUMP: Right. Dynamically.HARWOOD: I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.TRUMP: Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who\u2019s a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump\u2019s tax plan.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation says \u2014 has looked at all of our plans and \u2014 and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit... QUICK: Gentlemen \u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to this \u2014 just a minute \u2014 just a minute we\u2019re gonna continue this.I wanna talk taxes...QUINTANILLA: Hold it. We\u2019ll cut it back to you in just a minute. Becky\u2019s moving on.QUICK: Dr. Carson, let\u2019s talk about taxes.You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and \u2014 I\u2019ve looked at it \u2014 and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I\u2019ve had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you\u2019re gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, it\u2019s gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?CARSON: Well, first of all, I didn\u2019t say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.QUICK: I \u2014 I understand that, but if you \u2014 if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.CARSON: The rate \u2014 the rate \u2014 the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.QUICK: 15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.So, also, we can stimulate the economy. That\u2019s gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy \u2014 because it\u2019s tethered down right now with so many regulations...QUICK: You\u2019d have to cut \u2014 you\u2019d have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: That\u2019s not true.QUICK: That is true, I looked at the numbers.CARSON: When \u2014 when we put all the facts down, you\u2019ll be able to see that it\u2019s not true, it works out very well.QUICK: Dr. Carson, thank you.KASICH: Listen, I want to just comment.HARWOOD: Governor Kasich, hold it, I\u2019m coming to you right now. The...KASICH: Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy...HARWOOD: Well, I\u2019m asking you about this.KASICH: This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.HARWOOD: I\u2019m about to ask you about this.That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what\u2019s happening in your party and what you\u2019re hearing from the two gentlemen we\u2019ve just heard from. Would you repeat it?KASICH: I\u2019m the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.You can\u2019t do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.I actually have a plan. I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I\u2019m realistic. You just don\u2019t make promises like this.Why don\u2019t we just give a chicken in every pot, while we\u2019re, you know, coming up \u2014 coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. We\u2019ll just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. We\u2019re up 347,000 jobs.When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.That\u2019s was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what you\u2019re doing. Creativity.This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, that\u2019s just not \u2014 you scare senior citizens with that. It\u2019s not responsible.HARWOOD: Well, let\u2019s just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.Who were you talking about?KASICH: Well, I mean right here. To talk about we\u2019re just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna fund the government? And we\u2019re going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that we\u2019re just going to be great? Or we\u2019re going to ship 10 million Americans \u2014 or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?Folks, we\u2019ve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesn\u2019t know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan.QUINTANILLA: Governor \u2014 Governor. thank you, Governor.KASICH: And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.TRUMP: First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number \u2014 and that is important for you to know.Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, I\u2019m never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got \u2014 that is why he is on the end.(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: Let me just \u2014 let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we\u2019re diversified. We\u2019re one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well.And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn\u2019t on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...QUICK: Governor...KASICH: ... an agreement with the...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. It\u2019s a joke.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor.QUICK: Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...(CROSSTALK)CARSON: Since I was attacked too.QUICK: Thank you.CARSON: Let me just say, if you\u2019re talking about an $18 trillion economy, you\u2019re talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You\u2019re talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.CRUZ: Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.QUICK: Senator \u2014 Senator, thank you.CRUZ: Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.QUICK: Gentlemen, I\u2019m sorry, we need to...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: We\u2019re going to try to move on.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code.There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.QUINTANILLA: You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?FIORINA: That\u2019s right, three pages.QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: You know why three?QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: No. You know why three? Because only if it\u2019s about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.So yes, you\u2019re going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform \u2014QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina \u2014FIORINA: \u2014 the issue is who is going to get it done.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: We\u2019re going to \u2014QUICK: We\u2019re going to move on.QUINTANILLA: We will come around the bend, i promise. This one is for Senator Rubio. You\u2019ve been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s. You\u2019ve had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don\u2019t support anymore. Now, you\u2019re skipping more votes than any senator to run for president. Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?RUBIO: That\u2019s an interesting question. That\u2019s exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why don\u2019t you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We can\u2019t afford to have another four years like the last eight years.Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. They\u2019re working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven\u2019t had a raise in decades.You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world that\u2019s out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.We have a \u2014 they say there\u2019s no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we \u2014 if we don\u2019t act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.QUINTANILLA: So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?RUBIO: Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It\u2019s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.QUINTANILLA: Well, do you hate your job?RUBIO: Let me \u2014 let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don\u2019t recall them calling for his resignation \u2014QUINTANILLA: Is that the standard?RUBIO: Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don\u2019t recall the Sun \u2014 in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John.BUSH: Could I \u2014 could I bring something up here, because I\u2019m a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. He\u2019s a gifted politician.But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate \u2014 what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they\u2019re looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.RUBIO: I get to respond, right?QUICK: Thirty seconds.RUBIO: Well, it\u2019s interesting. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you\u2019re modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you\u2019re going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you\u2019re now modeling after?BUSH: He wasn\u2019t my senator.RUBIO: No Jeb, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 well, let me tell you. I don\u2019t remember you ever complaining about John McCain\u2019s vote record. The only reason why you\u2019re doing it now is because we\u2019re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.BUSH: Well, I\u2019ve been \u2014RUBIO: Here\u2019s the bottom line.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m not \u2014 my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it\u2019s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. I\u2019m not running against Governor Bush, I\u2019m not running against anyone on this stage. I\u2019m running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Senator.TRUMP: I think you\u2019re \u2014(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on. I think there\u2019s a \u2014 I\u2019ve got question for \u2014(CROSSTALK)KASICH: John Harwood, there\u2019s a bigger issue here.HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. I\u2019ve got a question for Governor Bush.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: No, we\u2019re moving to Governor Bush. Governor, the fact that you\u2019re at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.HARWOOD: You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you \u2014BUSH: No, no. What I said was I don\u2019t believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.HARWOOD: OK.BUSH: Don\u2019t vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: Got it.BUSH: But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: But it\u2019s a \u2014 OK. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a question about why you\u2019re having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context.Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why you\u2019re having a difficult time in this race?BUSH: (inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They don\u2019t believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.They\u2019re concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on people\u2019s aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I\u2019ve laid out.And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: We\u2019re gonna get down the line. Becky\u2019s got a question.QUICK: We\u2019ll get to everyone.Ms. Fiorina, I \u2014 I\u2019d like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously, you\u2019ve talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.I just wonder, in terms of all of that \u2014 you know, we look back, your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.FIORINA: You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent \u2014 80 percent \u2014 and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company.It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.As an outsider, I tackled H.P.\u2019s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business \u2014 like Gateway \u2014 taking all their jobs with them.The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, \u201cyou know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. She\u2019d be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, it\u2019s interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...(APPLAUSE) ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.I think his quote was that, \u201cif you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes.\u201d Is this the type of person you want defending you?FIORINA: Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.(LAUGHTER)Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don\u2019t always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable. Imagine \u2014 imagine \u2014 if a politician were held to that standard of account.I will run on my record all day long.(APPLAUSE)And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina.FIORINA: ...and be held accountable.QUICK: Thank you, we\u2019re out of time. Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.Carl.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz. Congressional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of \u2014 another Washington-created crisis is on the way.Does your opposition to it show that you\u2019re not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?CRUZ: You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don\u2019t trust the media.(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?\u201d \u201cBen Carson, can you do math?\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich, will you insult two people over here?\u201d \u201cMarco Rubio, why don\u2019t you resign?\u201d \u201cJeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?\u201dHow about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: (inaudible) do we get credit (inaudible)?CRUZ: And Carl \u2014 Carl, I\u2019m not finished yet.CRUZ: The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, \u201cWhich of you is more handsome and why?\u201d(LAUGHTER)And let me be clear.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: So, this is a question about (inaudible), which you have 30 seconds left to answer, should you choose to do so.CRUZ: Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.(LAUGHTER)And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldn\u2019t be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: OK. (inaudible) I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: You want me to answer that question? I\u2019m happy to answer the question...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator Paul, I\u2019ve got a question for you on the same subject.CRUZ: ... so you don\u2019t actually want to hear the answer, John?HARWOOD: Senator Paul?CRUZ: You don\u2019t want to hear the answer. You just want to...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: You used your time on something else.Senator Paul?CRUZ: You\u2019re not interested in an answer.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country\u2019s long-term budget deficit. Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn\u2019t cut those programs enough?PAUL: No, I oppose it because you\u2019re taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re taking money from Social Security and they\u2019re going to spend it on the military and they\u2019re going to spend it on domestic spending.Here\u2019s the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.HARWOOD: Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?PAUL: Well, that\u2019s a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly don\u2019t think there will be much change because I think what\u2019s going to happen is you\u2019re going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well, you know what I\u2019m worried about? Not keeping the government open. I\u2019m worried about bankrupting the American people.We\u2019re borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And that\u2019s what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator (inaudible).QUICK: Governor Christie, I\u2019d like to (inaudible) a question next. Actually, I have a question for you (inaudible).In your tell it like it is campaign, you\u2019ve said a lot of tough things. You\u2019ve said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they\u2019ve earned. It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?RITCHIE: Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All that\u2019s in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.And they\u2019ve stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. We\u2019re sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, that\u2019s with zero percent interest rates.Now, I\u2019m the only person that\u2019s put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And we\u2019ll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And, here\u2019s the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clinton\u2019s going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebody\u2019s already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I\u2019m going to give people who\u2019ve done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. We\u2019re not \u2014 the American people \u2014 forget about anything else, they\u2019ve already been lied to and stolen from. And...QUICK: ...Governor...CHRISTIE: ...I\u2019m going to go to Washington to stop it...QUICK: ...Thank you.QUINTANILLA: We promised we would get to everyone this block. Governor Huckabee, I\u2019m going to give you 60 seconds on this.HUCKABEE: Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, we\u2019ve stolen. Yes, we\u2019ve lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.But, you know what we\u2019re not telling them? It\u2019s their money. This isn\u2019t the governments money. This is not entitlement, it\u2019s not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, we\u2019re going to blame the people.Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, they\u2019re always going to say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to fix this one day.\u201dNo their not. It\u2019s like a 400 pound man saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to go on a diet, but I\u2019m eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do.\u201dAnd, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Let\u2019s quit blaming the people on Social Security. Let\u2019s quit making it a problem for them. It\u2019s like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we\u2019re going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...QUINTANILLA: ...Governor...HUCKABEE: ...No, sir...QUINTANILLA: ...Thank you, Governor...HUCKABEE: ...we need to honor our promises...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: ...Senator Cruz...HUCKABEE: ...before I go. This is the only time I\u2019ve had a chance, let me finish.QUINTANILLA: OK, alright.HUCKABEE: ...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And, the fact is, none of them.(CROSSTALK)MALE: And, by the way, Carl...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, the only way \u2014 no...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ...The only way we\u2019re going to be morale, the only way we\u2019re going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.It isn\u2019t there anymore, Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. It\u2019s not theirs anymore. The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago... HUCKABEE: ...Chris...CHRISTIE: So, let\u2019s stop fooling around about this, let\u2019s tell people the truth. For once, let\u2019s do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that\u2019s never going to come true.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz...HUCKABEE: ...Chris...QUINTANILLA: ...Before we go to break, we\u2019re clearly not having that beer you mentioned, but I\u2019ll give you 30 more seconds...CRUZ: ...Then I\u2019ll buy you a tequila...QUINTANILLA: OK.CRUZ: ...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.QUINTANILLA: I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond...(CHEERING)QUINTANILLA: (INAUDIBLE)HUCKABEE: Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?QUINTANILLA: Respond on the debt limit, or an answer to the governor, which ever you choose.CRUZ: Well, sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington\u2019s broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. Governor Huckabee\u2019s exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers \u2014 look. I\u2019m 44 years old.It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.QUINTANILLA: 30 seconds, Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: John, listen, let\u2019s keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let\u2019s just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don\u2019t need seven rooms, we\u2019re going to take two of them away?HUCKABEE: Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesn\u2019t pay it, than tell me what\u2019s different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Governor, thank you. We will take a break. The Republican Presidential debate, live from Boulder, Colorado, coming back after a break on CNBC.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)QUICK: Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans. We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.Folks, we\u2019ll get right back into this.Mr. Trump, let\u2019s talk a little bit about bankruptcies. Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times. In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this. You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did. But some of the individuals \u2014 the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn\u2019t fare so well.Bankruptcy is a broken promise. Why should the voters believe the promises that you\u2019re telling them right now?TRUMP: Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I\u2019m not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they\u2019ve all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. I\u2019m not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesar\u2019s \u2014 excuse me \u2014 Caesar\u2019s, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy \u2014 the biggest.But also the biggest people (ph) \u2014 now I\u2019ve used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.Now hundreds of companies I\u2019ve opened. I\u2019ve used it three times, maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess I\u2019m supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me.But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you\u2019re using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And I\u2019m glad I did it.I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I\u2019m sorry.QUICK: Mr. Trump, thank you.TRUMP: Thank you.CRAMER: Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs. You have spent a lifetime in medicine.Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?CARSON: Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don\u2019t take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that we\u2019re having such difficulty right now with our job market.Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they\u2019re manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.So what we\u2019re going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we\u2019re going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.CRAMER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect. One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches. No one went to jail.As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?CHRISTIE: You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. They don\u2019t like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. It\u2019s a political Justice Department.And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.And to expand on Mr. Carson\u2019s \u2014 or Dr. Carson\u2019s question, let\u2019s face it, we have laws already. We don\u2019t need newer (ph) laws. We don\u2019t need Hillary Clinton\u2019s price controls for \u2014 again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Let\u2019s let a Justice Department \u2014 and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life.CRAMER: Thank you, Governor Christie.HARWOOD: Jim, thanks.Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal. Still feel that way?BUSH: Well, the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You don\u2019t have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people\u2019s income.HARWOOD: But to \u2014 to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar...BUSH: You find me...HARWOOD: ...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?BUSH: You find me a Democrat \u2014 you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. I\u2019ll talk to them.HARWOOD: So you don\u2019t want the coach to put you in any more?BUSH: Look, the \u2014 the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending\u2019s gone up. You find a Democrat that\u2019s for cutting taxes \u2014 cutting spending ten dollars, I\u2019ll give them a warm kiss.(LAUGHTER)HARWOOD: Thank you, governor.Carl?QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea. Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree. Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?FIORINA: You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.What\u2019s crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless \u2014 in this case, 1,590 community banks \u2014 go out of business.You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying, \u201cwe\u2019re going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet,\u201d is going to create massive problems.But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is what\u2019s going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.It\u2019s why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. It\u2019s why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. It\u2019s you see the health insurance companies getting together. It\u2019s why you see the banks consolidating.And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina.FIORINA: It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.QUINTANILLA: OK.FIORINA: It\u2019s the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.QUINTANILLA: Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) QUICK: Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that you\u2019ve had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That\u2019s something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?RUBIO: Well, you just \u2014 you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I\u2019m not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But I\u2019m going to tell you the truth.Here\u2019s the truth. I didn\u2019t inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.They didn\u2019t save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.(LAUGHTER)I know what it\u2019s like to owe that money, and we\u2019ve worked hard. We\u2019ve worked hard our whole life to provide a better family \u2014 a better life for our family.We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I\u2019ve been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.But I\u2019m not worried about my finances, I\u2019m worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And that\u2019s what this economy needs to \u2014 that\u2019s what this debate needs to be about.This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we\u2019ve always said this country is all about.QUICK: Senator, I understand all of that. I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too. But you\u2019ve had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven\u2019t. You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.RUBIO: And I used it to pay off my loans. And it\u2019s available on paperback, if you\u2019re interested in buying my book.(APPLAUSE)QUICK: But you \u2014 but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed. That \u2014 that was after you\u2019d already come into that windfall. That\u2019s why I raised the question.RUBIO: Yeah, again, as I said, we\u2019re raising a family in the 21st century and it\u2019s one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn\u2019t read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it\u2019s become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they\u2019re trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.We can\u2019t afford another four years of that. Which is what we\u2019re gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.Thank you, senator.HARWOOD: Governor John Kasich, you\u2019ve called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors. You call that corporate welfare.One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that\u2019s corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort \u2014 jobs Ohio.If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren\u2019t they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?KASICH: Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it\u2019s time to clean up corporate welfare. If we\u2019re gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I\u2019ve cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state \u2014 $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.This is the same old stuff since I left.You spend the money today and then you hope you\u2019re going to save money tomorrow.I don\u2019t know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives \u2014 our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.And you know what? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country \u2014 I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I\u2019ll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.KASICH: ... If I become President because we\u2019ll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Thank you.QUICK: Yes, thank you John.Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn. And I know that you\u2019ve said you\u2019ve been very sympathetic to our cause. But you\u2019ve also you said that the Democrats\u2019 moves to try and change this are the political show votes.I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?CRUZ: Well, we\u2019ve gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.The Democrats\u2019 answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.You know, you look at women working. I\u2019ll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom who\u2019s here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I \u2014 the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it\u2019s single moms, it\u2019s Hispanics. That is who I\u2019m fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.FIORINA: 92 percent \u2014 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama\u2019s first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women \u2014QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina \u2014FIORINA: \u2014 living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies \u2014QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you.FIORINA: \u2014 work better to lift everyone up, men and women.QUICK: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Carl?(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco\u2019s. Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?CARSON: Well, obviously, you don\u2019t understand my views on homosexuality. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. And there is no reason that you can\u2019t be perfectly fair to the gay community.They shouldn\u2019t automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. You know, that\u2019s what the PC culture is all about, and it\u2019s destroying this nation.The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other\u2019s enemies, it\u2019s those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. And we need to make that very clear to everybody.(APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: One more question. This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship. They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you\u2019re involvement continued. Why?CARSON: Well, that\u2019s easy to answer. I didn\u2019t have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda.I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.Do I take the product? Yes. I think it\u2019s a good product.QUINTANILLA: To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder \u2014CARSON: If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.QUINTANILLA: Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way.CARSON: No, it speaks to the fact that I don\u2019t know those \u2014(AUDIENCE BOOS)See? They know.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Apparently. We will take a break. We\u2019ll be back in Boulder in just a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HARWOOD: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.Senator Huckabee, I mean \u2014 excuse me \u2014 Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the heading, \u201cMarco Rubio wants to be the tech industry\u2019s savior.\u201d It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans. Why is he wrong?RUBIO: Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that you\u2019re going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you\u2019re not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.But here\u2019s the best solution of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they\u2019re still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that, what\u2019s happening is some of these tech companies are taking those \u2014 those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don\u2019t have to rely on people from abroad.HARWOOD: It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn\u2019t...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they\u2019re not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator.Becky?QUICK: Mr. Trump, let\u2019s stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs.TRUMP: I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he\u2019s complaining about the fact that we\u2019re losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country and they\u2019re immediately sent out.I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.QUICK: So you\u2019re in favor of...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So I have nothing at all critical of him.\u2018 QUICK: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Probably, I don\u2019t know \u2014 you people write the stuff. I don\u2019t know where you...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And if I could say just one thing. I am the only person in either campaign that\u2019s self-funding. I\u2019m putting up 100 percent of my own money. And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous \u2014 so far, I\u2019ve put up less than anybody and I have the best results. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice if the country could do that?But I will be putting \u2014 I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. SuperPacs are a disaster. They\u2019re a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. And I\u2019m not blaming these folks \u2014 well, I guess I could.(LAUGHTER)Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what\u2019s going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.QUICK: You know, Mr. \u2014 you know, Mr. Trump, if I may (inaudible). You\u2019ve been \u2014 you have been \u2014 you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that.QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?TRUMP: You\u2019ve got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...QUICK: My apologies. I\u2019m sorry.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... he\u2019s really doing some bad...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Since I\u2019ve been mentioned, can I respond?(CROSSTALK)QUICK: Yes, you can.RUBIO: OK. I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac. It\u2019s called the mainstream media who every single day...(APPLAUSE)... and I\u2019ll tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, \u201cHey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements.\u201d She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.It was the week she got exposed as a liar. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...(APPLAUSE)But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.QUICK: Senator Rubio, thank you very much.I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.SANTELLI: Senator Cruz, let\u2019s focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve. You\u2019ve been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency. Where do you want to take that?Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe?CRUZ: Well, Rick, it\u2019s a very important question. I have got deep concerns about the Fed. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul\u2019s audit the Fed legislation.The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. You know, it\u2019s interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. It\u2019s driving up stock prices. Wall Street is doing great.You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. But if you look at working men and women. If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.She sees her cost of electricity going up. She sees her health insurance going up. And loose money is one of the major problems. We need sound money. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.SANTELLI: Senator Paul, the same question to you.PAUL: Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. And I think it\u2019s precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. I don\u2019t think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. You want to study income inequality, let\u2019s bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.Let\u2019s also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they\u2019ve done to make us better or worse. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.What you need to do is free up interest rates. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn\u2019t have price controls on the price of money.SANTELLI: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you don\u2019t like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market. But you\u2019ve also said that you\u2019re in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.Isn\u2019t that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?CARSON: Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have...... the best results, wouldn\u2019t that be nice if the country could do that?But I will be putting \u2014 I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. Super PACs are a disaster. They\u2019re a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.And I\u2019m not blaming these folks \u2014 but I guess I could.(LAUGHTER)Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

I think you called him \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator\u201d because he was in favor H- 1B...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that.QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?TRUMP: He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...QUICK: My apologies. I\u2019m sorry...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Everybody is really doing some bad fact...RUBIO: Since I\u2019ve been mentioned, can I respond?QUICK: Yes. Yes, you may.RUBIO: OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it\u2019s called the mainstream media. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)And I\u2019ll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.

But you\u2019ve also said that you\u2019re in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.Isn\u2019t that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?CARSON: Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have studied that issue in great detail. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.And \u2014 you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers \u2014 this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of \u2014 great deal of problems for our society right now.And \u2014 and \u2014 you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. The reason that I \u2014 I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.That cost gets passed on to the people. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? It\u2019s poor people and middle class. Doesn\u2019t hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it\u2019s because of the rich. Well, I\u2019ll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won\u2019t even make a dent in it.SANTELLI: Thank you, Doctor.Becky?QUICK: Rick, thank you very much.Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality. You\u2019ve said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.HUCKABEE: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. In fact, that\u2019s part of the problem. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it\u2019s a perfect example of government.I mean, what we had was something the government made \u2014 basically a bag of gas \u2014 that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn\u2019t get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.That is our government today. We saw it in the blimp.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s exactly what we saw. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country\u2019s economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.And it\u2019s not the folks on Wall Street. I\u2019m not anti-Wall Street, but I don\u2019t believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: ...is paid \u2014 played fairly.QUICK: Thank you. Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don\u2019t cut me off too quick, Becky.QUICK: All right, Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Let me just close it out this way.QUICK: How about 15 more seconds?HUCKABEE: We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. And I\u2019ll tell you one thing that we never talk about \u2014 we haven\u2019t talked about it tonight.Why aren\u2019t we talking about \u2014 instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people \u2014 why don\u2019t we say, \u201clet\u2019s cure the four big cost-driving diseases...QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: ...\u201ddiabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s?\u201dQUICK: Governor, I\u2019m sorry...HUCKABEE: If you do that, you don\u2019t just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.QUICK: Governor, thank you.HUCKABEE: Gosh, I\u2019d love for us to talk about something like that. Thank you. QUICK: Governor, thank you. Appreciate it.John?HARWOOD: Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent \u2014 just like your plan does. But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.Given the problems we\u2019ve been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?BUSH: Look, the \u2014 the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don\u2019t pay any income tax at all.Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and \u2014 and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost \u2014 that\u2019s why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.The government has tried it their way. Under \u2014 under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they\u2019ve tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.We need to take a new approach of taxing \u2014 reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our \u2014 in our country before it\u2019s too late.HARWOOD: Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.Since you\u2019re the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don\u2019t you have that backward?RUBIO: No, that\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re wrong. In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there\u2019s a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.Number one, you have people in this country that...HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation \u2014 just to be clear, they said the...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.HARWOOD: No, I did not.RUBIO: You did. No, you did.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent.RUBIO: Well, you\u2019re talking about \u2014 yeah.HARWOOD: And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.RUBIO: Yeah, but that \u2014 because the math is, if you \u2014 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money...HARWOOD: (inaudible)RUBIO: ...numerically, it\u2019s gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here\u2019s why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.We are lowering taxes on small business. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. He\u2019s an S corporation. He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he\u2019s paying at his personal rate.RUBIO: Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ...The other thing I\u2019d like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn\u2019t tax investments at all. You know why? Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.I want to be in \u2014 I want America to be the best...PAUL: ...John...RUBIO: ...in the world for people...HARWOOD: Senator, thank you.PAUL: John, I\u2019d like to address this? John, could I follow up on this?QUINTANILLA: ...We\u2019ll come back around. I want to get to governor Kasich.PAUL: What are the rules on who gets to follow up. How do we decide on who gets to follow up? I\u2019ve seen plenty of other people follow up?QUICK: It\u2019s at the moderator discretion.QUINTANILLA: Governor Kasich, let\u2019s talk ...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: ...about Marijuana, Governor Kasich...PAUL: I\u2019d like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...QUINTANILLA: Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case. Sure, 30 seconds.PAUL: Alright. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. In fact, it\u2019s the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.If you just cut their income tax, there isn\u2019t much income tax to cut. Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you.CRUZ: Let me say on that...QUINTANILLA: Oh, no, no, no...CRUZ: ...Rand is exactly right. His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,QUINTANILLA: ...Ok...CRUZ: ...eliminates the business...MALE: (INAUDIBLE)CRUZ: ...income tax...MALE: What are you doing?CRUZ: ...10% flat rate...QUINTANILLA: ...We\u2019re going to go to...CRUZ: ...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: OK. Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich, let\u2019s talk about marijuana. We\u2019re broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year. Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he\u2019s said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they\u2019re just now paying taxes.Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you\u2019d like to have?KASICH: Well, first of all, we\u2019re running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we\u2019re not having a revenue problem right now. And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster. Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on. We could do a whole show on that.I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don\u2019t get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise. Again...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average. We\u2019ve cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment. Folks, you want to \u2014QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor.KASICH: \u2014 fix America, this is the formula. It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio. Thank you.QUINTANILLA: Thank you. We\u2019ll be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment.(APPLAUSE)(BREAK)QUICK: Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas. I found where I read that before. It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says \u2014 it says that again, Mark Zuckerburg\u2019s personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them?TRUMP: I\u2019m in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it anyway you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. I\u2019ve created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect \u2014 and actually some of these folks I really like a lot \u2014 but I\u2019m the only one that can say that. I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I\u2019ll be creating many millions of jobs if I\u2019m given \u2014 if I\u2019m given the opportunity to be president.As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have \u2014 it\u2019s fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders. We have a country of laws. We have to obey the laws. It\u2019s fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.QUICK: Thank you, sir.RUBIO: I was mentioned in the question.QUICK: You were. You get 30 seconds.RUBIO: Thank you.Well, I\u2019ve learned the rules on this.(LAUGHTER)Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. And that\u2019s the way my parents came legally in 1956.But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you\u2019re coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.QUICK: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.Carl?QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York.TRUMP: Yes.QUINTANILLA: After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, \u201cBy the way, it was a gun-free zone. If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off.\u201dTRUMP: Or somebody else. Right.QUINTANILLA: Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work?TRUMP: Yes, I might feel more comfortable. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York \u2014 a permit to carry. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. But I like to be unpredictable so that people don\u2019t know exactly... (LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Are you carrying one now?(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: By the way, unlike our country where we\u2019re totally predictable and the enemy, whether it\u2019s ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we\u2019re doing because we have the wrong leadership.(APPLAUSE)But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that\u2019s target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That\u2019s target. They look around for gun-free zones. You know, we could give you another example \u2014 the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. Two of them were among the most highly decorated \u2014 they weren\u2019t allowed on a military base to have guns. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. If they had guns, he wouldn\u2019t be around very long. I can tell you, there wouldn\u2019t have been much damage.So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. They\u2019re a feeding frenzy for sick people.QUINTANILLA: We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that \u2014 that do not allow guns with or without a permit. Would you change those policies?TRUMP: I would change them. I would change them.QUINTANILLA: OK. All right. Thank you.John?HARWOOD: Governor Huckabee, you\u2019ve written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles. As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together.The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?HUCKABEE: You know, of the few questions I\u2019ve got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. I\u2019m wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one, OK?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): Is it made in Mexico?HUCKABEE: I don\u2019t know.(UNKNOWN): Where\u2019s it made? Is it made in China?(UNKNOWN): Is it made in China or Mexico?HUCKABEE: I have no idea.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Such a nasty \u2014 such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.HUCKABEE: You\u2019re welcome.(LAUGHTER)Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. I\u2019ve spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.(APPLAUSE)You want to talk about what we\u2019re going to be up against next year? I\u2019m the only guy on this stage \u2014 you know, everybody has an \u201conly guy\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m the only guy this; I\u2019m the only guy that.\u201d Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.Somebody says \u201cI\u2019m a fighter.\u201d Well, I want to know, did you win? Well, I did. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I\u2019m standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I think that ought to be worth something.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.CHRISTIE: John, I\u2019ll tell you something. You want to talk about moral authority. Let\u2019s talk about something that happened this week in the news. You know, the FBI director, the president\u2019s appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they\u2019re afraid to enforce the law. And he says, the president\u2019s appointee, that crime is going up because of this.And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Does he stand up for law enforcement? No, he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people. This president has failed, and when I\u2019m in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States. That\u2019s real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.Don\u2019t forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.EPPERSON: Thank you, John.Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees. But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan.That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy.Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers?FIORINA: No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse. And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits. But honestly, if you\u2019re a small business owner today you are being crushed. We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. How great is that? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.They are refusing to...EPPERSON: So you wouldn\u2019t agree \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that?FIORINA: I think it\u2019s a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k). The point I\u2019m making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up \u2014 retirement plans. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...EPPERSON: Thank you very much.FIORINA: ... The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...EPPERSON: Thank you, the rules say one minute.FIORINA: ... The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.EPPERSON: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you.I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich.Most people can\u2019t get a college degree without going into debt. Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back.This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults. That\u2019s billion with a b.What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won\u2019t feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?Well, first of all, in Ohio we\u2019re changing the whole system. Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or \u2014 graduates or completes a course.Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. And let me give you an example. Universities today have so many non-academic assets. At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn\u2019t be in the parking lot business. They shouldn\u2019t be in the ding business, they shouldn\u2019t be in the dorm business.And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.This is a big moral issue in America. Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice. And people can learn it through public service.EPPERSON: Thank you, thank you.BUSH: We don\u2019t need the federal government to be involved in this at all.QUICK: Higher education is the example...BUSH: We don\u2019t need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there\u2019s accountability, just as John said. Let the states do this. You\u2019ll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won\u2019t in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.It\u2019s always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government. It is broke, it is not working.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year. But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that\u2019s out of your control. Isn\u2019t that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such?BUSH: Well, first of all, I\u2019m 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.QUINTANILLA: I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.BUSH: Gronkowski is still going strong. I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week. So I\u2019m doing great. But we\u2019re not gambling.And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation. Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all. And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.If they can\u2019t regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit. And there should be some regulation. I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?(LAUGHTER)We have \u2014 wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. We have people out of work. We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. And we\u2019re talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: How about this? How about we get the government to do what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families. Enough on fantasy football. Let people play, who cares?(CROSSTALK)QUICK: I want to go back, if I can, to the issue of...(CROSSTALK)QUICK: I want to go back, if I may, to the... HARWOOD: Governor Christie, you\u2019ve said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: \u201cThe question is, what do we do to deal with it?\u201d.So what do we do?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, what we don\u2019t do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: What should we do?CHRISTIE: What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy. I\u2019ve laid out...HARWOOD: You mean government?CHRISTIE: No, John. John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?(LAUGHTER)How are we going to do this?(APPLAUSE)Because, I\u2019ve got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you\u2019re doing is called rude. So...(LAUGHTER)We\u2019ve laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy. I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we\u2019re talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.Why? Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely. But also where it\u2019s affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they\u2019re already sending there.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Becky.QUICK: Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan. He warned that it would lead to socialism. Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?PAUL: The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government? And what distributes goods better? It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.Is there an area for a safety net? Can you have Medicare or Social Security? Yes. But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn\u2019t do a very good job at it.The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000. But the average person takes out about $350,000. We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.When people ask me, whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money? And I say, look, it\u2019s not Republicans\u2019 fault, it\u2019s not Democrats\u2019 fault, it\u2019s your grandparents\u2019 fault for having too many damn kids.(LAUGHTER)After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers. Now we\u2019re having smaller families. We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.It\u2019s not working. I have a bill to fix Medicare. I\u2019ve a bill to fix Social Security. For both of them you have to gradually raise the age. If you\u2019re not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you\u2019re not willing to gradually raise the age, you\u2019re not serious about fixing either one of them.QUICK: Senator, thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Becky, may I...QUINTANILLA: This is the\u2014 well, we\u2019re going to take a break. We want to save time for closing statements after the break.So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and we\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)QUICK: Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security. Your time, sir.HUCKABEE: Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we don\u2019t address what\u2019s costing so much, we can\u2019t throw enough money at this. And it\u2019s why I\u2019ve continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. We don\u2019t have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio \u2014 when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didn\u2019t spend any. We\u2019ve saved billions of dollars.You want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you\u2019ve fixed America, its economy and you\u2019ve made people\u2019s lives a heck of a lot better.BUSH: Becky \u2014QUICK: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: \u2014 the governor\u2019s absolutely right. But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security. We can\u2019t just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there\u2019ll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.HARWOOD: Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don\u2019t have to be touched. Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Yes, it\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic. We\u2019re going to bring jobs back from Japan, we\u2019re going to bring jobs back from China, we\u2019re going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they\u2019re moving it to Mexico.We\u2019re going to bring jobs and manufacturing back. We\u2019re going to cut costs. We\u2019re going to save Social Security, and we\u2019re going to save Medicare.(UNKNOWN): Governor, you just heard him.BUSH: You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don\u2019t receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.And make sure you enhance savings in the private market. The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up. It took \u2014 it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k). Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.KASICH: John.BUSH: But the idea that you can\u2019t \u2014 that you\u2019re just gonna grow your way out of this \u2014 I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you\u2019re gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.(UNKNOWN): Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds?KASICH: I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.And so much of what we did \u2014 to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups \u2014 can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare. We can make a stronger program. But I agree with Jeb, you can\u2019t just do this by growing the economy. You can\u2019t grow your way out of demographics.But we can give people better health care. And finally, on health care, why don\u2019t we start treating \u2014 keep giving...QUICK: Governor.KASICH: ...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they\u2019re sick?QUICK: Governor, thank you.Senator Paul, let\u2019s go back to you. Do these solutions sound like they work?PAUL: Say again?QUICK: Do these solutions sound like they would work?PAUL: You can\u2019t do nothing. And that\u2019s what I hear from some people, \u201cwe\u2019ll do nothing and it will just be fixed.\u201d That\u2019s absurd, and I think people who don\u2019t want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, \u201csomething has to change,\u201d are missing the boat here.The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question. It\u2019s the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security. You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there\u2019s not enough money.It isn\u2019t \u201cI put money in, I\u2019m getting it back.\u201d There is no money, it\u2019s a stack of paper. There is no money in the Social Security account. There is no money in the Medicare account. There\u2019s only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation\u2019s not big enough to pay it.(CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): ...to deal with this. We did it 200 days ago.HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. I\u2019ve got a question for \u2014 for Dr. Carson.CARSON: About Medicare?HARWOOD: Yes. You\u2019ve said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea. Explain how that would work, exactly.CARSON: Well, first of all the \u2014 the plan gives people the option of \u2014 of opting out. But I think they will see a very good option here. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. And there are 48 million people involved \u2014 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.Divide that out. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.And that\u2019s really a theme of a lot of the things that I\u2019m talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, \u201cintellect,\u201d in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. This is a country that is of, for and by the people.QUICK: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Governor?CHRISTIE: And \u2014 and \u2014 and I \u2014 you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don\u2019t need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear from Hillary Clinton \u2014 and I\u2019ve already heard from her \u2014 is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that\u2019s gonna solve the problem.What we know is we\u2019re living longer. That\u2019s a blessing. It\u2019s a blessing that we\u2019re living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you\u2019ve done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they\u2019re gonna give it back to you later? Or would you rather take less later on?QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio...HARWOOD: Governor, do you also think that...QUINTANILLA: ...yeah, I just wanted (inaudible).HARWOOD: ...that Dr. Carson\u2019s right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts?RUBIO: No. No. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson\u2019s ideas are good ideas. They\u2019re not my ideas, and I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all of them.But this is what you\u2019re seeing in the Republican debate that you didn\u2019t see in that Democrat debate.You didn\u2019t see it for a minute. You didn\u2019t see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that\u2019s civil and smart and that\u2019s trying to help to inform the voter out there.What you saw was a parade of, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this for free; I\u2019ll give you that for free.\u201dLet me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they\u2019re coming to you to pay for it. And that\u2019s why I think these ideas up here are great, and that\u2019s what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: I want to give you 30 seconds here.RUBIO: I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing. And that is that one of the things you\u2019re watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue. The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates. The Democrats can\u2019t even come up with one.And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it\u2019s important because they\u2019re going to demagogue what we\u2019re saying here tonight. Everyone up here tonight that\u2019s talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we\u2019re all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. I\u2019m against anything that\u2019s bad for my mother.(LAUGHTER)So, we\u2019re talking about \u2014 we\u2019re talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that\u2019s very reasonable. And it\u2019s not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.FIORINA: John, I \u2014 if I \u2014 a lot of people have jumped in here. I\u2019d like to jump in. A lot of people have jumped in here.HARWOOD: Mrs. Fiorina, we\u2019re right at the end of our time.FIORINA: I understand.HARWOOD: You all wanted us to limit (inaudible).All right. Go ahead.FIORINA: I would just say that...(LAUGHTER)... I would just say this, we\u2019ve heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said. Every election we talk about this. Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform. It never happens.I would like to start with a basic. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. It\u2019s kind of basic. There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we\u2019re going to spend year after year after year.My point is this. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics. And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable. So let\u2019s start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.HARWOOD: We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece. We\u2019re going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.PAUL: Liberty thrives when government is small. I want a government so small I can barely see it. I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper. I think, though, government is too big now. And what you\u2019re going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.This is extraordinary. It\u2019s extraordinarily wrong. You\u2019ll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.HARWOOD: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I want to talk to the folks at home. I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you? Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money? Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America\u2019s future?I\u2019ve got one more question for you then. Are you serious about this election? Because if you are, you need to elect someone who\u2019s deadly serious about changing this culture. I am deadly serious about changing this culture. I changed it in New Jersey. I\u2019m deadly serious about doing this job the right way.I\u2019m prepared. I\u2019m tested. I\u2019m ready. And I want to make this our government. For the people who say we can\u2019t do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington. The natural next question is who actually has done so. Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party? When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.If people are promising they\u2019re going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America. Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator.Mrs. Fiorina?FIORINA: You know, every election we hear a lot of talk. We hear a lot of good plans. We hear actually a lot of good intentions. But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed. What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. That\u2019s how you go from secretary to CEO. You lead and you produce results. I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton\u2019s worst nightmare. And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina. I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton. And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.HARMAN: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.Dr. Carson?CARSON: I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. And, this is what I am finding throughout America.People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. We used to win, we don\u2019t win anymore. We lose on trade. We lose with ISIS. We lose with one of the worst deals I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated of any kind, that\u2019s our recent catastrophe with Iran. We don\u2019t win.Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad. I went out and said, it\u2019s ridiculous. Nobody \u2014 I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours. It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.We called Ben, he was with me 100%. We called in, we said, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re not doing it. They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn\u2019t be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, I\u2019ll do that with the country. We will make America great again. And, thank you everybody. Just for the record.HARWOOD: Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Senator Rubio?TRUMP: That\u2019s not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right.MALE: Thank you.HARWOOD: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: You know, America doesn\u2019t owe me anything. I have a debt to America I\u2019ll never repay. This isn\u2019t just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream, although, it\u2019s built on the universal dream of a better life.The fact that it\u2019s happened for so many people here throughout our history, that\u2019s what makes us special. But, now for millions of Americans, it\u2019s slipping away. And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. Because we can\u2019t just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.And, that\u2019s why tonight I\u2019m asking you for your vote.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator. Governor Bush?BUSH: America\u2019s at a crossroads. The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse. I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee. I will do so in a way that will bring people together. We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that\u2019s exactly what I will do.Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again. Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again. I know we can do this because we\u2019re still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we\u2019re the players. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. And, sometimes we\u2019re held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there\u2019s something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.I\u2019ve got five grandkids. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, \u201cHere you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. Good luck making something out of this mess.\u201dAnd, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we\u2019re here, and hopefully you\u2019ll know we\u2019re not here for ourselves. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. I know this, I certainly am.HARWOOD: Thank you...HUCKABEE: ...Thank you.HARWOOD: Governor Kasich?KASICH: I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, \u201cCan I still be idealistic?\u201dI said, absolutely, you can still change the world. And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you\u2019ve changed the world. Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I\u2019ll tell you another problem. We need to rebuild our families. We need to have stronger families. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. And God bless America.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.QUINTANILLA: That concludes tonight\u2019s debate. On behalf of my colleagues Becky Quick, John Harwood, Sharon Epperson, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, we\u2019d like to our host, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Republican National Committee, the candidates and, of course, tonight\u2019s audience.CNBC\u2019s Kelly Evans and Joe Kernan pick up our continuing coverage.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Palace Banquet for Xi Jinping, a Snub From Prince Charles", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prince has not discussed his decision to skip the banquet on Tuesday night, but he is known to be close to the Dalai Lama and has previously snubbed other events involving China.While there will be demonstrations targeting Mr. Xi from human rights groups, it is highly unlikely that he will face any public criticism from British officials.After Mr. Cameron met with the Dalai Lama in 2012, China responded with a deep freeze in relations, and since then, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne have labored to restore warmer ties. Mr. Cameron has even named one of China\u2019s top businessmen Jack Ma, the Alibaba founder, as an official adviser on business, Downing Street said Monday. Mr. Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman, Helen Bower, told reporters that the two would meet later Monday, only hours before Mr. Xi arrived in Britain.Washington has been troubled by the seemingly uncritical approach to China and the embrace of Chinese technology by its closest ally, but American criticism so far has been limited to sniping \u201con background\u201d by unnamed diplomats.Mr. Cameron\u2019s office has defended this week\u2019s state visit, saying Monday that no topic was off limits, including \u201chuman rights and cybersecurity.\u201dMs. Bower said: \u201cBy developing a strong and engaged approach based on a constructive engagement we are able to raise issues on which we differ frankly, and to do so with mutual respect. We will take this approach this week, and nothing is off the table.\u201dMr. Cameron and crucial cabinet ministers will hold talks with Mr. Xi and Chinese officials on Wednesday that will focus on energy and trade, to be followed by a news conference, but British officials on Monday could not confirm that Mr. Xi would attend or take questions from British journalists at any stage.There will be further private talks, focusing more on foreign policy, over dinner on Thursday at the prime minister\u2019s official country residence, Chequers.The visit is expected to be marked by the signing of major contracts or commitments for China to invest in Britain\u2019s nuclear-power industry and even for the Chinese to build a nuclear power plant in Essex. The Chinese would be minority shareholders in both deals and would supply the design for the Essex plant.That has raised concerns over cybersecurity and energy independence, as well as doubts about relatively untested Chinese nuclear technology, even if it is built under British regulation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Greek Tax Official Is Dismissed", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The Greek government on Thursday dismissed the country\u2019s top tax official, saying she was not fulfilling her duty to aggressively collect taxes and fight tax evasion.The firing of the official, Katerina Savvaidou, the head of a supposedly independent public revenue authority, came at a sensitive moment in the country\u2019s effort to mount an economic comeback and live up to the conditions of its international bailout program.The government is eager to begin receiving payments from the 86 billion euro, or $97.6 billion, bailout program it agreed to this summer with its eurozone creditors. Disbursement of small slices of that money is contingent on the creditors\u2019 assessment of the progress of the country\u2019s economic overhaul measures. Greece\u2019s notoriously porous tax collection system and high level of tax evasion are parts of the economy that creditors have demanded be fixed.Despite the government\u2019s stated reason for dismissing Ms. Savvaidou, it was too early to tell whether Greece\u2019s creditors might nonetheless see her firing as an unwelcome political encroachment on what is supposed to be an independent agency.\u201cWe are definitely following the situation closely, but we have no comment to make at this stage,\u201d Annika Breidthardt, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said during a daily news briefing in Brussels on Thursday. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, helps monitor the Greek bailout.Ms. Savvaidou, who was appointed in June 2014 by the previous, conservative-led coalition, has lately been engaged in a public dispute with the left-leaning government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who was recently re-elected on a pledge to meet the conditions set by the country\u2019s creditors.The country\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, sought Ms. Savvaidou\u2019s resignation last week, after a prosecutor charged her with breach of duty for granting Greek television stations additional time to pay a tax on advertising revenue. She is also being investigated in relation to a decision to review a \u20ac78 million fine on a Greek company.Olga Gerovasili, a government spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that the Greek cabinet decided \u201cunanimously\u201d to dismiss Ms. Savvaidou. \u201cIn such difficult times for Greek society, for the Greek people, it is not acceptable for a public functionary to operate against the public interest,\u201d she said.Ms. Savvaidou had refused to step down, contending that her actions were not illegal.She also cited the independence of the agency she led, the secretariat for public revenue, which was set up in 2012 under the conservative-led coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras at the behest of Greece\u2019s creditors to stop political meddling in the country\u2019s tax administration.Speaking by telephone, Ms. Savvaidou said on Thursday that she had not been informed about the decision by the government. \u201cI heard about it on television,\u201d she said.In a written statement a few hours later, Ms. Savvaidou said that she had fulfilled her duties \u201cto the full\u201d and that extending a deadline for the payment of taxes was \u201ca standard practice in administration,\u201d not an offense.Ms. Gerovasili, the government spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the government would not accept \u201ccertain companies that were given special treatment under previous governments, and which constituted the core of vested interests, being favored again.\u201dShe did not name the companies. But the Tsipras government has pledged to break the ties among the political system, media organizations and Greek oligarchs. On Saturday, the Greek Parliament is scheduled to vote on legislation that paves the way for a new policy for issuing broadcasting licenses, a step vaunted by the government as the first step to establishing a truly independent media.Ms. Savvaidou\u2019s statement accused Ms. Gerovasili of \u201cpre-empting the judicial verdict\u201d by accusing her of granting favors to companies. The statement said Ms. Gerovasili had made \u201can unprecedented intervention\u201d in the independence of the tax authority and Greek justice.Ms. Savvaidou\u2019s predecessor, Haris Theoharis, quit last spring after political pressure and accusations he was \u201cmismanaging\u201d his role.No details were given regarding a successor to Ms. Savvaidou. A government official said that a \u201csenior official in the general secretariat\u201d would take over temporarily until a permanent replacement was appointed.Mr. Tsipras is preparing for a visit by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is widely regarded as a staunch ally of Greece and a counterweight to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her strict prescription of budgetary austerity.Mr. Hollande, who arrived in the Greek capital on Thursday evening for a two-day visit, was expected to urge the country to stay the course on overhauls and to encourage French investment in Greece.He is traveling with a large delegation of French government officials and entrepreneurs. In an interview with the center-right daily Kathimerini, Mr. Hollande said, \u201cI am coming to Greece to express France\u2019s support, but also to send a message, particularly to French companies: Come and invest in Greece.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Also, fees and payments under the Affordable Care Act that took effect in 2015 helped increase federal collections.The administration cheered the figures as vindication of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic policies and as proof of the resurgence he set in motion after taking office during the depths of the recession.Mr. Lew, in a letter to lawmakers hours before the deficit numbers were released, moved up by two days his initial estimate of when the statutory borrowing limit would be reached. By Nov. 3, he said, the government would have to resort to \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to meet federal obligations.Fiscal hawks called the deficit numbers a positive sign, but they cautioned that the improvement would probably be fleeting. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that deficits will begin to rise again in 2017 if fiscal policies are not overhauled.Maya MacGuineas, the leader of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, called Thursday\u2019s report \u201cgood news,\u201d adding, \u201cNow the bad news: This may well be the lowest it will be for a long time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nashville\u2019s Skyline Being Reshaped by Building Boom", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet8 PhotosNASHVILLE \u2014 A powerful surge in construction is reshaping the physical character and economy of this 236-year-old river city, and fueling a deepening public conversation about essential civic values that many residents worry could be lost.More than 100 new projects, together valued at more than $2 billion, are underway in Nashville or planned to start next year, according to city figures. Most of the big projects \u2014 four hotels, five office buildings and eight high-rise residential towers with a total value of $1.5 billion \u2014 are in the downtown core, a number of them rising on former parking lots, according to the Nashville Downtown Partnership, a business development group.These include a 30-story, $220 million office building under construction on Fourth Avenue that will serve as the new headquarters of Bridgestone Americas, the United States division of Bridgestone, the world\u2019s largest tire and rubber company. Under construction nearby is 222 Second Avenue S, a 25-story, $100 million, 350,000-square-foot building with 25,000 square feet of retail space.So many construction cranes are operating in downtown Nashville that they appear on the skyline as a flock of big birds, their extended beaks tugging at steel cables. A 454-room, 27-story, $120 million Westin is one of the high-rise hotels under construction. Just beyond downtown is OneCity, a $400 million mixed use project under construction that encompasses a million square feet of office space, 120,000 square feet of retail space, a 170-room hotel and up to 600 apartments.Even Music Row, the renowned neighborhood of recording studios and understated 20th-century music industry office buildings, has been affected. At the center of the temperate enclave, which once was set apart from the escalating construction clamor, is a 96,000-square-foot, five-story, $31 million office building nearing completion that will serve music production companies and talent representatives, including Sesac, a performing rights group that is moving from its old headquarters a block away.Never has this southern city of 660,000 residents experienced such a swarm of new projects, said Richard C. Bernhardt, who recently retired as director of the city\u2019s planning department. The city, which spent all of the 20th century spreading out horizontally in low-rise apartment, retail, hotel and office buildings, is now going vertical. Nashville\u2019s disparate, uneven skyline, highlighted by the twin spires of AT&T\u2019s 33-story, 617-foot-tall \u201cBatman\u201d building, which was finished in 1994, is about to add enough height, complexity and sharp angles to rival downtown Charlotte or Denver.The shift in urban design responds to Nashville\u2019s consistent attractiveness as a place to live and work, especially to young professionals and musicians, and to the millennial generation\u2019s allegiance to active, walkable urban neighborhoods, Mr. Bernhardt said. Nashville has grown by an average of 11,000 residents annually this decade, more than three times the average annual growth during the last decade. One critical move Nashville made in response to the growth, and to encourage more new construction, was adjusting the city\u2019s zoning code to enable builders to combine residential, office, retail and entertainment spaces in their projects. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is the result of 20 years of preparation,\u201d Mr. Bernhardt said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort to move the city forward, to make Nashville a more attractive place for investment.\u201dAnother significant step the city took was to invest in public parks. An 11-acre riverfront park opened this year to tie Nashville more closely to the Cumberland River. And Centennial Park, Nashville\u2019s 112-year-old central park, is undergoing an extensive renovation to restore its broad lawns, walking paths and gardens.\u201cMost people will tell you they like what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Sylvia Rapoport, a Nashville native and president of the Conservancy for the Parthenon and Centennial Park, which helped Metro Parks fund the $9 million restoration. \u201cThere\u2019s an excitement about Nashville that we\u2019ve never had. Young people are coming here to settle.\u201dNashville\u2019s unleashed growth, though, has stirred civic concerns about how to solve the region\u2019s swelling traffic problem, and about the city\u2019s identity. City leaders and many residents agree that Nashville is in dire need of an improved transit system. Mayor Megan Barry, who took office in late September, campaigned on a platform that included promoting more bus and rail options.The transition to a city with livelier street life and much taller buildings has also unnerved some residents and spurred a discussion about Nashville\u2019s distinctive way of life.\u201cThe flavor of Nashville is changing,\u201d said Bob Bernstein, the founder and owner of Bongo Productions, who moved from Chicago in 1988 and owns a collection of popular Nashville restaurants and coffee shops. \u201cReal estate prices, rents, they are going nuts. New, shiny stuff is happening all around. People who don\u2019t own real estate, small operators, are being priced out of businesses they built.\u201d\u201cThe city is on fire,\u201d added Richard Lloyd, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThere\u2019s excitement about the big city thing. But there\u2019s anxiety, too. Some of it has to do with whether we are losing some part of our soul. Nashville always had this tension. It wants to be taken seriously, be big time. But it doesn\u2019t want to lose the homeyness.\u201dStill, in a departure from the polemical debates about growth in other American cities, which typically involve either unleashing developers or putting up high barriers of civic opposition, Nashville\u2019s pursuit of a much denser urban experience is being undertaken with a kind of pragmatic wariness.That approach worked for Bridgestone Americas, which settled in Nashville in 1992 and now employs 1,100 people in a leased office tower near the airport. Facing the expiration of its lease in 2017, the company began a national search in 2012 for new space that could have led to Bridgestone\u2019s leaving Nashville. By November 2014, when Bridgestone announced that it would lease an angular glass and steel tower developed by the Raleigh-based Highwoods Properties, Nashville\u2019s downtown makeover was well underway.In 2013, Nashville opened Music City Center, its $623 million, 1.2 million-square-foot convention center on Fifth Avenue. Nearby, in April, the city opened a new 8,500-seat, $47 million baseball stadium for the Nashville Sounds, the AAA affiliate of the Oakland Athletics.\u201cWe looked closely at a lot of cities while we considered our move,\u201d said Christine Karbowiak, the chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Bridgestone Americas, who is supervising the company\u2019s relocation. \u201cWe chose Nashville. There\u2019s a certain vibe downtown now that will be very appealing to current and future employees.\u201dTo some extent, Nashville can thank the commercial and cultural success of The Gulch, once a 60-acre stretch of vacant parcels and light industrial buildings along the CSX rail yard downtown that MarketStreet Enterprises, a local developer, turned into one of the city\u2019s most active neighborhoods.The company started the project in 1999 with land purchases. In 2001, the city approved its master development plan. In 2008, MarketStreet Enterprises completed the 22-story Icon in the Gulch, a 418-unit residential building that included space for retail businesses and restaurants. Similar high-rise residential buildings followed, which provided the customer base for the new neighborhood\u2019s trendy retail businesses and popular restaurants.The project\u2019s newest phase is office construction. In May, MarketStreet Enterprises opened Gulch Crossing, an eight-story, 205,000-square-foot, $78.5 million office building with 16,000 square feet of street-level retail space. A few blocks away, Eakin Partners is building a 15-story, 285,000-square-foot, $95 million office tower with 26,000 square feet of retail space. MarketStreet Enterprises, which estimates that it has built 70 percent of the Gulch, also has a joint venture with AJ Capital Partners and the Berger Company to construct a 12-story, 224-room Thompson Nashville Hotel in the Gulch.To date, MarketStreet Enterprises has spent $750 million to construct 460,000 square feet of office space, 280,000 square feet of retail space and 1,480 residences, according to company figures. \u201cWe needed residential and retail to get people into the area,\u201d said Jay Turner, managing director of MarketStreet Enterprises. \u201cNow we\u2019re into the office phase. We\u2019re a local firm and we\u2019re pretty patient. We wait for the right signals. We didn\u2019t want to just create a big neighborhood from scratch in three years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau, Son of a Canadian Leader, Follows His Own Path to Power", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMan in the NewsOTTAWA \u2014 When Justin Trudeau moves into the prime minister\u2019s official residence, it will be a homecoming. His parents lived there, in the gray stone house at 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, when he was born on Christmas Day in 1971.And there are many easy parallels to draw between him and his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who led the country for 15 years beginning in 1968.Start with the superficial: good looks, rugged athleticism, glamorous wife, rapturous fans. More substantially: unusual outspokenness, reputations as agents of change, a sharp upward trajectory in the Liberals\u2019 fortunes on each man\u2019s watch.Without doubt, the good luck to be born with Pierre\u2019s surname was a big help.But Justin Trudeau is no dynast who slipped effortlessly into a family political machine. He did not even enter politics until 18 years after his father gave it up, and seven years after his father\u2019s death. He built his own cadre of advisers, mostly from his own generation. And at key points in his career, he chose more difficult roads \u2014 partly, it appears, to show he had not been handed a life in politics on a platter.\u201cI do this not out of a sense of historical ambition or drive: \u2018My father did it, so I have to,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trudeau said during a lengthy interview in 2013, shortly before he became the Liberal Party leader. \u201cNo, I do this because I think I have something to offer. If it turns out that I don\u2019t, that\u2019s just fine, too. But I\u2019m fairly confident that I have something to offer that this country needs more of right now, which is an antidote to the kind of cynicism which is dominating too much of politics around the world.\u201dThe novelty of a sitting prime minister with young children made Justin Trudeau and his two brothers celebrities from birth, but Pierre Trudeau and his wife, Margaret, who came from a prominent political family herself, tried to give the boys some semblances of normalcy. The children rode the regular bus to public school (albeit with an unmarked car full of bodyguards right behind), and they mixed in class with children from a poor area of Ottawa as well as their own affluent neighbors.When he was 7 or 8, Mr. Trudeau recalled, he overheard his parents giving away the secret of Santa Claus, and the next morning, he told a group of his friends in the schoolyard.\u201cMost of the kids ran off crying,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one turned to me and said: \u2018I know. I\u2019ve always known. My mom told me when I was old enough to understand, because she couldn\u2019t afford presents for me.\u2019 \u201dMr. Trudeau said he had immediately thought of the \u201cmountain of presents under the tree at 24 Sussex,\u201d many of them sent by ambassadors to Canada. \u201cThat was one of those moments when I realized, \u2018Man, I\u2019m very, very lucky, and it has nothing to do with the quality of the person I am or what kind of material stuff we have,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBecause this kid, Mark, was one of my best friends.\u201dThe media spotlight that fell on his childhood also obsessively documented the breakdown of his parents\u2019 marriage, a product of Margaret Trudeau\u2019s struggles with mental illness. When his father quit public life, the family moved to Montreal, and the retired prime minister led the life of a single parent, though an affluent one.Both father and son came to elective politics relatively late in life, but Pierre Trudeau had already been active on the public stage at several important moments in Quebec\u2019s history. Notably, he supported a 1949 strike by asbestos miners, a turning point in the \u201cquiet revolution\u201d against the province\u2019s entrenched elite of Catholic clerics and Anglophone businessmen.Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party won a sweeping victory in Canada\u2019s national election on Monday. Here is a look at how the 43-year-old father of three worked his way to becoming Canada\u2019s second-youngest prime minister.Justin Trudeau studied French and English literature at McGill University in Montreal, but after that, as he acknowledged, his path was a slightly aimless one. He went with friends on a backpacking trip around the world. He thought about law school, then returned to McGill to study education, only to drop out and move to British Columbia, his mother\u2019s home province, where he taught snowboarding and worked as a nightclub bouncer \u2014 an unlikely job, perhaps, for someone with his slender build.\u201cI was the one they\u2019d send in to defuse a situation and escort someone out, because I was diplomatic,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt physically threatened by anyone. I don\u2019t have a fear gene, I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\u201dHe returned to education and taught in both a public high school and a private prep school in Vancouver, an experience that he said confirmed his belief in the public system.At the prep school, \u201cthere were parents who spent a lot of time intimidating the teachers, because they make so much more money than them, and the kids were catching on to that and not respecting the teachers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something, I think, unhealthy about that level of privilege.\u201dTwo tragedies returned him to the public gaze. His brother Michel was killed in an avalanche in 1998, prompting a public outpouring of sympathy for the family. Then, when his devastated father died two years later, Mr. Trudeau delivered a eulogy that was broadcast live.Rather than a safe Liberal seat, Mr. Trudeau ran in 2007 for one in downtown Montreal that was known for favoring Quebec-separatist candidates. He won, and has widened his margin of victory in each election since then.Mr. Trudeau showed a penchant for unscripted remarks that could be refreshing or embarrassing. When Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canadian fighter jets would join the American-led campaign against the Islamic State militant group, Mr. Trudeau responded with a vulgar metaphor that many called juvenile. And he raised eyebrows in 2013 when he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a level of admiration I actually have for China: Their basic dictatorship is actually allowing them to turn their economy around on a dime.\u201dOpponents have pounced on his miscues and tried to paint him as na\u00efve and ill-prepared. But Bob Rae, the interim leader of the Liberals whom Mr. Trudeau succeeded, said the occasional verbal blunders did not reflect Mr. Trudeau\u2019s true nature. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily come to his conclusions immediately or grammatically,\u201d Mr. Rae said, but he is \u201ca thoughtful, intelligent guy.\u201dMr. Rae said many people mistook Mr. Trudeau\u2019s consensual approach to politics for weakness or indiscipline. \u201cYou don\u2019t become the leader of a major party by just being a nice guy,\u201d he said.The circle of aides around him began as his friends. He met Gerald Butts, now his principal adviser, when they both studied at McGill. He grew up with Dominic LeBlanc, the son of one of Pierre Trudeau\u2019s cabinet ministers and now his closest ally in Parliament. Anna Gainey, the party president, is another old friend.For all that his family connections have done for his political career, though, Mr. Trudeau said it had worked the other way, too.\u201cThere have been people out there who love me because of my father; there are people out there who hate me because of my father,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to learn to not entirely disregard that, but understand that either side of those is not based in a reality that I can use as an anchor for who or what I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "One State\u2019s Struggle to Make Ends Meet: Why Illinois Is Without a Budget", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Illinois, notorious for its debt and dysfunction, is poised to begin its fifth month without a state budget, the consequence of a long-simmering ideological and political dispute between Gov. Bruce Rauner, the Republican who took office in January, and the Democrats who hold a supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature.Mr. Rauner has tied passage of the budget to changes in workers\u2019 compensation and collective bargaining rights for unionized public employees, measures that he says will help revive the Illinois economy and bring in much-needed revenue. Democratic Party leaders in the state reject those suggestions, saying that the governor is making demands that are unrelated to the budget.Some residents are losing patience, directing their anger at lawmakers and calling on state leaders to end the stalemate. Even members of Mr. Rauner\u2019s own party are questioning his handling of the situation.He added, \u201cChange causes pain.\u201dHere are a few things to know about the state\u2019s budget struggle:Social service organizations that have contracts with the state, and the low-income populations they serve, may be suffering the most. Some nonprofits have not received money from the state since July 1 and say they have been forced to deplete their cash reserves and scale back services. Mark Mathews, the executive director of the Child Abuse Council in Moline, which provides counseling and visits homes of troubled families, said he had eliminated two staff positions and reduced one program\u2019s caseload by 40 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely damaging the not-for-profit agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been serving as many families. At-risk families aren\u2019t getting home visits or services. That\u2019s the tough thing.\u201dThe sheriff of Cook County, Thomas J. Dart, said that people who would normally be helped by nonprofits, like the homeless, have begun to show up at jail instead, in search of assistance. Nonprofits are cutting staff, and some could close if the impasse continues, he said.\u201cThese are folks who have missions to help the disadvantaged,\u201d Mr. Dart said. \u201cWhat was already difficult is becoming impossible.\u201dTim Carpenter, the Illinois director of the nonprofit Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, said law enforcement officials had seen the impact of the budget impasse in their communities. \u201cMental health services that aren\u2019t being funded, kids that aren\u2019t getting after-school programs,\u201d he said. \u201cPublic safety is being sacrificed.\u201dThe Illinois State Museum system is closed because of budget cuts. Last month, Jesse White, the secretary of state, said that his office was forced to cut costs by no longer sending out vehicle registration reminders in the mail, exposing millions of motorists to the annoyance and expense of potential late fees.And in a small twist of bad luck, the Illinois lottery has halted payments of more than $600 to its winners. One of them, Daniel Chasteen, who bought a winning ticket of $250,000 in July, has yet to be paid. In frustration, he joined a lawsuit against the lottery and its acting director in September.\u201cI was going to pay all my bills off,\u201d said Mr. Chasteen, a supervisor at a manufacturing plant. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll still get my money. It would be wrong if I didn\u2019t, because I won it fair and square. The people down in Springfield, they can\u2019t agree on anything. They just argue back and forth.\u201dDemocrats say that the governor\u2019s proposals are nonstarters and damaging to the middle class. Among them are measures to limit prevailing wages and cut down on eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation, changes that the governor says are reasonable and will stimulate economic growth.On Thursday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded $26.8 billion in the state\u2019s general obligation bonds, saying that Illinois\u2019s financial obligations leave the state \u201cmore vulnerable to the next economic downturn.\u201d A few days earlier, Fitch Ratings had downgraded Illinois\u2019s credit rating for the first time since Mr. Rauner took office in January, citing the budget fight and the state\u2019s high debt.Ms. Munger, the Republican comptroller, has publicly pushed for a resolution to the budget impasse and said that the state would not have enough cash to make a monthly $560 million payment to its pension funds in November. The scheduled payment in December could also be delayed, she said.Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rauner, cited a letter that the governor sent to legislative leaders on Friday, offering to host a public meeting on Nov. 18 to discuss the budget. \u201cThank you for your commitment to solving this impasse,\u201d he signed off.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s not necessarily the case with the Rolls-Royce Ghost. Those buying one might slide behind the heated wheel \u2014 or they may not. According to Rolls-Royce, half are looking to be driven, a statistic not shared with Corolla (or many cars for that matter).Rolls-Royce\u2019s 2015 models are Series II cars, a freshening of sorts. Perhaps you\u2019ve recognized that the statelier grille is now framed by LED headlamps. No? Chalk it up to rarity. Rolls-Royce builds only 4,000 cars a year in Goodwood, England. You may never see a Ghost in person.You\u2019ll remember the day you spy one. The Double R wheel hub logos do not spin while driving, staying properly upright for all to admire. The Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament tucks beneath the grille once the car is shut down, most likely to keep a kidnapping from occurring. Ghost remains regal, even without its grace.The rear tires and a 563 horsepower, 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12 engine, sourced from BMW, have the task of moving the 5,600-pound Ghost and do so with brute-force elegance. The silent rush to 60 miles an hour in 4.8 seconds is, well, ghostlike. The 8-speed gearbox uses GPS location information for more confident cog swaps. Concentrate hard and you may detect shifts. Probably not.Some cars have chassis that are solid as a safe. The Ghost feels like driving a vault. It is solid. It is heavy. It is the anti-Miata. Ghost remains composed in corners, but physics will not be denied. Rich with understeer, it\u2019s not eager to slice through curves.Where the Ghost fully delivers is comfort. This rolling enclave tames road imperfections like no other automobile. Fuel economy? If you must know, the Ghost gulps the premium stuff at an average of 15 miles per gallon.The cabin is a craftsman\u2019s showcase. If it looks like metal, it is. Door panel speakers have no trim rings; supple hide simply stops perfectly at their edge. Live in a soggy climate? There\u2019s built-in umbrella storage in the front doors, and 85 percent of the cars are bespoke, so feel free to match the umbrella panels to the paint color. Of course.Those who are driven rest in back seats that massage, cool and toast. Passengers are in full control with a second iDrive unit in the folding armrest. Watch a movie or read the owner\u2019s manual on the LCD screens in case you plan on driving yourself someday. Long wheelbase models offer even more legroom. Wood \u201cpicnic tables\u201d fold from the seat backs, begging for a Grey Poupon joke.The Ghost is a car for the 1 percent of the 1 percent, if even that. At $383,000 as tested, the Rolls was a rock star as I drove about for a few days. Fitting, because you need to be one, in any profession, to own a Ghost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CNBC May Be the Big Winner of the Next Republican Debate", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s new favorite reality TV show, the Republican presidential debate, returns on Wednesday. But political-minded viewers will be forgiven for having to consult their channel guides to find it.\u201cSomebody emailed me the other day and said there had been 441 questions in the presidential debates so far, and not one of them was about the debt ceiling,\u201d Becky Quick, a CNBC anchor who will serve as one of the debate moderators, said in an interview.She pored over the debate transcripts and confirmed it: Moderators had ignored the debt ceiling. And how did this make Ms. Quick feel?\u201cFantastic!\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our time.\u201dThe 26-year-old financial cable news channel, often played on mute on trading floors and in financial firms\u2019 offices (as well as in the lobby of CNBC\u2019s headquarters in northern New Jersey), will center the debate on its bread and butter: business, the economy, money. Ms. Quick, John Harwood and Carl Quintanilla are serving as the moderators. Jim Cramer, Sharon Epperson and Rick Santelli are expected to each get in a question or two.The debate is poised to shatter previous viewership records for the channel and provide it with some welcome news. Over the last decade, CNBC has confronted declining ratings and increased competition. Online services have neutralized the power of its stock updates, Fox Business debuted eight years ago, and Bloomberg Television has invested plenty to gain traction.Yet despite all of that, CNBC remains at the top when it comes to financial news on cable.Last year, CNBC had an average audience of 131,000 viewers, including on weekends, when it runs paid programming, down about half from its numbers in the throes of the 2008 financial crisis, according to Nielsen. (It did increase viewers from 2013 to 2014.)That may have been, in part, why the network announced last year that it would no longer use Nielsen ratings for its daytime hours. The network contends that its affluent audience cannot be tracked by Nielsen\u2019s household set meters; Brian Steel, a network spokesman, pointed to \u201ctrading floors, hotel rooms, corporate suites, restaurants and country clubs\u201d as places where viewers watch.And for the debate, CNBC is attracting unusually high levels of attention from advertisers.\u201cThis is a substantial, historic sort of one-off,\u201d said Mark Hoffman, the chairman of CNBC.The network has been asking for \u2014 and, in some cases, receiving \u2014 about $250,000 for 30-second commercial spots during the debate, according to an NBCUniversal executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That significantly exceeds what CNBC normally asks for in its prime-time hours.Though the debate will almost certainly set records for CNBC \u2014 its highest viewership came from Olympics coverage in 2002, when 3.9 million people tuned in \u2014 network executives are not anticipating numbers as high as Fox News (24 million viewers) or CNN (23 million) got for the Republican debates. CNBC\u2019s audience is decidedly more niche, and it is a less intuitive home for such an event \u2014 and the debate will also air opposite Game 2 of the World Series on Fox. The 2011 Republican debate on CNBC received 3.3 million viewers. (Fox Business will broadcast the next Republican debate, on Nov. 10.)The network is certainly familiar with the Republican candidate who will be center stage: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump has been a frequent guest on CNBC, and he used to appear in a regular segment called \u201cTrump Tuesdays\u201d on the channel\u2019s morning show \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d Another candidate, Carly Fiorina, used to be a CNBC contributor.\u201cThere are some people who have a business background, and they\u2019ll be the two who will be most well versed in this,\u201d Ms. Quick said. \u201cWe realize that walking into it. Look, Donald Trump knows taxes inside and out.\u201dMr. Harwood has been here before. He found himself at the center of one of the most memorable debate moments from the last presidential election cycle. During CNBC\u2019s broadcast of the Republican debate in November 2011, Rick Perry froze onstage when trying to name one of the three government agencies he proposed cutting. And that moment \u2014 punctuated by Mr. Perry\u2019s \u201cOops\u201d \u2014 almost did not happen.\u201cI was worried the thing was a little boring up until then,\u201d Mr. Harwood said. \u201cPerry starts doing that riff, he stops, and there was a moment when the audience was laughing and the whole thing was diffusing. Maria Bartiromo started to ask another question, and a producer, Sandy Cannold, came in my ear and said, \u2018Stay with this. Don\u2019t leave it.\u2019 That\u2019s when I asked him again, and it became clear it wasn\u2019t just a momentary funny thing.\u201dThose moments are pay dirt for moderators, but they are, by nature, unpredictable. CNBC\u2019s top priority, all the anchors said, will be to be substantive while keeping the financial jargon to a minimum.Or as Ms. Epperson, CNBC\u2019s personal finance correspondent, put it: \u201cThis is a CNBC debate that\u2019s not just for CNBC. It\u2019s not just for the people in our war room or for the people who watch us every day. It\u2019s for the electorate; it\u2019s for millions of people.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the Republican debate on the cable channel CNBC described the channel\u2019s average audience last year incorrectly in some editions. It was 131,000 viewers at any given moment during the day, not 131,000 per day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dark Vision From French Intellectuals", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 There\u2019s something very French about intellectuals weighing in on topical issues loudly and regularly. The latest twist is that they have taken over the political debate.From front pages to television talk shows, a few philosopher-pundits have taken center stage, defending their dark vision of a France in danger of losing its identity, sovereignty, culture \u2014 in short, its soul.A headline in the newspaper Le Monde questioned whether the intellectuals who share Mr. Zemmour\u2019s pessimism \u2014 including several prominent former leftists \u2014 aren\u2019t playing the game of the National Front, the far-right party that has capitalized on popular dissatisfaction with immigration, globalization and, notably, the European Union.Most vehemently deny any sympathy for the National Front \u2014 or any political party, for that matter. But the themes are similar, notably with respect to the European Union, which once promised to deliver a shared future to a continent scarred by war.Now, they say, that dream is dead, done in by repeated crises, a stagnant economy and a technocratic elite that is deaf to popular opinion.Sudhir Hazareesingh, an Oxford professor and author of \u201cHow the French Think,\u201d just published in the United States by Basic Books, dates the shift to 2005, when French voters rejected a new European constitution only to see the project move ahead anyway.\u201cUntil then, there used to be a constructive debate,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow only one side is audible. The other side is there, but we don\u2019t hear them because they don\u2019t want to engage.\u201dOther countries share a disillusion with the European project, but in France, the debate is shot through with a \u201csentiment underpinned by a fear of decline,\u201d Mr. Hazareesingh said.\u201cWhen the French become anxious, anything that represents change is experienced as something perilous,\u201d he said.He has characterized this trend as an intellectual retreat, both in time and in space, back to a vision of French \u201crepublican\u201d values of more than a century ago.One example is \u201cla\u00efcit\u00e9,\u201d the French version of secularism, now reinterpreted as a bulwark against the perceived threat of an increasingly multicultural society.Unlike French intellectuals of other periods, this group isn\u2019t trying to reach audiences outside the country. \u201cThere is a very Franco-centric dimension to their way of thinking,\u201d Mr. Hazareesingh said.The paradox is that these ubiquitous \u201cdeclinists\u201d \u2014 as Mr. Hazareesingh defines them \u2014 regularly characterize themselves as victims of \u201cla bien-pensance,\u201d the French equivalent of political correctness.They argue that any criticism of immigration policies is instantly branded as racist xenophobia, and any defense of French sovereignty is dismissed as nostalgia.But as Le Monde noted, the idea that their views are being ignored is misplaced.\u201cOn the right and on the left, \u2018la bien-pensance\u2019 is no longer the dominant discourse,\u201d read a recent headline in the newspaper. The reigning ideology in France today, the article said, is \u201cmore authoritarian than libertarian, more conservative than progressive.\u201dThis trend is happening against a backdrop of widespread dismay with a political class seen as incapable of dealing with popular concerns such as immigration or unemployment.These issues are real, and the intellectuals definitely have picked up on \u201csomething that is genuinely felt,\u201d Mr. Hazareesingh noted. The question is whether their solutions amount to a credible vision for France\u2019s future.Advertisement"}

And while it\u2019s perfectly obvious what Meyers is doing to De Niro \u2014 girlfriending him \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make the overhaul any less effective. The whole movie is about the subtle and obvious ways in which men have been overly sensitized and women made self-estranged through breadwinning. It\u2019s both a plaint against the present and a pining for the past, but also an acceptance that we are where we are.And where are we? On one hand: in another of Nancy Meyers\u2019s bourgeois pornographies. On the other: in the midst of a great cultural identity migration. Gender roles are merging. Races are being shed. In the last six years or so, but especially in 2015, we\u2019ve been made to see how trans and bi and poly-ambi-omni- we are. If Meyers is clued into this confusion, then you know it really has gone far, wide and middlebrow. We can see it in the instantly beloved hit \u2018\u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2019 about a family whose patriarch becomes a trans woman whose kids call her Moppa, or in the time we\u2019ve spent this year in televised proximity to Caitlyn Jenner, or in the browning of America\u2019s white founding fathers in the Broadway musical \u2018\u2018Hamilton,\u2019\u2019 or in the proliferating clones that Tatiana Maslany plays on \u2018\u2018Orphan Black,\u2019\u2019 which mock the idea of a true or even original self, or in Amy Schumer's comedic feminism, which reconsiders gender confusion: Do uncouthness, detachment and promiscuity make her a slut, or a man?We can see it in the recently departed half-hour sketch comedy \u2018\u2018Key & Peele,\u2019\u2019 which took race as a construct that could be reshuffled and remixed until it seemed to lose its meaning. The sitcom \u2018\u2018Black-ish\u2019\u2019 likewise makes weekly farcical discourse out of how much black identity has warped \u2014 and how much it hasn\u2019t \u2014 over 50 years and across three generations. \u2018\u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019\u2019 turns selfhood into a circus, introducing us to a lower-middle-class Native American teenager who eventually succeeds at becoming a rich white lady, and to other characters who try out new selves every 10 minutes, as if they\u2019re auditioning for \u2018\u2018Snapchat: The Musical.\u2019\u2019 Last month, Ryan Adams released a remake of Taylor Swift\u2019s album \u2018\u20181989,\u2019\u2019 song for song, as a rock record that combines a male voice with a perspective that still sounds like a woman\u2019s, like Lindsey Buckingham trying on Stevie Nicks\u2019s clothes. Dancing on the fringes of mainstream pop are androgynous black men like Le1f, Stromae and Shamir.What started this flux? For more than a decade, we\u2019ve lived with personal technologies \u2014 video games and social-media platforms \u2014 that have helped us create alternate or auxiliary personae. We\u2019ve also spent a dozen years in the daily grip of makeover shows, in which a team of experts transforms your personal style, your home, your body, your spouse. There are TV competitions for the best fashion design, body painting, drag queen. Some forms of cosmetic alteration have become perfectly normal, and there are shows for that, too. Our reinventions feel gleeful and liberating \u2014 and tied to an essentially American optimism. After centuries of women living alongside men, and of the races living adjacent to one another, even if only notionally, our rigidly enforced gender and racial lines are finally breaking down. There\u2019s a sense of fluidity and permissiveness and a smashing of binaries. We\u2019re all becoming one another. Well, we are. And we\u2019re not.Some people called her \u2018\u2018transracial.\u2019\u2019 Others found insult in her masquerade, particularly when the country\u2019s attention was being drawn, day after day, to how dangerous it can be to have black skin. The identities of the black men and women killed by white police officers and civilians, under an assortment of violent circumstances, remain fixed.But there was something oddly compelling about Dolezal, too. She represented \u2014 dementedly but also earnestly \u2014 a longing to transcend our historical past and racialized present. This is a country founded on independence and yet comfortable with racial domination, a country that has forever been trying to legislate the lines between whiteness and nonwhiteness, between borrowing and genocidal theft. We\u2019ve wanted to think we\u2019re better than a history we can\u2019t seem to stop repeating. Dolezal\u2019s unwavering certainty that she was black was a measure of how seriously she believed in integration: It was as if she had arrived in a future that hadn\u2019t yet caught up to her.January | Margaret Cho at the Golden GlobesThe Korean-American comic dressed up as a North Korean official. She crossed no color lines but was accused of racism.Before Obama ran for president, when we tended to talk about racial identity, we did so as the defense of a settlement. Black was understood to be black, nontransferably. Negro intellectuals \u2014 Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray and James Baldwin, for starters \u2014 debated strategies for equality and tolerance. Some of them asserted that to be black was also to be American, even if America begged to differ. For most of those many decades, blackness stood in opposition to whiteness, which folded its arms and said that was black people\u2019s problem. But Obama became everybody\u2019s problem. He was black. He was white. He was hope. He was apocalypse. And he brought a lot of anxiety into weird relief. We had never really had a white president until we had a black one.This radical hope, triggered by Obama, ushered in a period of bi- and transracial art \u2014 art that probed the possibility that we really had transcended race, but also ridiculed this hope with an acid humor. During Obama's past year in office, those works of art have taken on an even darker, more troubled tone as we keep looking around and seeing how little has really changed.When the Dolezal story broke, I was partway through Nell Zink\u2019s \u2018\u2018Mislaid,\u2019\u2019 one of the four new satirical novels of race I read this year \u2014 Jess Row\u2019s \u2018\u2018Your Face in Mine,\u2019\u2019 Paul Beatty\u2019s \u2018\u2018The Sellout\u2019\u2019 and Mat Johnson\u2019s \u2018\u2018Loving Day\u2019\u2019 were the others. (I also read Fran Ross\u2019s long-lost, recently reissued \u2018\u2018Oreo.\u2019\u2019) But Zink\u2019s was the only one that felt like an energy reading of Dolezal. Zink\u2019s white heroine, Peggy, has run off with her daughter, Mireille, and decided to take the birth certificate of a dead black girl named Karen Brown and use it for Mireille, while changing her own name to Meg.The next year, Karen was 4 years old going on 5 and still blond. Nonetheless registering her for first grade as a black 6-year-old was easy as pie.Maybe you have to be from the South to get your head around blond black people. Virginia was settled before slavery began, and it was diverse. There were tawny black people with hazel eyes. Black people with auburn hair, skin like butter and eyes of deep blue-green. Blond, blue-eyed black people resembling a recent chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.Zink\u2019s marveling description of what blackness looks like implies that it could welcome anyone. She draws a phenotypic loophole through which a sympathetic impostor or a straight-up cynic can pass.Each of these books wrestles with the fact of race while trying to present it as mutable, constructed, obscuring. In Beatty\u2019s novel, a young black farmer in modern Los Angeles reluctantly takes on a vulgar former TV minstrel star as his slave. Blackness, according to this book, is as much a scam as it is a cultural identity; the undercurrents of tragedy keep lapping at the harbor of farce. Row\u2019s novel is also a satire, but an eerily calm one in which a white man has \u2018\u2018racial reassignment\u2019\u2019 surgery and becomes black. Row, who like Zink is white, takes guilt to an astounding allegorical extreme: The surest cure for white oppression is to eliminate whiteness. Whatever else is going on with Dolezal psychologically, you can read into her proud reassignment a sense of shame.But racial transgression works the other way too. \u2018\u2018Hamilton\u2019\u2019 is a musical biography about the very white, very dead Alexander Hamilton, in which most of the cast is \u2018\u2018other,\u2019\u2019 including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s Nuyorican creator and star. Some of its audacity stems from the baldness of its political project: In changing the races of the founding fathers from white to brown, it pushes back against the currents of racial appropriation. It also infuses the traditional melodies of the American musical with so many genres of hip-hop and R & B, sometimes in a single number, that the songs themselves become something new. Political debates are staged as rap battles. Daveed Diggs\u2019s Thomas Jefferson becomes the best good thing that never happened at the Source Awards. Artistically, Miranda has created a great night out. Racially, the show tags the entertainment industry status quo with color. It\u2019s obviously musical theater. But damn if it\u2019s not graffiti too.Naturally, this new era has also agitated a segment of the populace that is determined to scrub the walls. That, presumably, is where Donald Trump comes in: as the presidential candidate for anyone freaked out by the idea of a show like \u2018\u2018Hamilton.\u2019\u2019 Trump is the pathogenic version of Obama, filling his supporters with hope based on a promise to rid the country of change. This incarnation of Trump appeared not long after Obama\u2019s election, determined to disprove the new president\u2019s American citizenship. On Trump\u2019s behalf, an entire wing of conservatism \u2014 the so-called birthers \u2014 devoted itself to the removal of a mask that Obama was never wearing. Part of Trump\u2019s appeal is his illusion of authenticity. His blustering candor has currency in a landscape of android candidates. Yet his magnetism resides in paranoia, the fear that since Obama\u2019s election ushered in this shifting, unstable climate of identity, the country has been falling apart.It\u2019s a paranoia that pop culture captured first: In the last six years, Hollywood has provided a glut of disaster spectacles, armageddon scenarios and White House sackings. But the USA Network\u2019s \u2018\u2018Mr. Robot,\u2019\u2019 which ended its first season last month, might have gotten at that sense of social collapse best. Created by Sam Esmail, an Egyptian-American, the show pits technology against the economy and its unstable protagonist against himself. The plot concerns a group of anarchist hackers conspiring to topple a corporation; with it go the stability of world markets and everybody\u2019s financial debt. But it\u2019s also a mystery about the identity of its protagonist, a mentally ill, morphine-addicted hacker named Elliot. We think he\u2019s obeying the commands of the show\u2019s title character, the head of a hacktivist outfit, but it turns out that he has been commanding himself all along. Significant parts of this world are figments of his delusion. Elliot is at least two people. Some of the dark excitement of this show is that he might be even more.\u2018\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019\u2019 is worst-of-times TV, reflecting a mood of menacing instability. Over the course of its 10 episodes, almost no one was who they appeared to be. A straight married man seemed to think nothing of his sleeping with a gay work underling (and neither did his wife). A character who seemed, to my eyes at least, to be a transgender woman at some point appeared as a conventional man. Was that a coming out? A going in? Both? This isn\u2019t a show I watched for what was going to happen but for who people were going to turn into, or who they wanted to turn out to be. It\u2019s a show about the way your online profile can diverge from your real-life identity, yes, but also the way you can choose a self or a self can choose you.I can\u2019t recall the last time the attitudes of a single fictional character led the national news. But there was bigoted old Atticus, on the front pages, being discussed on cable. One of the most iconic white antiracists had grown fond of white supremacy. It raised an uncomfortable question: If you had identified with the original Atticus Finch, did his Archie Bunkerization make a racist out of you too? The public hand-wringing was a perverse refreshment because, even if only for a few days, it left white people dwelling on race as intensely as nonwhite people. This new Atticus was a betrayal of white liberal idealism, feeding a suspicion that that idealism was less than absolute \u2014 that it could suddenly, randomly turn against the people it purported to help.It was almost as if Lee knew, in 1957, about the mood of the country in 2015 \u2014 about the way a series of dead black men and women would further cleave apart the country; about the massacre of nine black churchgoers by a young white supremacist in a South Carolina church, and the ensuing debate over the Confederate flag; about the fear of inevitable, inexorable racial, gender and sexual evolution; about the perceived threats to straight-white-male primacy by Latino immigrants, proliferating Spanish, same-sex marriage, female bosses and a black president.The yearning to transcend race keeps coming up against the bedrock cultural matter of separateness. But the tectonic plates of the culture keep pushing against one another with greater, earthquaking force. The best show in our era about that quake \u2014 about the instability of identity and the choosing of a self \u2014 has been \u2018\u2018Key & Peele.\u2019\u2019 For five seasons, in scores of sketches, two biracial men, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, became different women and different men of different ethnicities, personalities and body types. They were two of the best actors on television, hailing from somewhere between the lawlessness of improv comedy and the high-impact emotionalism of Anna Deavere Smith\u2019s one-woman, zillion-character plays. \u2018\u2018Key & Peele\u2019\u2019 granted nearly every caricature a soul.The show started as a commentary on the hilarious absurdity of race, but it never fully escaped the pernicious reality of racism. The longer it ran, the more melancholy it became, the more it seethed. In the final episode, its anger caught up with its fancifulness and cheek, exploding in an old-timey musical number called \u2018\u2018Negrotown,\u2019\u2019 which opens with a black man (Key) being arrested by a white cop one night while walking down a dark alleyway. He says he\u2019s innocent of any wrongdoing and asks why he\u2019s being arrested, intensifying the cop\u2019s anger. Entering the police cruiser, he hits his head on the car door. Suddenly, a homeless man (Peele) arrives on the scene and offers to take the black guy off the cop\u2019s hands. The cop gratefully acquiesces.Taking the disoriented man by the hand, the homeless guy leads him through an alley door. They find themselves on the threshold of a sunny neighborhood. The homeless guy is now dressed in a three-piece suit the color of pink grapefruit meat, and he begins to sing in a camped-up, zero-calorie Paul Robeson baritone about this new place, \u2018\u2018where there ain\u2019t no pain, ain\u2019t no sorrow.\u2019\u2019 Black people in bright clothes are dancing in the streets, singing in giddy verse about the special virtues of their town: You can get a cab to pick you up, have a loan application approved, even wear a hoodie without getting shot. Plus: \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no stupid-ass white folks touching your hair or stealing your culture, claiming it\u2019s theirs.\u2019\u2019But it\u2019s clear from the start that the \u2018\u2018neighborhood\u2019\u2019 is a studio backlot, and the dancers are costumed in the colors of Skittles, and their dancing involves a lot of grinning and spinning and stretching out their arms \u2014 shuffling. Black freedom looks like a white 1940s Hollywood director\u2019s idea of it. At the end of the number, the dancers stand frozen with their arms raised in a black-power salute, as if waiting for someone to yell \u2018\u2018cut.\u2019\u2019 No one does.The dream melts away, and we\u2019re back with the guy being arrested, passed out on the ground. The cop starts shoving him into the cruiser. \u2018\u2018I thought I was going to Negrotown,\u2019\u2019 he says.\u2018\u2018Oh, you are,\u2019\u2019 the cop replies, as the piano riff from the song starts to play and the car drives off.The show left us with a dream of Edenic self-containment as the key to black contentment \u2014 a stunning contradiction of all its previous sketches. It was a rebuke to both racial integration and ghettoization. It split me open. I cried with laughter at the joke of this obviously fake place as a kind of heaven. I cried with sadness, because if you\u2019re in Negrotown, you\u2019re also in a special ring of hell.It could be that living with recycled conflict is part of the national DNA. Yet it\u2019s also in our natures to keep trying to change, to discover ourselves. In \u2018\u2018Far From the Tree,\u2019\u2019 Andrew Solomon\u2019s landmark 2012 book about parenting and how children differentiate themselves, he makes a distinction between vertical and horizontal identity. The former is defined by traits you share with your parents, through genes and norms; the latter is defined by traits and values you don\u2019t share with them, sometimes because of genetic mutation, sometimes through the choice of a different social world. The emotional tension in the book\u2019s scores of stories arises from the absence of love for or empathy toward someone with a pronounced or extreme horizontal identity \u2014 homosexuality or autism or severe disability. Solomon is writing about the struggle to overcome intolerance and estrangement, and to better understand disgust; about our comfort with fixed, established identity and our distress over its unfixed or unstable counterpart.His insights about families apply to us as a country. We\u2019re a vertical nation moving horizontally. We\u2019re daring to erase the segregating boundaries, to obliterate oppressive institutions, to get over ourselves. Nancy Meyers knows it. Sam Esmail knows it. So, in his way, does Donald Trump. The transition should make us stronger \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t kill us first.Wesley Morris is the new critic at large for The New York Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase Reports Decline in Revenue but a Surge in New Mortgages", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bank, the nation\u2019s largest by assets, said on Tuesday that revenue fell in all its major business lines in the quarter from both the previous quarter and the quarter a year earlier. That left overall revenue down 6 percent, to $23.5 billion, from a year ago \u2014 a sharper decline than analysts had expected.The results, which, unusually, came after the market close, kicked off the earnings season for the Wall Street banks. Shares of JPMorgan slipped in after-hours trading.JPMorgan did have a higher profit for the quarter, but that was largely a result of a one-time tax benefit of $2.2 billion. Putting aside that benefit and other irregular items, the bank earned $5.4 billion, or $1.32 a share \u2014 lower than the Wall Street estimate of $1.37 a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. When the one-time items were included, the bank\u2019s profit rose 22 percent, to $6.8 billion, or $1.68 a share, in the third quarter.\u201cUnderlying results were somewhat mixed,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.The bank\u2019s best-performing division was its consumer bank. While overall revenue was down slightly in the division, the consumer bank has been originating more loans. That, the bank\u2019s executives said, is a good sign for the American economy, despite some recent data suggesting that employment growth may be slowing.\u201cThe U.S. economy is doing pretty well,\u201d Ms. Lake said. \u201cWe are seeing good demand for loans.\u201dThe bank issued 41 percent more mortgages than it did a year ago, and 2 percent more than it did last quarter.The improving outlook for consumers allowed the bank to reduce the pool of money it has put aside to cover loan losses.The bank also emphasized the continuing expansion of its mobile and digital tools for customers. That is allowing the bank to spend less on branches.The biggest concerns for JPMorgan came from its Wall Street operations, which have already been shrinking as a result of new regulations and uncertainty in the markets.Revenue from the bond and fixed-income trading desks, which have been bearing the brunt of the changes, fell 11 percent from a year earlier.In the most recent quarter, questions about the strength of the Chinese economy set off a bout of market volatility in August. But Ms. Lake said that since the beginning of the fourth quarter, trading activity had been quiet. If that continues, she said, it will pull down the bank\u2019s future results more than analysts have been anticipating.Ms. Lake also blamed the volatile markets for the struggles at JPMorgan\u2019s asset management division, which has been a steady outperformer in recent years and is an important part of the company\u2019s future strategy.For the first time in several years, customer money flowed out of JPMorgan\u2019s various asset management products, like its mutual funds. The amount of money the company is managing for clients is now lower than it was a year ago.The $2.2 billion tax benefit that the company received in the third quarter was a result of issues stemming from the financial crisis that have just been resolved, Ms. Lake said, though she did not provide much detail on the number.Mr. Dimon, however, apparently could not resist on Tuesday and often jumped in on the call to add his own thoughts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Sought a Green Seal for Its Diesel Cars ", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In July 2011, President Obama took the stage here to announce sweeping new fuel economy and carbon emissions targets for vehicles in the United States. Joining him were top executives from nearly every automaker, representing 90 percent of vehicles sold domestically.But one automaker in particular was missing from the stage: Volkswagen.\u201cThey wanted a special deal for diesel cars that we now know weren\u2019t even meeting the standard,\u201d said Margo Oge, a former director of the E.P.A. Office of Transportation and Air Quality, who helped lead negotiations with the automakers, including Volkswagen, at the time.Volkswagen did not just consider its clean diesels comparable to hybrids or plug-in electrics; it believed they were superior, Ms. Oge said.\u201cThese people had religion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that religion was diesel. They simply did not believe in electric powertrains and thought they were a waste of time.\u201dOne of the most devout followers was a top Volkswagen executive from Germany who has been suspended in the wake of the emissions scandal. The executive, Wolfgang Hatz, most recently led Porsche\u2019s research and development efforts, but had been in charge of Volkswagen\u2019s powertrain division.\u201cHe said the company simply did not believe in electric powertrains or hybrids,\u201d Ms. Oge said. \u201cThe Volkswagen management was extraordinarily arrogant. They thought they were the kings of diesel.\u201dWhile German rivals like BMW had been developing electric cars, and Mercedes-Benz \u2014 which also boycotted the announcement over concerns the rules favored American trucks \u2014 had invested in alternatives like fuel cell technology, Volkswagen had thrown its entire weight behind the promise of clean diesels.Without special incentives, the company would have a tougher time meeting the requirements of the new regulations.But American officials were not swayed. Hybrids would not get such special credits (which Toyota had requested), because regulators considered the technology sufficiently mature. By comparison, diesel engines had been around for a century.Their verdict was not well received.A former Volkswagen employee familiar with the 2011 negotiations confirmed that the diesel issue was responsible for the company\u2019s lack of public support at Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement.It was mainly Volkswagen representatives from Germany, as opposed to American-based executives, who dominated the discussions and tended to dismiss the regulators\u2019 concerns and questions, Ms. Oge said.\u201cI never had a problem dealing with the Americans. The U.S. Volkswagen people would always come and apologize to us after meeting with the Germans,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sense was that things were being dictated by Germany.\u201dWhat remains unknown is whether Mr. Hatz knew of the emissions cheating when he was negotiating with American regulators in 2011.He did not respond to an email requesting a comment on Tuesday. A spokesman for Porsche said that Mr. Hatz was contesting the implication that he was involved in the emissions cheating. Volkswagen\u2019s American headquarters did not respond to a request for comment.But the suggestion that Mr. Hatz, 56, may have played a role in the scandal has been a shock in German car industry circles, where he has been a prominent figure in engine development.Unlike many Volkswagen executives, including the new chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, Mr. Hatz has not spent his entire career at the company. After studying machine tool construction, he began his career at Porsche before its acquisition by Volkswagen. Later he worked at BMW, General Motors\u2019 Opel unit, and Fiat, always in positions that involved designing engines, in some cases racecar engines.Mr. Hatz joined Volkswagen\u2019s Audi division in 2001, becoming director of engine and transmission development for all Volkswagen brands in 2007.

{"Headline": "Keynes Comes to Canada", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore I get into the implications, let\u2019s talk about Canada\u2019s long history of quiet economic unorthodoxy, especially on currency policy.In the 1950s, everyone considered it essential to peg their currency to the U.S. dollar, at whatever cost \u2014 everyone except Canada, which let its own dollar fluctuate, and discovered that a floating exchange rate actually worked pretty well. Later, when European nations were scrambling to join the euro \u2014 amid predictions that any country refusing to adopt the common currency would pay a severe price \u2014 Canada showed that it\u2019s feasible to keep your own money despite close economic ties to a giant neighbor.Oh, and Canadians were less caught up than the rest of us in the ideology of bank deregulation. As a result, Canada was spared the worst of the 2008 financial crisis.Which brings us to the issue of deficits and public investment. Here\u2019s what the Liberal Party of Canada platform had to say on the subject: \u201cInterest rates are at historic lows, our current infrastructure is aging rapidly, and our economy is stuck in neutral. Now is the time to invest.\u201dDoes that sound reasonable? It should, because it is. We\u2019re living in a world awash with savings that the private sector doesn\u2019t want to invest, and is eager to lend to governments at very low interest rates. It\u2019s obviously a good idea to borrow at those low, low rates, putting those excess savings, not to mention the workers unemployed due to weak demand, to use building things that will improve our future.The answer is that in 2010 elite opinion somehow coalesced around the view that deficits, not high unemployment and weak growth, were the great problem facing policy makers. There was never any evidence for this view; after all, those low interest rates showed that markets weren\u2019t at all worried about debt. But never mind \u2014 it was what all the important people were saying, and all that you read in much of the financial press. And few politicians were willing to challenge this orthodoxy.Most notably, those who should have stood up for public spending suffered a striking failure of nerve. Britain\u2019s Labour Party, in particular, essentially accepted Conservative claims that the nation was facing a fiscal crisis, and was reduced to arguing at the margin about what form austerity should take. Even President Obama temporarily began echoing Republican rhetoric about the need to tighten the government\u2019s belt.And having bought into deficit panic, center-left parties found themselves in an extremely weak position. Austerity rhetoric comes naturally to right-wing politicians, who are always arguing that we can\u2019t afford to help the poor and unlucky (although somehow we\u2019re able to afford tax cuts for the rich). Center-left politicians who endorse austerity, however, find themselves reduced to arguing that they won\u2019t inflict quite as much pain. It\u2019s a losing proposition, politically as well as economically.Let\u2019s hope, then, that Mr. Trudeau stays with the program. He has an opportunity to show the world what truly responsible fiscal policy looks like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Mitt Romney!", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes I find myself feeling sorry for Mitt Romney. No, seriously. In another time and place, he might have been respected as an effective technocrat \u2014 a smart guy valued (although probably not loved) for his ability to get things done. In fact, that\u2019s kind of how it worked when he was governor of Massachusetts, a decade ago.But now it\u2019s 2015 in America, and Mr. Romney\u2019s party doesn\u2019t want people who get things done. On the contrary, it actively hates government programs that improve American lives, especially if they help Those People. And this means that Mr. Romney can\u2019t celebrate his signature achievement in public life, the Massachusetts health reform that served as a template for Obamacare.Not surprisingly, then, Mr. Romney quickly tried to walk his comments back, claiming that Obamacare is very different from Romneycare, which it isn\u2019t, and that it has failed.But you know, it hasn\u2019t. On the contrary, the Affordable Care Act has been a remarkable success, especially considering the scorched-earth opposition it has faced.Oh, and have you noticed how those ads featuring people supposedly hurt by Obamacare have disappeared? That\u2019s because none of their stories held up.In short, President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who pushed the Affordable Care Act through despite total opposition from the G.O.P., have a lot to be proud of. And so does Mr. Romney, who helped lay the foundation. Instead, however, he\u2019s trashing the best thing he\u2019s ever done.You have to wonder: Does Mr. Romney really think that his party would look more favorably on Obamacare if it worked even better than it has, if it cost no money at all? If so, he\u2019s delusional. After all, the great majority of Republican-controlled states have turned down free money, refusing to let the federal government expand Medicaid (and in so doing pump money into their economies).The point is that from the point of view of the Republican base, covering the uninsured, or helping the unlucky in general, isn\u2019t a feature, it\u2019s a bug. It\u2019s not about how much it costs in taxpayer funds or economic impact: the base is actually willing to lose money in order to perpetuate suffering.Maybe Mr. Romney still imagines that a desperate party will call on him to save it from Donald Trump. Or maybe he just can\u2019t bring himself to admit that he picked the wrong group of people to hang out with. Either way, one hopes for his sake that he eventually gives up his illusions. Trust me, Mitt: it will be a liberating experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Social Security Raises Even if Medicare Soars", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith millions of older Americans on fixed incomes facing that one-two punch, the Obama administration is urging Congress to stop \u2014 or at least moderate \u2014 the health insurance premium increases, which could raise the cost for some Medicare beneficiaries by about 50 percent \u2014 the largest increase in the history of Medicare. But the leadership crisis in the House of Representatives could prove to be an obstacle.Social Security has provided automatic cost-of-living adjustments in every year since 1975, with exceptions in 2010 and 2011. But inflation was extremely low in the past 12 months, leading to another benefit freeze, Social Security officials said. Gasoline prices, in particular, have declined sharply, holding down overall prices in the economy.Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, has put a positive spin on the absence of a cost-of-living adjustment. It results, he said, from a \u201csharp decline in energy prices that is putting more money in families\u2019 pockets\u201d and is contributing to the economic recovery.Many older Americans do not see it that way. \u201cPeople can afford to drive to the drugstore because gas prices are lower, but once they get there, they may not be able to afford their prescriptions,\u201d said Joshua E. Rosenblum, a spokesman for AARP, a lobbying group for older Americans.With the greater use of medical services by an aging population, health costs have again begun to climb, driven in part by new technology and expensive prescription drugs. Medicare needs additional money to help pay for Part B of the program, which covers doctors\u2019 services, outpatient hospital care and some medications.About 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will be protected against higher premiums in 2016. Under federal law, Medicare premiums are linked closely to Social Security benefits because most people on Medicare have their premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security checks. To protect older Americans, federal law stipulates that, in most cases, the increase in a person\u2019s Medicare premium cannot exceed the increase in the person\u2019s Social Security benefit. The purpose of this \u201chold harmless\u201d provision is to prevent a reduction in Social Security benefits.But by shielding 70 percent of beneficiaries from premium increases, that same law exposes the other 30 percent to price shocks. Medicare actuaries predicted in July that the standard premium for those beneficiaries would rise next year to $159 a month, from a little less than $105 a month for most beneficiaries, the same as in 2013 and 2014.The actuaries also predicted an increase in the annual deductible for Part B of Medicare, to $223 next year, from $147 in 2015. Beneficiaries generally must pay the deductible before Medicare begins to pay.Premiums are supposed to cover about one-fourth of the projected cost of Part B of Medicare, with general revenues accounting for the remainder. If premiums are frozen for 70 percent of beneficiaries, higher overall Medicare costs must be spread across a smaller group of people.That smaller group, of more than 15 million, includes some high-income Medicare beneficiaries who are already required to pay higher premiums and may be able to afford the price increase. It also includes beneficiaries who are new to Medicare in 2016; those who do not receive Social Security checks; and low-income people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, whose premiums are paid by state Medicaid programs.Even some affluent beneficiaries could struggle with the higher costs. For those with incomes of more than $214,000 a year, Medicare actuaries say, premiums next year could exceed $500 a month, up from about $335, if Congress does not change the law. Financially struggling state governments are expressing concern because they are responsible for many low-income beneficiaries. The National Governors Association estimates that the higher premiums will cost states $2.3 billion next year.In the absence of legislative action, the White House faces a choice between two politically perilous options. It could authorize a big increase in Medicare premiums for those 15 million. Or it could authorize the secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to take money from Medicare\u2019s \u201ccontingency reserve,\u201d which serves as a cushion in case actual spending is higher than projected. The contingency fund is already lower than the level recommended by Medicare\u2019s actuaries.The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had been quietly exploring a deal to limit the increase in Medicare premiums.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, said any solution should be \u201cfiscally responsible.\u201dMs. Pelosi and other Democrats sounded an alarm last week and placed the onus on Republicans.\u201cFor the past month,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cwe have been reaching out to the Republicans to say, \u2018This deadline is racing toward us.\u2019 We must act so that we stop the pain that will be inflicted upon our seniors.\u201dRepresentative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said: \u201cThis is a disaster for many older Americans. I get panicked phone calls to my office, begging us to act.\u201dRon Thompson, the president of the Virginia Alliance for Retired Americans, said the higher premiums would put \u201ctoo much of a burden on seniors.\u201d\u201cHealth care costs are going up,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, \u201cbut the federal government is saying seniors do not need a cost-of-living increase next year.\u201dThe Social Security Act specifies a formula for determining the cost-of-living adjustment based on a broad measure of consumer prices for urban wage earners and clerical workers, but older Americans say this measure of inflation does not fully reflect price increases for the goods and services they use. Older Americans typically devote more of their budgets to medical care.State governments, too, say they cannot absorb the hit.\u201cThe cost of protecting Medicare beneficiaries should be borne by the federal government rather than placed on the backs of states,\u201d Dan L. Crippen, the executive director of the governors association, said last week in a letter to congressional leaders.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the senator from Utah whose committee has jurisdiction over Medicare. He is Orrin G. Hatch, not Orin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Other People\u2019s Money,\u2019 by John Kay", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In an 1814 letter, Thomas Jefferson complained that the financial sector of his day was populated by \u201cadventurers .\u2008.\u2008. who burthen all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits, profits which are the price of no useful industry, of theirs.\u201d Almost exactly two centuries later, John Kay echoes the sentiment, noting that as \u201cexchanging bits of paper cannot make profits for everyone,\u201d it is very likely that much of finance\u2019s profit \u201crepresents not the creation of new wealth but the sector\u2019s appropriation of wealth created elsewhere in the economy.\u201dThe charge is an old one that has taken on new relevance in the wake of the 2008 crisis. Yet Kay is no angry Jeffersonian agrarian, but rather an academic economist with a weekly Financial Times column and a onetime financial consultant. He is more sanguine than the typical \u00adfinance basher in that he acknowledges the sector\u2019s critical roles: as a payment system, a means of channeling savings to productive investments, an instrument to help manage personal finances across the life cycle and generations, and a marketplace for transferring and managing risk.Nonetheless, Kay writes, a more recent process of \u201cfinancialization\u201d has created a hypertrophied sector, its activities ever more abstract and divorced from the real economy, successful mainly at multiplying the remuneration of its members. \u201cThe tip of the tongue that laps up the cream of the commerce of a continent\u201d was how Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. described the New York money center of his day; Kay might rather characterize it as a gobbling maw.Finance, Kay argues, has strayed dangerously from its core functions. And the functions themselves have been jumbled in dangerous ways (for example, with \u00addeposit-taking becoming the funding source for uncertain, long-term risk-\u00adtaking). Within each function, activities have moved from the primary to the (literally and figuratively) derivative \u2014 less investing, more trading, fewer assets and more \u201casset-backed securities.\u201d Meanwhile, long-term relationships have been reduced to short-term transactions. The result: instability and crisis.While the gravamen of its complaint is old, \u201cOther People\u2019s Money\u201d is not merely another broadside content to denounce finance\u2019s dysfunction, but rather a masterly attempt to locate its various origins and connect them with analytical and theoretical rigor. Kay provides by way of context a panoptic overview of the history, evolution and structure of the financial system in the United States and Britain, one that is impressive in its ability to weave together a comprehensive range of material, from the mechanics of banking to the Gaussian copula, in elegant, jargon-free prose. He confidently employs many perspectives: economic, historical, legal and psychological. Call this technique a Lombard Street for the 21st century.The last third of the book insightfully addresses reform, which, refreshingly, Kay stresses is not the same as regulation. Some of finance\u2019s most abstruse and pernicious activity arises from regulatory arbitrage \u2014 restructuring transactions so that they move from a less favorable to a more favorable regulatory rubric. Moreover, financial regulation suffers from a faster-spinning revolving door compared with other industries, with the regulators themselves either coming from or looking forward to landing in the industry they are supposed to oversee. Kay writes like an anthropologist: The roots of finance\u2019s dysfunction, he says, are cultural. The ethos of an old-fashioned partnership of traders risking their own capital endured even as a move toward public shareholding transferred \u201cboth these risks and these rewards from the partners .\u2008.\u2008. to the shareholders. In reality, it had little effect on the financial expectations of those who worked in the firms.\u201d Reform has to mean changing the industry culture: inculcating an ethic of stewardship and faithful agency (living the rhetoric of \u201cputting the client first\u201d) and changing industry structure where culture clash is insuperable.It\u2019s a pity policy makers didn\u2019t have this book in 2007. In 2015, it can read like an indictment of a convict already sentenced. Post-crisis, banks are more heavily capitalized, trading less and earning lower return on equity. \u201cLarge financial conglomerates were run for the primary benefit of the people who manage them \u2014 and, in the main they still are,\u201d Kay says. But surely to a decreasing degree: At Goldman Sachs, the amount of total revenue that is set aside for employee compensation has gone from more than 50 percent before the crisis to about 37 percent in 2014. Still, this can feel like a change born of chastening rather than epiphany. Kay makes a strong case that change must be embraced rather than accepted grudgingly if it is to endure.OTHER PEOPLE\u2019S MONEYThe Real Business of FinanceBy John Kay336 pp. PublicAffairs. $27.99.Benjamin Heller is a hedge fund portfolio manager based in Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Cuba, an Abundance of Love but a Lack of Babies", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 A magnetic energy courses between Claudia Rodriguez and Alejandro Padilla, binding the couple in clich\u00e9s of intimacy: the tendency to finish each other\u2019s sentences; hands that naturally gravitate toward one another; a shared laughter that forms the soundtrack of their romance.What their love will not bear, for the moment, is a family. Though they plan to marry and have children, they will wait \u2014 until they are no longer sharing a small apartment with a half-dozen others, or perhaps until obtaining diapers and formula is no longer a gamble.In short, they will be waiting a long time.The demographic crisis is both an economic and a political one. The aging population will require a vast health care system, the likes of which the state cannot afford. And without a viable work force, the cycle of flight and wariness about Cuba\u2019s future is even harder to break, despite the country\u2019s halting steps to open itself up to the outside world.\u201cWe are all so excited about the trade and travel that we have overlooked the demographics problem,\u201d said Hazel Denton, a former World Bank economist who has studied Cuban demographics. \u201cThis is a significant issue.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, we don\u2019t want to make things more difficult for ourselves,\u201d said Laura Rivera Gonzalez, an architecture student, standing with her husband in central Havana. \u201cJust graduating doesn\u2019t mean that things are resolved. That won\u2019t sustain us.\u201dMs. Gonzalez embodies a common feature of the Cuban demographic crisis: As the government educated its people after the revolution, achieving one of the highest literacy rates in the world, its citizens became more cautious about bearing children. Scant job opportunities, a shortage of available goods and a dearth of sufficient housing encouraged Cubans to wait to start a family, sometimes indefinitely.\u201cEducation for women is the button you press when you want to change fertility preferences in developing countries,\u201d said Dr. Denton, who now teaches at Georgetown University. \u201cYou educate the woman, then she has choices \u2014 she stays longer in school, marries at an older age, has the number of children she wants and uses contraception in a more healthy manner.\u201dThere is another factor that alters the equation in Cuba: Abortion is legal, free and commonly practiced. There is no stigma attached to the procedure, helping to make Cuba\u2019s reported abortion rates among the highest in the world. In many respects, abortion is viewed as another manner of birth control.In Cuba, women are free to choose as they wish, another legacy of the revolution, which prioritized women\u2019s rights. They speak openly about abortions, and lines at clinics often wrap around the building.But experts caution that the liberal abortion policy is not responsible for the declining population. Rather, it is a symptom of a larger issue. Generally speaking, many Cubans simply believe they cannot afford a child.\u201cI\u2019ve had two abortions, one of them with Jorge,\u201d said Claudia Aguilar San Juan, a 27-year-old restaurant worker, referring to her boyfriend of two years, Jorge Antonio Nazco. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t think we were ready to have kids, and we continue to think that it\u2019s still not the time.\u201dContradiction is more than just a sign of a changing Cuba \u2014 it is a fundamental characteristic of it.Mr. Nazco added: \u201cWe need to be able to afford basic things for ourselves, and we\u2019re also not going to be living three people in one room. I just want to give my kids a comfortable life, a better life than what I had.\u201dThat is the case with Elisabeth Dominguez and Eddy Marrero. Together, the couple earn about $70 a month for her work as a psychologist and his as a pediatric nurse, a relatively high income by Cuban standards.The standard, however, is the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s barely enough for the two of us,\u201d said Ms. Dominguez, 29, shaking her head. \u201cHow could we afford a kid?\u201dRecognizing the problem, the government has begun to circulate pro-pregnancy pamphlets and fliers to encourage young couples to keep their children. Some women said that in recent months, government doctors had discouraged them from having abortions, while others have noticed sudden shortages of condoms and birth control pills.While those assertions could not be verified, most experts say it hardly matters. Cuba will not be able to procreate its way out of the current crisis anytime soon.Few tactics work to increase a nation\u2019s fertility rate, despite efforts in countries like Japan to pay families to have children.What some suggest could help is if the government could manage to encourage the vast Cuban expatriate population to come home. There, too, the government has shown some willingness to adjust its stance, including easing the return of islanders living or traveling abroad.But surmounting the longstanding bitterness of many families toward the government, which still holds a tight grip on the country, poses challenges of its own. And the returning Cubans will need to be interested in more than an extended vacation or investment opportunity.\u201cAlready there is more flow,\u201d said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies Cuba, referring to the return of Cubans abroad in their 20s, 30s and 40s. \u201cBut is it going to be a matter of \u2018I want my vacation home there,\u2019 or will they put down roots?\u201dSeparated families are a fact of life for most Cubans, another element straining the state of the Cuban family. With millions abroad, and a domestic population of just over 11 million, few families are left untouched by the schism that followed the country\u2019s revolution.Ms. Rodriguez and Mr. Padilla both have relatives living in the United States, some of whom they have not seen for years. Some do not want to return, having disconnected from the rhythm of life on the island. Others return and appear changed, no longer the cousins and nephews from years before.In many respects, their relationship represents the challenges facing the government as it confronts an industrialized world problem with a developing world economy.In their minds, there is no doubt they will get married. As a jeweler, Mr. Padilla, 29, plans to design the ring himself and propose once he saves enough to buy a diamond.Even then, they say, they are not certain they can afford the burden of a child. Earlier this year, the pair aborted a pregnancy, a decision for which they both express a degree of sadness. Still, it is not so uncommon in their families. Their mothers have had four abortions each, the two say, seated on the back porch of Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s mother\u2019s home, where the couple live.Mr. Padilla, smirking, blurted out that Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s aunt had undergone 10 procedures, prompting his partner to laugh.\u201cQuiet,\u201d she whispered sharply, slapping his arm. \u201cShe has a degree in French and is inside right now.\u201dHe giggled quietly and looped his arm through hers. Ultimately, he said, they do want a family. The when of the matter would come in the not-too-distant future, he hoped.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to pressure ourselves,\u201d Mr. Padilla said. \u201cWe want to live our lives, day by day, each day in its own time.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: A New Mazda MX-5, but Still the Old Driving Joy", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenMAZDA has produced nearly a million MX-5s since the car arrived on the market in 1989, making it the most popular roadster of all time (the MG MGB is a distant second at 386,961, according to Hemmings).You don\u2019t know what an MX-5 is? In the United States the car is known as the Miata, a name unique to our country and officially dropped by Mazda nearly 10 years ago. That is like trying to rename the Mustang. The Miata\u2019s fans simply ignored the name change. Though the new fourth generation version wears only an MX-5 badge, Mazda often slips \u201cMiata\u201d into its American marketing.Full disclosure: I bought a new original year Miata back in the day and still own that 1990 model. Cars have changed a lot in 26 years, but the MX-5 remains remarkably true to its original mission of maximum fun with minimum bloat. The 2016 car is better in every way, though I would argue that the original has a cleaner and more elegant design.Modern Miatas \u2014 I mean, MX-5s \u2014 have four airbags, traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes and a stout structure, stuff that owners of the first-generation Miata could only dream about. Powerful headlights are LED. At 2,332 pounds, it is 150 pounds lighter than the departing model \u2014 important because the 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine makes only 155 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. The automatic and terrific manual transmissions channel six forward speeds to the rear wheels.The Miata\u2019s secret sauce is balance and not just the 50-50 weight distribution front to back. There is just enough power and grip for an enchanting kind of hustle. The electric power steering chats it up with the road, and that short-throw manual shifter is crisp. Drop the top and all senses are engaged. MX-5 Miata defines driving joy.That bliss tapers off the larger and taller you are. Mazda has designed the cozy cockpit to accommodate a wider range of drivers, but those over six feet tall will start to feel the squeeze. The steering wheel doesn\u2019t adjust for reach. Small cubbies are scattered around the attractive cabin, but Mazda did away with the glove compartment.The manual cloth top uses high-quality material. Pop the single latch and simply toss the roof back. It can be raised easily while sitting in the seats, which save weight and space by using a stretchy fabric suspended by a frame, much like an Aeron office chair.Improved by 25 percent, fuel economy is rated by the government at 27 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway. The city gas mileage is close to the departing car\u2019s highway efficiency. The car does want premium gasoline, though.Practicality has never been a strong suit of the MX-5. The most you will jam into the larger trunk is two small carry-on suitcases. My wife and I drove cross-country in mine when it was new. My advice? Approach it like backpacking.Few cars offer this combination of poise, balance and tanning ability, and none at the base price of $25,735 (the Club model I tested is $33,120 optioned up with the Brembo/BBS package). Some will call it MX-5, others Miata. Everyone who fits into it will call it a romping good time.Advertisement"}

The question of staying in the union will be determined by a referendum before the end of 2017.\u201cOverall European Union membership has increased the openness of the U.K. economy, facilitating dynamism but also creating some monetary and financial stability challenges for the Bank of England to manage,\u201d he said. \u201cThus far, we have been able to meet these challenges.\u201dMr. Carney said that after the euro crisis, Britain\u2019s openness had made it vulnerable to shocks and that the union should have \u201cclear principles to safeguard the interests of non-euro member states,\u201d like Britain.Aside from his status as a central bank governor, Mr. Carney may prove to be an influential player in the debate partly because, as a Canadian, he is a relative newcomer to Britain\u2019s agonized internal debate about its place in Europe.\u201cAlternative arrangements to full membership either have serious downsides or are surrounded by huge uncertainty,\u201d the group said.It conceded that some of its members \u201crecognize that there are disadvantages to E.U. membership,\u201d and called for the regulatory burden on smaller businesses to be lightened, as well as for measures to increase competitiveness in Europe.But it said that membership in the bloc remained in the national interest. \u201cFor business, the benefits of full membership outweigh the disadvantages, but the European Union must work better,\u201d the confederation\u2019s director general, John Cridland, said.Both sides have started publicity campaigns in recent weeks, and while big business appears more favorable to the \u201cin\u201d campaign, there are also some significant figures in the business world who want Britain out.They say that Britain could forge advantageous trade deals outside the bloc and free itself of ties to sluggish European economies.Prime Minister David Cameron says he intends to renegotiate important aspects of Britain\u2019s membership before the referendum. If those changes are approved, he would use them to persuade Britons to stay in.Under pressure from several European allies, including France, Mr. Cameron has promised to give more information next month on the types of changes he wants. But on Tuesday, Britain\u2019s minister for Europe, David Lidington, suggested this would not amount to a detailed list.Progress in these negotiations will determine the timing of the referendum, Mr. Lidington said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Cuts Interest Rates for Sixth Time Since November", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As China confronts a persistent slowdown in growth, its government moved to pump more money into the economy using stimulus measures that could create other challenges for the country.Chinese officials on Friday mostly followed a well-worn playbook, putting in effect a number of measures designed to help lower corporate borrowing costs. The central bank cut interest rates for the sixth time in less than a year, and it freed up banks to lend more money for the fourth time since November.The government also took a step toward easing the pressures for consumers, by removing a cap on the interest rates that banks can pay for deposits. The decision, part of a broader effort to liberalize the banking system and make it more efficient, may help increase household incomes, a critical piece of the economic puzzle.Inflation, too, has been weak. Like Europe and Japan, China is dealing with disinflation in producer prices and weak increases in consumer prices. Such an environment can cause companies to cut investment and consumers to refrain from spending, pulling down the overall economy.While China\u2019s economy is hardly falling off a cliff, the spate of actions in recent months suggests that the troubles are mounting. And analysts indicated that more stimulus may be necessary.The moves \u201cintensify concerns that the measures taken so far have had limited traction in supporting growth and that more drastic measures might be required in the coming months,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, who used to head the China division of the International Monetary Fund.China is joining a lineup of central banks seeking to prop up economic growth by easing monetary policy, even as the United States Federal Reserve considers an interest-rate increase.In China, the collection of policy measures could set off other economic troubles, complicating the country\u2019s response to slowing growth.On Friday, the People\u2019s Bank of China said it would cut the one-year lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.35 percent, effective Saturday. The benchmark deposit rate would be lowered by the same amount, to 1.5 percent.Mixed policy signals from China have roiled global investors. Here are five officials who are calling the shots in Beijing.By making loans cheaper, China is hoping to encourage companies to spend and invest. But the extra loans could foster more construction of apartment buildings, office towers and shopping malls. China is already struggling to cope with a real estate glut and a mountain of debt.\u201cThe reliance on monetary policy could also hurt the goal of rebalancing the economy by reducing the reliance on credit-fueled investment growth to boost overall growth,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.China\u2019s reliance on increasing the money circulating through the economy, which is already more than the amount in the United States, could also further weaken the Chinese currency and prompt additional outflows. The currency, the renminbi, has been a particular point of concern ever since a surprise devaluation in August sent a wave of volatility through global stock markets.The renminbi, tightly managed by the government, has remained largely stable in the two months since the devaluation. But financial outflows have increased as local and foreign investors seek to move money offshore over fears of further devaluations and the generally weaker outlook for China\u2019s growth.To help ensure stability, China\u2019s central bank paired its rate cut on Friday with a 0.5 percentage point reduction to the so-called reserve requirement ratio. The ratio stipulates how much cash commercial banks must set aside instead of lending. The cut was necessary to \u201cmaintain reasonably ample liquidity in the banking system,\u201d the central bank said in a statement.In tandem with the cuts, the central bank said it would no longer set a ceiling on the rates that banks may pay depositors.Since last year, China had been making incremental steps toward deregulating interest rates, which included a nationwide plan that began earlier this year to insure bank deposits. Allowing banks to compete for deposits by paying higher interest offers a better deal for customers, who in China tend to keep a relatively high proportion of their money in ordinary savings accounts.Neil Gough reported from Hong Kong, and Keith Bradsher from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Inquiry\u2019s Focus to Include Managers Who Turned a Blind Eye", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A widening internal investigation at Volkswagen is focusing not only on who was responsible for installing illegal software designed to fool emissions testers, but also on which managers may have learned of the deception and failed to take appropriate action, a person briefed on the inquiry said. The failure of people inside the carmaker to sound warnings about illegal engine software has emerged as a crucial element of the scandal, in which 11 million cars were programmed to produce far fewer emissions during laboratory testing than they did under normal driving conditions.The number of Volkswagen executives or engineers suspended in connection with the emissions cheating has continued to grow and could soon reach about 10, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is supposed to be confidential. Some of the employees were directly involved in programming cars to cheat on emissions tests, but others may share blame because they found out about it and did not pass the information up the chain of command.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Shareholder advocates and former employees have criticized what they said was a culture inside Volkswagen that centralized decision making at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, and discouraged open discussion of problems, creating a climate in which people may have been fearful of speaking up.Volkswagen managers admitted to United States government and California regulators on Sept. 3 that cars with diesel engines were programmed to evade emissions tests.Jones Day, a United States law firm with offices in Germany, has been conducting an internal investigation on behalf of the Volkswagen supervisory board into who shares blame for the emissions scandal, which has thrown the company into turmoil and is likely to cost tens of billions of euros for recalls, official penalties and legal settlements with disgruntled owners.During testing, software in so-called clean diesel engines activated emissions controls. At other times, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times the amount of nitrogen oxide, a harmful pollutant, allowed by rules in the United States. The software allowed Volkswagen vehicles to pass emissions tests without the usual trade-off in fuel economy and performance.The Jones Day inquiry is likely to last for months and has not yet reached conclusions about which engineers or managers were responsible for installing the illegal software \u2014 it first appeared in cars from the 2009 model year \u2014 and which managers later learned about it but failed to take action.Prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters, are investigating whether any crimes were committed as part of the deception. A spokesman for prosecutors did not return calls seeking comment on Sunday.Ansgar C. Rempp, the partner in charge of Jones Day in Germany, declined to comment on Sunday. A Volkswagen spokesman also declined to comment.All of the executives who have been suspended so far were in senior positions related to engine or product development, including at least one who was not working at Volkswagen when the emissions cheating began.Graham Bowley contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Book, Bernanke Pins Weak Recovery on Congress", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bernanke, who left the Fed in January 2014 after eight years as chairman, says the Fed\u2019s response to the crisis was bold and effective but insufficient.\u201cI often said that monetary policy was not a panacea \u2014 we needed Congress to do its part,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter the crisis calmed, that help was not forthcoming.\u201dMr. Bernanke\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath,\u201d is mostly an account of the Fed\u2019s response to what he has called the worst financial crisis in American history, though it begins with his family history and his journey from a small town in South Carolina to a job as the world\u2019s most powerful economic policy maker.The Fed under Mr. Bernanke is widely credited with arresting the 2008 crisis in time to stop a collapse of the nation\u2019s financial system. But its failure to prevent the crisis from erupting and the limited success of its postcrisis stimulus campaign have been criticized by some economists.Mr. Bernanke writes that the 2008 crisis is best understood as a traditional panic with some new characters: not just depositors lined up outside banks, but also other kinds of investors scrambling to get money out of other kinds of financial firms.\u201cThe magnitude of the panic at the height of the crisis was the most important reason for the severity of the Great Recession,\u201d he writes. Without that panic, he argues, housing prices would not have fallen as far and economic activity would not have contracted as sharply.Because Mr. Bernanke thought he recognized the problem, he thought he knew the solution too. The book begins, \u201cIn all crises, there are those who act and those who fear to act.\u201d Under Mr. Bernanke\u2019s leadership, the Fed pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system.\u201cThe number seemed small to me,\u201d Mr. Bernanke writes. \u201cI emailed Geithner, and he agreed. A half-hour later, we were at $25 billion a week, or $100 billion for the month of March.\u201dIn a few instances, Mr. Bernanke also acknowledges, the Fed could have done more. He writes that the decision not to lower rates in September 2008, immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, \u201cwas certainly a mistake.\u201d The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate then stood at 2 percent; by the end of the year, it had been cut nearly to zero.But Mr. Bernanke emphasizes that the Fed was legally constrained from taking some steps. It could not find a legal way to save Lehman Brothers, he argues in the book, nor could it prevent the American International Group, the insurance company, from using bailout funds to repay creditors, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. (Not everyone agrees with those assessments.)He also says the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign after the crisis was sometimes constrained by the hesitations of other Fed officials about the consequences of such large and untested measures.His sharpest words, however, are reserved for Congress. Mr. Bernanke, a former economics professor at Princeton, often seemed to suffer through his appearances before lawmakers; he writes of those encounters, \u201cIt was inevitable that they would ask questions for all sorts of purposes, but rarely because they were curious about the answer.\u201dHe also expresses puzzlement that politicians who were friendly in person would sometimes turn on him in public settings. \u201cI could never get used to the Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of politicians,\u201d he writes. Most of all, however, he chastises Congress for damaging the economy, citing several episodes, including the 2013 government shutdown.\u201cI also felt frustrated that fiscal policy makers, far from helping the economy, appeared to be actively working to hinder it,\u201d Mr. Bernanke says.Mr. Bernanke writes that he developed a thick skin at the Fed, but he gratefully recalls some rare instances of support during the heat of the crisis, including kind words from the Fed barber (known as the \u201cHairman of the Board\u201d) and a note from the baseball statistician Bill James.In the book, as in previous remarks, Mr. Bernanke acknowledges precrisis failings, including lax regulation of mortgage lending. As a member of the Fed committee responsible for consumer protection issues in the early 2000s \u2014 before becoming chairman \u2014 Mr. Bernanke heard some of the warnings repeatedly delivered to the Fed.He says that he and other officials did not want to restrict the availability of loans that might be suitable for some borrowers, so they erred on the side of expecting people to protect themselves. He has since come to the conclusion, he writes, that \u201clike flammable pajamas, some products should just be kept out of the marketplace.\u201dMr. Bernanke remains an optimist about the American economy. He writes in the closing chapter that in comparison with other developed nations, America remains relatively young and continues to invest heavily in innovation and reward entrepreneurship.\u201cWe can\u2019t say exactly when, but eventually the U.S. economy will be growing more normally,\u201d he says. \u201cDespite undeniable problems, I see the United States as one of the most attractive places to live, work and invest over the next few decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steel Mill\u2019s End Puts Upheavals of Modern Britain on View", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRedcar JournalREDCAR, England \u2014 This small town on the North Sea, famous for a century-old mill that produced the steel for some of the world\u2019s most iconic bridges, has been shattered by the news that the plant is about to shut forever, taking 2,200 jobs with it.\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m sure of in my life right now is this,\u201d he said, holding up a pint of beer.Britain \u201cis saving money and cutting the public deficit by importing cheap material from abroad,\u201d he said.The same forces are also buffeting another steel company, Tata, which announced on Friday that it was slashing 1,200 jobs in Britain, or 7 percent of its work force there.The government has announced a compensation package worth 80 million pounds, or about $123.5 million, for the Teesside workers, involving retraining and money for start-ups, but the latest crisis was the final nail for the famous steelworks.Redcar, a northeastern England town of just 35,000, is in a region already suffering from Britain\u2019s highest unemployment rate \u2014 8.5 percent, three points higher than the national figure. At least 10 percent of young people here are unemployed, and hundreds of steelworkers on contract have been fired in addition to the 2,200 employees.Once renowned for its solid industrial jobs, the town is now famous for its \u201ccharity shops, pubs and takeaways,\u201d said Claire, a 35-year-old nurse who is married to a steelworker.Without steel, Redcar offers little else to the world, except for modest summer seaside tourism. Even then, it is badly served by the local rail network \u2014 a slow, four-carriage train on rickety tracks \u2014 and British tourists find it easier to fly to Spain.\u201cIt\u2019s such a small town, it\u2019s forgotten by everyone else,\u201d said Alan Bunn, 38, another steelworker who has been laid off.The loss of Redcar\u2019s competitiveness is on open display: Even the soccer stadium in the nearby city of Middlesbrough was built using German steel. An offshore wind farm in the sea near the town was built with German and Belgian steel.The government is trying to spur the economies of larger northern cities like Manchester and Leeds, but not those quite as far north as Redcar. Its streets are lined with shuttered stores; there are 12 charity shops and six pawnshops. Cafes, restaurants and hotels that once relied on hundreds of contract workers are empty.\u201cNo one really cares about the northeast,\u201d said Mr. Bunn, the steelworker. \u201cYou grow up feeling that way. It\u2019s common knowledge.\u201dPoliticians have lost a lot of credibility among Redcar residents, he said, and voters are rejecting the dominant parties to register protest votes instead. In the May election for a parliamentary seat, the local candidate for the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party did well, coming in just shy of second place.Residents and workers like Mr. Bunn acknowledge that job losses are inevitable in a market economy. But there is widespread anger at the government for appearing to abandon the steelworks and the community.Workers and local employers say they want a robust industrial plan to level the playing field for British steel makers. For example, they say, Britain\u2019s environmental taxes and energy prices, which are the most expensive in Europe, must be reduced. They also want the government to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports and require companies and public works to use local sources for some of their material.Jason Raj, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, said the government had \u201ctaken action to help steel makers by paying \u00a347 million for compensation for energy costs.\u201d In July, Parliament voted to extend tariffs on Chinese wire rod products that Britain believes are priced below fair market value, he said, and \u201cwill consider further cases as they arise.\u201dTo Peter Atkinson, 56, the latest crisis is nothing new. He retired from the mill in 2010, a year before it was sold to its current owners. Its owner then, Tata Steel of India, had laid off 1,700 workers after a contract ended. Now his 26-year-old son, also a steelworker, is out of a job.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to look after other people in the world,\u201d he said, alluding to a recent announcement by George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, about a \u00a33 million plan to teach soccer in China. \u201cBut sometimes you\u2019ve got to look after your own.\u201dThere is a lot of griping in Redcar about China, which the Cameron government is hotly pursuing for trade deals. China produces half the world\u2019s steel, and its dominance resonates here because Britain, too, once produced half the world\u2019s steel.China has vast steel stockpiles, amassed during the years after Beijing\u2019s stimulus package in 2008. But now that its economy is losing steam, China is selling its steel at prices that British steel makers struggle to match.Britain imported 60 percent of its steel last year, according to UK Steel, an industry lobby; Chinese imports make up 8 percent of Britain\u2019s demand. The figure seems low compared with other competitors from Europe, the Middle East and Russia, said Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel. But the pace of Chinese imports is alarming, he said, quadrupling in a matter of months.Back at O\u2019Grady\u2019s, Mr. Atkinson took a philosophical view. \u201cWe were born and bred steelers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, we need to realize that everything has a life span.\u201dThe Redcar Journal article on Oct. 20, about the closing of a steel mill in Redcar, England, that illustrates the upheavals of postindustrial Britain, misstated the year that the mill was sold to its current owners and misstated the name of a city near Redcar that used German instead of local steel to build its soccer stadium. The steel mill was sold to Sahaviriya Steel Industries of Thailand in 2011, not 2010, and the city is Middlesbrough, not Middlesborough. The error in the year of sale was repeated in a picture caption with the article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Slowing Economy", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialChinese officials signaled that they are increasingly concerned about the country\u2019s slowing economy when they cut interest rates on Friday and lowered the amount of reserves banks are required to hold. But it is not clear that the actions will be sufficient to boost growth.The People\u2019s Bank of China cut its interest rate for one-year loans by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.35 percent, and lowered its reserve requirements by half a percentage point, to 17.5 percent. It was the sixth time the bank has cut rates since November. The central bank also said it would no longer cap the interest rates banks can pay for deposits.Just days earlier, the government announced that the economy grew at 6.9 percent in the third quarter, its slowest quarterly pace since 2009. Some independent analysts say the actual growth rate is probably much lower than the government\u2019s estimate. Barclays, for example, estimates the economy grew at 5.2 percent in the third quarter, based on 11 different indicators like industrial production and retail sales.China is slowing down after years of rapid growth driven by a boom in investment and borrowing. That\u2019s why cutting interest rates and bank reserves might not do much to stimulate the economy, at least not right away. Many Chinese industries, like manufacturing and mining, are closing factories and firing workers. They are not likely to borrow money even if interest rates fall and banks are more eager to lend to them. In fact, many Chinese businesses have borrowed too much money in recent years and will struggle to repay their debts.Policy makers need to do more to shift the economy away from investment and toward consumer demand and services. The central bank\u2019s decision to remove limits on deposit rates is a good step in that direction, because it should force banks to compete with one another to attract savers. Because they could not earn much by depositing money in banks, a lot of Chinese families invested in risky real estate projects or the inflated stock market. Now, they should have better options.Because it is the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, China\u2019s monetary and fiscal policies increasingly matter to the rest of the world. If the country\u2019s growth slows sharply in the coming months, that could help to tip the already fragile global economy into another recession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Regulations on Smog Remain as Divisive as Ever", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years later, Mr. Obama has no more re-election worries, and environmentalists have won a court-ordered deadline of Thursday for the E.P.A. to release the smog rule. But the regulation remains as divisive as ever. Over the past month, as the agency and White House senior officials have worked to complete it, the nation\u2019s most powerful business groups \u2014 including the Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable and American Petroleum Institute \u2014 have united on an all-fronts lobbying and advertising campaign to ensure that the rule, when it comes this week, is as weak as possible.\u201cThe costs of doing this are not going to be absorbed by a magic sponge,\u201d said Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the manufacturers group, which has been joined by dozens of mayors and governors, including many Democrats. \u201cThe impact is going to be largest on manufacturing. The tighter the standard, the more localities are impacted.\u201dOn the other side are environmental and public health groups just as invested in a strict ozone rule.\u201cThis is a battle royale,\u201d said Paul Billings, a vice president at the American Lung Association, which is leading a news media and lobbying blitz urging the Obama administration to issue the toughest rule possible. \u201cThis is a chance for the president to right a wrong, to fix a mistake.\u201dBut manufacturers say the high cost of installing ozone control equipment could kneecap American manufacturing and threaten jobs across the country.The national standard for ozone was last set in 2008 by the Bush administration at a level of 75 parts per billion, above the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion recommended by the E.P.A.\u2019s scientific advisory panel at the time. Environmental and public health groups challenged the Bush standard in court, saying it would endanger people\u2019s health and had been tainted by political interference. Smog levels have declined sharply over the last 40 years, but each incremental improvement comes at a significant cost to business and government.In November, the Obama administration released a draft proposal of an updated ozone regulation, which would lower the current threshold for ozone pollution to 65 to 70 parts per billion. That range is less stringent than the standard of 60 parts per billion sought by environmental groups, but the environmental agency\u2019s proposal also sought public comment on a 60 parts-per-billion plan, keeping open the possibility that the final rule could be stricter.Now, in the final days before the rule\u2019s release, industry groups are pushing for a new standard of 70 parts per billion or higher, while health and environmental groups want it as low as 60 parts per billion. Both sides say that every notch on that scale can make a big difference.\u201cThere are significant health benefits as the standard is tightened,\u201d Mr. Billings said.An analysis in the E.P.A.\u2019s draft proposal found that an ozone standard of 70 parts per billion would prevent 325,000 cases of childhood asthma and 1,440 premature deaths. A standard of 65 parts per billion would prevent about a million cases of asthma and 4,300 deaths. And a standard of 60 parts per billion would prevent 1.8 million asthma attacks and 7,900 premature deaths.But each notch ratchets up the cost to industry as well. A tighter smog standard would require the owners of factories and power plants to install chemical scrubbers and other technology on their smokestacks to remove the chemicals. Scrubbers can cost tens of millions of dollars apiece, and industry groups say that with each degree the standard is tightened, their costs will soar.Ross Eisenberg, a vice president at the manufacturers association, said that even a change of two parts per billion in the standard could make a difference. \u201cAt a standard of 68, there are 40 percent more counties in America that would be in noncompliance than there are with a standard of 70,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of counties would be dealing with this for the first time.\u201dA standard of 65 parts per billion, Mr. Eisenberg said, could require the use of pollution control technology that does not exist yet. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have to start shutting things down,\u201d he said.Both sides spent the final days before the rule was to be released in a sustained lobbying push. While the president has committed to putting forth aggressive rules aimed at tackling climate change, which he sees as a legacy issue, he has said almost nothing about the smog rule. That has industry advocates hopeful that their push could once again prevail in the final rule.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dual-Language Programs Are on the Rise, Even for Native English Speakers", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn one of the first days of class at Dos Puentes Elementary School in Upper Manhattan last month, a new student named Michelle peered up through pale blue glasses and took a deep breath.\u201cCan I drink water?\u201d Michelle, 6, said.\u201cDiga en Espa\u00f1ol,\u201d her first-grade teacher, Rebeca Madrigal, answered.Michelle paused.\u201cCan I drink agua?\u201d she replied.It was a start.In some localities, like New York City, the primary goal of expanding dual-language programs is to increase access to them for English-language learners, officials at the city\u2019s Education Department said.Traditionally, these children were taught almost exclusively in English. But new research suggests that while these students can take more time to get on grade level in a dual-language program, by late elementary or middle school they tend to perform as well as or better academically than their peers and may be more likely to be reclassified as proficient in English.\u201cIf someone is teaching you \u2018A, A, Apple,\u2019 and you\u2019re thinking \u2018A, A, Manzana,\u2019 you\u2019re not building on the knowledge you already bring to the table,\u201d said Victoria Hunt, the principal at Dos Puentes.At the School for International Studies, a sixth-through-12th-grade school in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the enrollment recently shot up to 100 sixth-grade students this year from 30 last year. The principal, Jillian Juman, estimated that half of that interest came from the school\u2019s recently added International Baccalaureate program, and the other half from families looking for a dual-language program, which is offered there in French.\u201cIt does allow for much more diversity,\u201d Ms. Juman said. \u201cIn terms of language, culture and socioeconomically, too.\u201dMore and more, native English-speaking parents see biliteracy in their own children as important in a global economy. In Delaware and Utah, statewide initiatives to increase dual-language education were largely conceived as a way to increase bilingualism among English speakers. For native English speakers, there is relatively little research on how dual-language programs affect their performance on standard metrics like state tests.The climb to that advantage, however, can be daunting. Depending on the model, classes are generally taught from 50 percent to 90 percent of the time in the target language, with the rest taught in English. Some programs switch halfway through the day, while others switch every other day or by subject. Especially early on, many words spoken in class are ones a child has never heard.Liz Menendez, a kindergarten teacher at Dos Puentes, said she had regular conversations with her students to reassure them that this challenge was one they could master.\u201cIf you set the tone from the beginning, then they kind of know, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to get it in just a second, let me see what she\u2019s doing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Menendez said. \u201cThey are sponges. They start attuning.\u201dTo help them along, language at Dos Puentes is color-coded, especially in the lower grades. In one classroom, a label near a jar of pencils read \u201csharpener\u201d in royal blue and \u201csacapunta\u201d in fire engine red. On a poster, the words \u201cread quietly\u201d had a blue border and \u201cleo en voz baja\u201d a red one. As a kindergarten teacher sang in Spanish with her students, she made sure to use a red marker as she wrote on a dry erase board.Shane LeClair, whose son, Tuck, 7, has been at Dos Puentes since kindergarten and is now in second grade, said that the boy spoke no Spanish when he started, but managed.\u201cIt was strangely always O.K.,\u201d Mr. LeClair said. \u201cIt was his first real school experience, and having nothing to compare it to, he jumped right in.\u201dArilda Crisostomo, who was born in the United States to Dominican parents, said she chose the program to enable her daughter, Brooke Lynn Jackson, 7, to speak to older members of the family in Spanish, but also to give her a professional advantage in the future.\u201cWe are conscious of the edge she will have when she\u2019s out in the world because she will be biliterate,\u201d Ms. Crisostomo said. \u201cThat\u2019s different from being able just to speak in Spanish.\u201dEducators caution that not all dual-language programs are equally good. If a program is not run properly, they say, the pace might be catered to native English speakers, so content in English becomes more difficult and content in the other language is too easy. And even at well-run programs, hiring qualified teachers can be a challenge.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one answer in the research, is dual-language immersion good or bad,\u201d Professor Reardon said. \u201cI think it might well depend on what the other language is relative to your home language.\u201dThat said, he added, there is only so much that can be measured.\u201cThere is great value in having a kid grow up to be bilingual, and even if your kid didn\u2019t do quite as well on the standardized math test, maybe that\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they come out with this whole extra skill they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the written Korean language.

{"Headline": "As Poland Prepares to Vote, Its Gaze Drifts Toward the Right", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAKOW MAZOWIECKI, Poland \u2014 Poland appears poised on Sunday to join the region\u2019s rightward drift toward nationalism and toss out the center-right party that has governed the European Union\u2019s sixth-largest economy for eight years. The favored party in the parliamentary election is an even more conservative one that vows to be less obsequious to richer European partners like Germany, especially over migrants.Beata Szydlo, the candidate for prime minister of the leading party, called Law and Justice, has campaigned, among other issues, against being forced by the European Union to accept a set number of the refugees who have been flooding into Europe.\u201cI just hope the prime minister will not cave in to the more powerful in the E.U.,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWe are not ready to take in migrants, though we are ready to offer humanitarian assistance. But first and foremost, we need to think about our citizens\u2019 safety.\u201dMs. Szydlo, a veteran lawmaker, was speaking to a room of supporters at the Amor Wedding House, a banquet hall in this financially struggling town 90 minutes north of Warsaw. Nearly all of the 200 or so supporters in the hall were middle-aged, and their questions bristled of anger over low pensions, lack of jobs and the sense that Poland\u2019s economic growth, while robust compared with other former Communist nations in Eastern Europe, had passed them by.\u201cLook at our ridiculous salaries and miserable pensions,\u201d said Tadeusz Szacka, 69, a mechanic. \u201cPeople are poor. They can\u2019t find work. My colleague has to go all the way to Warsaw when he works as a security guard. He leaves for work at 4 a.m. every day!\u201dMr. Szacka leaned forward sadly, scanning one of several dozen platters of pastries local party officials had provided.\u201cIf the government finally changes, everything else also should change for the better,\u201d he said, hopefully.Every pre-election poll has shown the Law and Justice party well ahead of the governing Civic Platform party, whose candidate for prime minister is the incumbent, Ewa Kopacz, though perhaps not far enough ahead to win a parliamentary majority on its own. As a result, it may need to form a coalition with one or more of the smaller parties.Law and Justice has campaigned on a \u201cPoland first\u201d message, arguing that the country has become too beholden to the European Union and promising to build a more robust regional alliance with neighbors like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.\u201cWe are happy to be part of the European Union,\u201d Ms. Szydlo said. \u201cWe just want to be treated as equals.\u201dBut there are doubts about how far the new government would go in defying Brussels.\u201cI would definitely predict that the new government will have closer relations to the United States, as there are quite a few very pro-American politicians within Law and Justice,\u201d said Sergiusz Trzeciak, a political marketing specialist at Collegium Civitas in Warsaw and an independent political consultant. \u201cAt the same time, I expect it to try to maintain good relations with the E.U. in the end. I think it will be more a question of rhetoric than changing policy.\u201dOne issue likely to be given a higher profile by a Law and Justice government \u2014 given the party\u2019s aggressive attitude toward Russia, which is even more strident than that of the current governing party \u2014 is the presence of more American troops and armaments in Poland.\u201cIt will be a very, very important topic,\u201d said Bartlomiej Biskup, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Sciences in Warsaw. \u201cThe new government will insist on the presence of more U.S. troops, and for the building of a defensive missile shield. I would definitely say that their election would make it much more likely there are more American soldiers in Poland five years from now.\u201dAt the same time, political opponents continue to warn in the prelude to Sunday\u2019s voting that Law and Justice would be inclined to follow the example of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and build a more authoritarian state that mixes nationalist language with socialistic economic policies.\u201cLaw and Justice is going to go very much in the Orban way,\u201d said Ryszard Petru, leader of a new pro-business party called Nowoczesna, or Modern. \u201cAnd that means more state intervention in the economy, a more nationalistic approach and a harder line towards the European Union.\u201d\u201cWe certainly expect that the influence of the Catholic Church will become larger,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, leader of the Left Alliance, a coalition of small left-wing parties that is scrambling to win enough votes to qualify for seats in the new Parliament. \u201cAnd Law and Justice has already said it is willing to change the Constitution, if it can get enough votes, to increase the powers of the president and take away crucial mechanisms from Parliament.\u201dAt the time, the result was seen as a sign of widespread disaffection among Polish voters for traditional parties and the entire political class, largely because of the surprisingly strong third-place showing by a new party headed by the rock singer Pawel Kukiz, whose populist coalition drew angry retirees as well as young graduates in search of jobs.In this round of voting, for the much more powerful posts in Parliament, Mr. Kukiz\u2019s coalition appears to have less support, but Mr. Petru\u2019s new party has found success with a message that includes upending the power of the country\u2019s traditional political classes.A month ago, when the European Union voted to require most member nations, including Poland, to accept some of the refugees who had been flooding into Europe, the crisis appeared set to dominate the parliamentary elections. Instead, as the election campaign enters its final days, the focus has moved to the more bread-and-butter issues that usually dominate Polish voting.Law and Justice has promised to raise the minimum wage, lower the retirement age and cut some taxes, prompting opponents to charge that such measures would hurt Poland\u2019s public finances.\u201cBasically, the business community has some reservations about Law and Justice based on their populist policies,\u201d said Witold Orlowski, director of the Warsaw University of Technology Business School. \u201cWe are not talking about the Greek story, obviously, not something to make the country go bankrupt, but perhaps an increase in the deficit of, say, 2 percent of G.D.P.\u201dWhat Law and Justice will need to do to gain the trust of the business community, he added, is to convince them that the party will keep its campaign promises but that it is not, at heart, anti-business.\u201cI\u2019m 55-years-old, and I\u2019ve lost my job and can\u2019t find another one,\u201d a weeping woman told Ms. Szydlo at the Amor Wedding House. \u201cWhat can you offer me?\u201dMs. Szydlo did not address the woman\u2019s specific concerns, but she instead used the opportunity to take a swipe at the governing party.\u201cThose in power keep telling us that unemployment has been dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what? People in small towns don\u2019t have jobs. People over 50 can\u2019t find work. We are not going to feed our children with statistics.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting from Warsaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW\u2019s New Chief Says Scandal Will Cost It More Than Expected", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive warned on Tuesday that the financial impact from the company\u2019s emissions cheating scandal would be worse than previously acknowledged, forcing the company to curtail investment at a time when all carmakers are trying to keep ahead of a rush of new technology.The automaker previously said it would set aside 6.5 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion, to cover the cost of bringing vehicles with illegal software into compliance with emissions standards.\u201cBut that will not be enough,\u201d said Matthias M\u00fcller, the Volkswagen chief executive, adding that job cuts might be ahead.Mr. M\u00fcller said it was impossible to calculate the cost from penalties that Volkswagen was likely to face from governments \u2014 including state and federal authorities in the United States \u2014 or from lawsuits that are proliferating from unhappy customers and shareholders. About 11 million Volkswagen diesel vehicles, primarily in Europe and the United States, have software meant to fool emissions tests.For now, the company will review new projects and delay or cancel any that are not considered essential, Mr. M\u00fcller said, according to a text of his address to 20,000 employees gathered in a building at the company\u2019s main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany.His remarks point up how the crisis has expanded and troubled Volkswagen. The scandal might damage not only the company\u2019s current sales and its image, but it could also impinge on its ability to keep current with the fast-changing technology trends, which are forcing carmakers to continually reinvent their vehicles.Volkswagen could face significant financial restraints as it works on new technologies like self-driving vehicles and battery-powered cars. In addition to those advances, automakers are also bracing for competition from Silicon Valley. Mr. M\u00fcller referred to rumors that Apple would begin selling a car in the next few years.\u201cThis self-made crisis and its repercussions hit us at a time when mobility is undergoing broad changes,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said.On Wednesday, Volkswagen is scheduled to announce how it intends to alter the affected vehicles to meet emissions standards without cheating.There is deep skepticism within the auto industry that doing so will be easy or even possible. Particularly in the United States, where emissions standards are more stringent than in Europe, some industry experts say it could be hard for Volkswagen to make its cars follow the air-quality rules without drastically diminishing the cars\u2019 performance and fuel economy.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. M\u00fcller said that in some vehicles, reprogramming the software would suffice. Some cars will not need any repairs because the illegal software was not activated. But in other cases, the company will need to install new components, he said.Gennadi Zikoridse, executive director of the Research Association for Diesel Emission Control Technologies in Dresden, Germany, said he thought it would be technically possible to fix the affected vehicles, \u201cbut it won\u2019t be simple or cheap.\u201dMr. M\u00fcller, who was appointed chief executive last month after his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, resigned, did not rule out job cuts stemming from the damage that Volkswagen has suffered financially and to its reputation.The company will do everything it can to preserve jobs, Mr. M\u00fcller said, but he added: \u201cThis will not be a painless process.\u201dVolkswagen has almost 600,000 workers worldwide, including about 270,000 in Germany. The German work force is concentrated in the state of Lower Saxony, including 72,000 people at the Wolfsburg factory.Mr. M\u00fcller said a substantial number of high-ranking managers had been suspended in connection with what he promised would be a ruthless inquiry into who was responsible for the scandal.He did not name those executives suspended, but three of them \u2014 whose suspensions had been previously disclosed \u2014 played prominent roles in the development and deployment of the engines with the software.They are: Ulrich Hackenberg, head of development for all Volkswagen Group brands, and previously head of development for Volkswagen-brand cars from 2007 to 2013; Heinz-Jakob Neusser, currently head of development for the Volkswagen brand; and Wolfgang Hatz, head of engines and transmissions development for all Volkswagen brands.A spokesman for Porsche, a Volkswagen subsidiary where Mr. Hatz is also the head of research and development, said he was using the paid suspension to defend himself against the accusations.Mr. Hackenberg and Mr. Neusser did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s remarks suggest that the company believes approval for the cheating took place at a high level.\u201cEmployees who were not in leadership positions do not need to fear that they will be blamed for transgressions at management level,\u201d he said.For the first time on Tuesday, Volkswagen provided a breakdown of where most of the cars with illegal software are. The largest number, 2.8 million, are in Germany. An additional 1.2 million are in Britain, and 900,000 are in France. About 482,000 are in the United States.About five million are Volkswagen brand cars and 1.8 million are Volkswagen brand light commercial vehicles. An additional 2.1 million are Audi cars, while 1.2 million are Skodas and 700,000 are SEAT cars.At the same time, Mr. M\u00fcller did not seek to distance himself from Mr. Winterkorn, who resigned under pressure even while maintaining that he had no knowledge of the emissions cheating. Mr. M\u00fcller expressed gratitude to Mr. Winterkorn for \u201cwhat he has achieved in the past three decades for Volkswagen.\u201dVolkswagen has traditionally been reluctant to impose layoffs because one of its main shareholders, with a 20 percent stake, is the state of Lower Saxony, which has a strong economic and political interest in preserving local jobs.In addition, worker representatives at Volkswagen are powerful even by the standards of a country where employees are guaranteed a voice on corporate supervisory boards. Berthold Huber, former president of the IG Metall labor union, is acting chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board.Mr. Huber, who has been serving as temporary chairman since April, is expected to be replaced Wednesday by Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, an Austrian who is close to the majority shareholders, the Porsche family. The Volkswagen supervisory board is scheduled to meet Wednesday to appoint a new chairman.Bernd Osterloh, chairman of the Volkswagen workers council, which is separate from the union but works closely with it, said on Tuesday there would be no immediate consequences for Volkswagen workers, including temporary employees.But he added, \u201cRealistically, it is not yet possible to foresee how our customers will react to this scandal.\u201dThe German economy, which depends on exports of cars and machinery, is already feeling the effects of the economic slowdown in China and other developing countries. Orders to German factories unexpectedly fell by 1.8 percent in August from July, according to figures published Tuesday.The data covered a period before the emissions scandal broke. Any subsequent downturn in factory orders could reinforce fears that the damage to Volkswagen\u2019s image will infect other companies.\u201cThere is a risk the whole image of German engineering, of \u2018Made in Germany,\u2019 will come under suspicion,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Deal Isn\u2019t Boehner\u2019s \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019 but Gets Job Done", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 It is no grand bargain, but it is a big deal.The agreement, negotiated in secret by top congressional and White House aides, is a recognition by Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, that they were staring into a fiscal and political abyss.But Mr. McConnell has repeatedly promised no default. And he and Mr. Boehner, with their ties to high-ranking allies in the business and financial worlds, knew that failure to head off a threat to the government\u2019s creditworthiness could boomerang badly on Republicans just one year from Election Day.Now the tentative budget agreement gives the Republican leadership the chance to persuade a sufficient number of Republicans to join Democrats in approving an increase in the debt limit that should take the government into the administration of the next president.In fact, if approved, the deal does much more \u2014 both politically and substantively.With passage of the deal, Mr. Boehner would make good on his promise to clean out the barn a bit for Mr. Ryan and allow him time to get his feet under him as the new leader without having to face the nearly impossible job of rounding up votes for the debt limit increase.The question remains, however, if the deal will weaken the conservative standing of Mr. Ryan \u2014 and upset his looming election \u2014 whether he had a hand in the negotiations or not.And those conservative activists who helped push Mr. Boehner to an early retirement were not looking kindly on the agreement as details began to trickle out Monday. The group Heritage Action for America labeled Mr. Boehner a \u201crogue agent\u201d working for special interests in his final hours.\u201cIn Washington cleaning the barn is apparently synonymous with shoveling manure on the American people,\u201d said Michael A. Needham, the head of the group, which is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation.On the policy side, it potentially buys Republicans, congressional Democrats and the White House two years of relative budget peace by setting agreed-upon spending limits for this year and next, getting both parties through the election with a legislative truce that spares them tough political votes. It will then be up to the next Congress and president to renew the budget wars \u2014 or not.Lawmakers of both parties frustrated with the haphazard way Congress has performed its fundamental duty of passing appropriations bills in recent years also see a real benefit in the budget deal. With spending levels set for the next two years, members of the appropriations committees believe they can return to the traditional process of crafting, debating and passing individual appropriations bills and have more impact on the way the government spends its money.It also provides one last opportunity to rile the conservatives who called for his scalp while acting in what he sees as the best interests of both the nation and the Republican Party. Mr. Boehner probably sees that as grand enough.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Writers Return Awards to Protest Government Silence on Violence", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The novelist Nayantara Sahgal said she was returning India\u2019s highest literary honor to express sympathy for \u201call dissenters who now live in fear and uncertainty.\u201d G. S. Bhullar, a short-story author, said he was giving back the same award to protest the \u201cviolent retrogressive forces dictating terms in the field of literature and culture.\u201d Mandakranta Sen, a Bengali poet, said she was sending her award back to protest \u201cattacks on rationalists.\u201dThe revolt now presents Mr. Modi with a critical test of his vaunted ability to shape the public narrative of his administration. Perhaps more than any crisis he has faced since becoming prime minister 17 months ago, this one is offering a kind of X-ray of Mr. Modi\u2019s carefully cultivated persona both here and abroad.Is he a Twitter-savvy technocrat obsessed with boosting development for all India by slashing red tape, wooing foreign investors and building a modern digital economy? Or is he a canny ideologue intent on imposing a strict Hindu code of values on a nation that prides itself on tolerance, diversity and pluralism?\u201cMr. Modi talks all these tall words abroad, on foreign soil,\u201d said Mangalesh Dabral, a poet who is returning his award from 2000. \u201cAll the sermonizing, this talk of the great digital India and the dreams he shows to people. All of it seems plain boasting because enactment of these tall words is invisible in his behavior and words inside the country, on his homeland.\u201dOne of Mr. Modi\u2019s favorite modes of communicating is Twitter, where he has 15 million followers and more than 9,500 posts. On Twitter, Mr. Modi presents himself as cheerleader in chief for all things India, celebrating achievements, sending birthday greetings and offering condolences. Yet, as many commentators have pointed out, not one of his Twitter posts has offered condolences to the Ikhlaq family, which was brutally attacked by a Hindu mob last month in a village 30 miles east of Delhi.Uday Prakash, a renowned Hindi writer, was the first author to renounce his award from the academy, in September. \u201cI have never seen such hostility before,\u201d he said.In interviews this week, the writers returned to the same refrain: That Mr. Modi\u2019s failure to confront intolerance by fellow Hindu nationalists is giving tacit permission for more intolerance. \u201cThe tide of violence against freedom of speech is rising every day,\u201d Ms. Sahgal said.On Tuesday, Mr. Modi for the first time directly addressed the Sept. 28 attack that left Mr. Ikhlaq dead. During an interview with the Bengali language newspaper Anandabazar Patrika, Mr. Modi called Mr. Ikhlaq\u2019s death \u201creally sad,\u201d and emphasized that his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., \u201cnever supports such incidents.\u201dBut he also accused political opponents of trying to exploit Mr. Ikhlaq\u2019s death. \u201cThe B.J.P. has always opposed pseudosecularism,\u201d he said. \u201cOpposition regularly alleges B.J.P. of igniting communal flare. But isn\u2019t the opposition doing polarization now?\u201dWhile Mr. Modi did not address the writers\u2019 revolt, his allies have been merciless. Rakesh Sinha, an unofficial spokesman for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the B.J.P., said the writers were \u201cfrustrated communist cadres\u201d who had long opposed the \u201ccultural nationalism\u201d embraced by Mr. Modi\u2019s supporters.He noted that at least two of the writers who returned awards signed an open letter warning that Mr. Modi\u2019s election as prime minister in 2014 would give rise to bigotry and violence. \u201cThey are not in a position to accept someone like Mr. Modi,\u201d he said in an interview.In a lengthy post on Facebook, Mr. Modi\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, ridiculed the protests as political sour grapes by leftist writers still reeling from \u201cthe shrinking fortunes\u201d of their traditional government patrons, the Indian National Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.\u201cA few questions to the protesters: How many of them courted arrest, protested or raised their voice against the dictatorship of Mrs. Indira Gandhi during the emergency?\u201cWith the Congress showing no signs of revival and an insignificant Left lacking legislative relevance, the recipients of past patronage are now resorting to \u2018politics by other means,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Jaitley added. \u201cThe manufactured protest of the writers is one such case.\u201dSeveral writers scoffed at the idea that the protests have a hidden political motive. Some pointed out that several Indian writers were jailed during the state of emergency declared by Mrs. Gandhi in 1975. Mr. Rushdie, a British citizen who was born in India, wryly noted that it was the Congress party that banned his novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d in 1988. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of any political party,\u201d he said.And yet G.N. Devy, a writer from Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, Gujarat, said a government official recently visited and politely quizzed him for an hour about his decision to return his award. He said the official asked about the political aims and organization of the writers\u2019 protest. He said he told the official that there was no organization.\u201cMy protest is not against any government, but to make the point that the Constitution of this country needs to be fully protected,\u201d he said in an interview.It is the kind of encounter that has become more common under Mr. Modi, in part because his ascendancy to prime minister has been accompanied by growing activism from conservative Hindu nationalists who seek to suppress forms of expression they view as offensive to their religion. They have pressured publishers to withdraw books, pushed universities to remove texts from syllabuses and filed criminal complaints against those they deem to have insulted Hinduism.Few writers have drawn more criticism than M.M. Kalburgi, a noted rationalist scholar who enraged far-right Hindu nationalists through his criticism of idol worship and superstition. Mr. Kalburgi said he received multiple death threats, and on Aug. 30 was shot dead at point-blank range in his home in Karnataka, a state in southern India. No arrests have been made.Mr. Kalburgi\u2019s death created a fierce debate among members of the National Academy of Letters. Mr. Kalburgi had been a member of the academy\u2019s general council, and he received an award from the academy in 2006 for a collection of his academic research. Yet the academy issued no formal statements condemning Mr. Kalburgi\u2019s murder.That silence is what led Uday Prakash to be the first to return his award. \u201cWriters are a family, but they don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d he explained.In addition to the 35 writers giving back their awards, at least five others have announced their resignations from the academy. But not all academy members support the protests.\u201cFor so many years, you take advantage of the prestige of the academy and now you want to return the award?\u201d said one member, Govind Mishra. \u201cThere is no sense to this. There are so many other pressing issues. Farmers are killing themselves. Nobody thought of giving their awards back for them.\u201dVishwanath Prasad Tiwari, the academy\u2019s president, said in an interview that the protesting writers had been misled into believing that the academy had been silent in the face of intolerance and violence.He pointed out that the vice president of the academy presided over a tribute for Mr. Kalburgi last month. The tribute celebrated Mr. Kalburgi\u2019s contributions as a writer and scholar, but also included forceful condemnations of his murder. \u201cHow can anyone say the academy did not react?\u201d Mr. Tiwari asked. \u201cThe vice president himself is Kalburgi\u2019s friend. Have they ever demanded like this for any other writer?\u201dMr. Tiwari said he is convening an emergency meeting this month to discuss the protests and what can be done to stop writers from returning their awards. \u201cThe storm that has been set in motion by this protest needs to be dealt with,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Saves 240 as Boat With Migrants Capsizes", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Mounting one of its biggest rescue operations in the Aegean Sea this year, the Greek Coast Guard on Wednesday saved some 240 migrants after a large wooden smuggling boat capsized in high winds off the Greek island of Lesbos, killing three people, including two children. The search continued late into the night in a bid to find more survivors.\u201cIt\u2019s a big wreck; we don\u2019t often see this,\u201d a Coast Guard official on Lesbos said by telephone, noting that most boats dispatched by smugglers from Turkey to Greece carry \u201c40 or 80 people.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen boats with 160 or 170 but that\u2019s rare,\u201d he added. Inflatable dinghies have been the smugglers\u2019 preferred vessel up to now. The official refused to speculate on whether the type of vessel used this time and the number of passengers aboard marked a new tactic by the smugglers.\u201cIt was bad weather; thankfully we had boats nearby and the response was quick,\u201d said the official who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.The three people confirmed dead were a man and two boys, a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old. No details were available about their country of origin.In total, eight migrants died on Wednesday in attempts to cross the Aegean from Turkey, according to the Greek Shipping Ministry, which cited four separate wrecks: two off Lesbos and two off Samos, another Greek island. Of the eight dead, six were children.The dramatic day at sea added to a grim catalog of deaths in the Aegean, a crossing point for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing strife or otherwise seeking a better life. The worsening weather did not appear to have deterred the migrants, or those who arranged their passage in vessels that are often dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy.The spread of the conflict in Syria and growing fears that more Balkan countries will close their borders to migrants seeking to travel to Northern and Western Europe appear to have spurred the latest wave of migration. On Wednesday, the Austrian interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said the country was planning to erect a fence along its border with Slovenia, something Chancellor\u00a0Werner Faymann later denied.This summer, as the Majid family left Syria for Europe, The New York Times followed the group through weeks of defeat and triumph, disillusionment and determination.Although there are no exact figures for drownings in the Aegean, the Greek Coast Guard issues daily reports on migrants who have been found dead or reported missing. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 3,000 people have died or are missing after crossing into Europe this year.With more than half a million people arriving in Greece so far this year, the authorities acknowledge being overwhelmed and have appealed for European Union support.In cash-strapped Greece, which is still struggling to revive its economy, the authorities are scrambling to find facilities to accommodate thousands of migrants. Sports venues used for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens are among the options being considered.Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas has emphasized in recent days that Greece will not become \u201ca large concentration camp for refugees,\u201d noting that the Greek authorities had rejected calls by European officials for the creation of a large camp in the Greek capital.An earlier version of this article misstated the day that Austria announced that it planned to build a fence along its border with Slovenia. It was Wednesday, not Sunday.Advertisement"}

Thank you.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)...how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I\u2019ve had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly. But we found ways to work together on everything from...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) ... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do. Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill. Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision. I voted against it. I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that. We\u2019re not going to let it continue.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)...in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues. You know, I \u2014 I agree completely. We don\u2019t want American troops on the ground in Syria. I never said that. What I said was we had to put together a coalition \u2014 in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department \u2014 to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region. Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. So I think while you\u2019re talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran \u2014 I think I have a lot of evidence...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)Lots of things coming from all directions.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)The three leading Democratic presidential candidates overlap significantly in their positions on key issues, each pushing a liberal agenda by different degrees.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Let me say \u2014 let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I know that plays well in this room. But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you\u2019ve said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?(APPLAUSE)Governor O\u2019Malley...(APPLAUSE)Governor, it\u2019s popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers. Governor O\u2019Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, \u201cbeing defined by Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\u201d You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?(CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Check the record. In the 1990s \u2014 and all due respect \u2014 in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, \u201cwhat a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,\u201d Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation.

So I\u2019m...(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown. Despite that, you still voted against it. As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country\u2019s financial stability?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)(CROSS TALK)(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)Others have not. Does that influence \u2014 does it influence their views on legalization? Find out that and others ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties \u2014 100,000 people in this country \u2014 watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)(APPLAUSE)Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats. You\u2019re pro-coal, you\u2019re pro-offshore drilling, you\u2019re pro-Keystone pipeline. Are \u2014 again, are you \u2014 the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?(APPLAUSE)...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively. This is a moral issue. We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia.(APPLAUSE)We should not be paralyzed \u2014 we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, \u201cbig government this, big government that,\u201d that except for what they want to impose on the American people. I know we can afford it, because we\u2019re going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, the secretary is right. Republicans tell us we can\u2019t do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That\u2019s not what the American people want.You\u2019ve said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn\u2019t quite work for you. If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote?(APPLAUSE)And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(LAUGHTER)(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)On this stage \u2014 on this stage, you didn\u2019t hear anyone denigrate women, you didn\u2019t hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn\u2019t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief. What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you\u2019ve become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you\u2019ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.(APPLAUSE)That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faith in an Unregulated Free Market? Don\u2019t Fall for It", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPerhaps the most widely admired of all the economic theories taught in our universities is the notion that an unregulated competitive economy is optimal for everyone.In this optimal economy, each person is said to be a free actor who makes decisions purely in his or her own self-interest. Economists on both the right and left commonly say that these fundamental ideas tie our values of freedom and individuality to the success of our economies.The problem is that these ideas are flawed. Along with George A. Akerlof, university professor at Georgetown and a fellow Nobel laureate in economic science, I have used behavioral economics to plumb the soundness of these notions.But, at the same time, we both believe that standard economic theory is typically overenthusiastic about unregulated free markets. It usually ignores the fact that, given normal human weaknesses, an unregulated competitive economy will inevitably spawn an immense amount of manipulation and deception.We use the word \u201cphishing\u201d as a metaphor for a range of seemingly harmless modern market manipulations \u2014 like putting candy bars and gossip magazines at the checkout counter, where bored or tired adults and the parents of whining children will be tempted to spend a few extra dollars. And we coined the word \u201cphool\u201d to describe someone who does not understand how much thought and effort have gone into manipulating him or her.These activities are widespread not because people in business generally have evil motives, but because of the existence of market forces \u2014 a phishing equilibrium enforced by competition. It works this way: When you realize that your competitor has used sophisticated and effective marketing tricks, then you will fall behind if you don\u2019t follow suit.Many economists see evidence of manipulation and deception in the marketplace, but most do not view the phenomena as a fundamental and ubiquitous problem with unregulated free markets. Deception and manipulation are inadequately discussed in textbooks on theory. As a result, market regulation is excessively maligned.We see things differently: The success of the United States economy \u2014 and of those similar to it \u2014 can be attributed both to the relative freedom of its markets and to the fact that common-sense regulation has been imposed on them. Fortunately, many countries\u2019 civil societies have injected a sense of morality into market activities.The Thatcher-Reagan revolution a third of a century ago was a turning point away from market regulation, with mixed results. But the academic world\u2019s formalization of free markets into mathematical economics supported that revolution with limited reservations.It\u2019s worth noting, though, that the first protest came from Pareto himself. He did not intend to use his insights in the manner in which they are commonly employed today. Pareto observed that his concept of optimality neglected some important moral dimensions: People in free markets do not really manage to maximize what the philosopher Jeremy Bentham would call their utility. They don\u2019t always succeed in maximizing their true welfare, but something else, something much more limited.In the first half of the 20th century, such critiques were of general interest. But they are little discussed today.Current economic theory does recognize that if there is an \u201cexternality\u201d \u2014 say, a business polluting the air in the course of producing the goods it sells \u2014 the outcome won\u2019t be optimal, and most economists would agree that in such cases we need government intervention.But the problem of market-incentivized professional manipulation and deception is fundamental, not an externality. In short, the superiority of untrammeled free markets \u2014 the fundamental theorem of welfare economics \u2014 has taken on the aura of a law from the heavens. Yet technology has advanced so that temptations are being manipulated ever more effectively.In fact, the real success of economies that embody free markets has much to do with the heroic efforts of campaigners for better values, both among private organizations and advocates of government regulation. For example, before 1900 most of the patent medicines that were sold to the public were fraudulent.Unfortunately, such giants have not become truly famous and have been largely forgotten. Contemporary heroes tend more often to be entertainers or businesspeople who are little more than masters of manipulation. Maybe the reason is that the heroes\u2019 criticism ignites doubt about many of our own day-to-day activities.We have lapsed into a mode of thought that glorifies free markets and belittles economic heroism. We need those markets, but we need real heroes, too.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Sets Course for U.S.-Style Lending to Stimulate Growth", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean Union financial officials on Wednesday laid out plans for making more sources of investment available to European business, as a way to encourage American-style venture capital and fund-raising in the region.The plan, promoted by Jonathan Hill, a Briton who had business ties to the London finance industry and is now the European commissioner overseeing financial markets, is meant to stimulate growth in Europe. But parts of the proposal would require the approval of European Union governments and lawmakers, and could take years to come to fruition, if it ever does.European business has long been more dependent than American companies on a primary source \u2014 financing by banks \u2014 to fund business. There is also a patchwork of regulations across Europe making it hard for companies to line up other forms of financing.Small and medium-size businesses get about five times as much funding from capital markets in the United States as they do in Europe, according to the European Commission, which is the administrative arm of the European Union.The bank-funding model is particularly common in Germany, although some other countries, particularly Britain, have already created a wider range of alternatives to bring together investors and businesses.Critics of Mr. Hill contend that he aims to make all of the European Union operate too much like the more American-style British system and to use the effort as a tool to deregulate the financial sector.The main idea behind the proposals introduced on Wednesday is to create a so-called capital markets union that would force structural changes in the European Union economy and make it easier for start-ups and other businesses to cross borders within Europe to secure the funding they need from sources available in other member states.To encourage more participation of venture capital funds in the European economy, Mr. Hill proposed relaxing rules that often prevent such funds from operating across national borders and make them less expensive to operate.The current lack of options means \u201cmany European ideas are heading offshore to markets where funding is easier to come by,\u201d Mr. Hill warned.The proposals received a broadly positive reception from the financial industry on Wednesday.And the plan was hailed by the British government, which expects the City of London to benefit as a global financial hub.\u201cIf we get this right, all of Europe will gain,\u201d Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the British Treasury, said in a statement. \u201cGreater capital markets union will also strengthen financial stability and create new opportunity for financial services, which Britain is particularly well-placed to benefit from.\u201dBut there was skepticism from Burkhard Balz, a lawmaker at the European Parliament from Germany, where the strongly entrenched bank-lending sector fears its role could be undermined.\u201cBank credits will continue to have a central role in Europe,\u201d Mr. Balz, who sits on the Parliament\u2019s influential Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe do not want to Americanize businesses\u2019 access to finance.\u2019\u2019Asked about those concerns, Mr. Hill said that \u201cno one is seeking to copy and paste the American system.\u201d He also suggested that introducing new funding channels would \u201cfree up bank balance sheets\u201d in countries like Germany and allow them to continue lending to small businesses.The proposed steps could also help an aging population in Europe to plan and save for retirement, Mr. Hill said, by creating new ways for private savers\u2019 money to be pooled into investment funds.One component of the plan, which could prove to be one of the more controversial, is to revive financial tools that were in use before the financial crisis erupted in 2008 and were subsequently reined in by regulators.That includes a draft law Mr. Hill introduced on Wednesday for securitization \u2014 the process of slicing up loans, like mortgages, and packaging them into bondlike instruments \u2014 to encourage that activity while ensuring adequate regulatory oversight to protect investors.The legislation is aimed at make it easier for investors to understand where they are putting their money, and remove some complexity, when they invest in securitized assets. Rebuilding that market could inject investment worth 100 billion euros, or $112 billion, into the European economy, according to the commission.\u201cThe commission has rightly recognized that to make Europe more competitive, it should support market-driven solutions,\u201d said Matthew Fell, the director for competitive markets at the CBI, an industry association in Britain.Mr. Hill on Wednesday also proposed amending an existing law that governs insurance companies, in order to lower their capital-reserve requirements when they invest in major infrastructure projects like highways and telecommunications networks, to encourage that activity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Pushes Back Against U.S. Influence in the Seas of East Asia", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BeijingChina, analysts say, is seeking to establish a sphere of influence in these waters \u2014 and edge out the United States.What that means \u2014 whether it represents a crisis, or a natural and inevitable shift given China\u2019s economic strength \u2014 depends on whom you ask. But there is little doubt that China is thinking big about how these islands could limit America\u2019s military options, about how control over these waters could give it leverage over key trade routes and about how making the United States look hapless could strengthen its diplomatic clout in the region.\u201cThey have a game plan; it is very clear what it is,\u201d said Christopher K. Johnson, senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington at a recent seminar. \u201cSometimes, I think it is easy to get lost in the weeds on what has been built on which island.\u201dThe United States sent ships and planes to the Taiwan Strait with impunity during a crisis 20 years ago in what was considered a strategic backyard for American forces. It would be much more difficult today for the United States to act in the same manner, Mr. Johnson said.To achieve its goals, China is spending heavily on its navy, including on nuclear-powered submarines. The construction of a second aircraft carrier is underway to supplement the first carrier, launched in 2012. Its Coast Guard is growing rapidly and now has the world\u2019s largest cutter, a 10,000-metric-ton vessel built at the Jiangnan Shipyard, where its builders nicknamed it the \u201cmonster.\u201dShipbuilding for China\u2019s Coast Guard is so robust that the fleet now has more than three times as many ships than had been planned just a few years ago, said Ryan D. Martinson, research administrator at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College in Newport, R.I.The buildup of maritime power means China, traditionally a continental power, is transforming its capabilities in an effort to secure its interests along the vital sea lanes that pass from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca and across the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Middle East into Europe. Much of China\u2019s commercial trade and energy supplies travel that route.How the South China Sea would operate with a dominant China is a matter of debate.Does China want to threaten foreign powers with force if they intervene, a model fashioned after the Monroe Doctrine, asked M. Taylor Fravel, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If the goal was to try to exclude the United States, then China\u2019s actions so far have been counterproductive, he said.Mr. Fravel suggested that the free flow of shipping through the South China Sea was not incompatible with greater Chinese influence in the region.\u201cIf the attraction of China\u2019s economy and of Chinese investment is one source of political influence, China has few incentives to interfere with the international waterways in the South China Sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, such interference would likely weaken China\u2019s influence and not enhance it. If China aspires to greater influence in the region, its ability to achieve and maintain that influence requires ensuring an open, dynamic trading system that links Asia with other regions.\u201dThe United States is trying to persuade China to sustain the post-World War II operating system in Asia \u2014 freedom of navigation, peaceful settlement of disputes and fidelity of contracts \u2014 that has given Asia perhaps its best four or five decades in 1,000 years, Mr. Campbell said. But now the Chinese are saying the status quo no longer holds in the South China Sea. It is natural, but worrying, that as a rising power challenging the existing order, China wants to put its \u201cown stamp on things,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you listen very carefully to Chinese friends, they are saying this is no longer an international waterway,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cThat we will provide safety for the ships transmitting this water. My own personal view is that this is antithetical to our strategic interests and in fact antithetical to Chinese strategic interests.\u201dDespite concerns in the United States, it is not in China\u2019s interests to use force to get its way in the South China Sea, said Wu Xinbo, director of the center of American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cIt would be foolish for China to use force on other claimants in the South China Sea. The political and strategic cost is too high.\u201dChina\u2019s objectives are not necessarily sinister and from its point of view represent a \u201csensible\u201d strategic approach, said former Rear Adm. Michael McDevitt, now a senior fellow at CNA, a nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Va.\u201cSince the South China Sea was the traditional route the West used on the way to invading, China wants to make sure that eventually they can establish sea control in the South China Sea in times of conflict,\u201d Mr. McDevitt said, referring to Britain and other European powers. \u201cIt is our job to make sure that they cannot keep us at bay should there be a conflict.\u201dHugh White, a critic of the United States\u2019 response to China\u2019s growing power whose message is unpopular in Washington but well received among Chinese analysts, said China\u2019s short-term goal in the South China Sea was to throw its weight around and to show America\u2019s allies that Washington was unable to respond effectively.But the action was too timid, he said. The destroyer traveled within 12 nautical miles of the new island, and then left quietly and quickly, and American officials were barred from describing it in any detail. It left the opposite impression of being strong in the face of a determined power and allowed the Chinese to move ahead undeterred, he said.\u201cIt showed just how reluctant Washington is to stand up to China for fear of provoking a crisis,\u201d Mr. White said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Big Challenge: Fix Bad Loans Without Destroying Banks", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Apostolis Paliouras was proud of the bookstore he ran on the ground floor of an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood here. Greek authors came to give readings and sign their works. People gathered to debate matters literary and political.But his sales plummeted in 2011 after the Greek government, bowing to demands from its international creditors, imposed a new property tax and added it to utility bills in an attempt to stem the country\u2019s notorious tax evasion. People who did not pay risked having their power shut off. The tax crackdown crippled consumer spending.\u201cPeople were buying books, and then they stopped,\u201d Mr. Paliouras, 63, recalled recently. \u201cThey just stopped.\u201dThe tax problem quickly bled into another of Greece\u2019s economic afflictions. In 2012, Mr. Paliouras was forced to close the bookstore and, with his main source of income gone, he was no longer able to meet mortgage payments on the home he shares with his wife. And so he joined a group that has lately grown to catastrophic proportions in Greece: loan delinquents.Although dealing with delinquent loans is one of the biggest challenges facing the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the country\u2019s creditors, the issue is so knotty that it was not included in the bundle of economic reforms the Greek Parliament was debating this week. Instead, it will be taken up later.Officially, more than 40 percent of loans issued by Greek banks are seriously in arrears. By some estimates, the rate tops 50 percent, if loans that have gone sour in recent months are included. That is one of the highest rates in the world, and it has so weakened the Greek banking system that it raises doubts about the country\u2019s ability to mount an economic recovery. (The comparable figure in the United States is only 2 percent.)Despite Greece\u2019s latest international bailout, worth as much as 86 billion euros \u2014 or about $98 billion \u2014 the country cannot rebound if its banks are flailing. The effects could be felt throughout the eurozone financial system and all the way to Wall Street.A big challenge for Greece is how to address the bad-loan problem in a way that offers some hope to debtors like Mr. Paliouras, yet does not destroy the banking system. That is why the government has deferred action on the issue for now.Big American investors who are sharing the pain include the billionaires Wilbur Ross and John Paulson, whose investment funds have made big bets on Greek banks, along with Fidelity Investments and Capital Group. Those investors have already suffered paper losses because of steep declines in the value of Greek bank shares, and they could lose more if bad loans wipe out more bank capital.The latest international aid package for Greece includes up to \u20ac25 billion to replenish the capital of Greek banks. According to rough estimates circulating in Athens, banks might need only \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac15 billion in new capital \u2014 essentially the banks\u2019 cushion against losses. But senior bankers in Athens acknowledge that no one yet knows for sure how bad the loan losses will prove.In any country, the number of bad loans will rise when recession causes businesses to close and people to lose their jobs. But in Greece the effect has been extreme, given the depth and duration of the economic slump.What\u2019s more, bad loans are not only a symptom of recession but also a cause of further economic malaise, tying up money that might otherwise be lent to healthier companies. In Greece, about 40 percent of the bad loans are to small, one-person businesses or midsize businesses such as fish farms or ferry operators. Those smaller and midsize businesses are a critical source of jobs in Greece, which has relatively few large corporations.\u201cA high level of nonperforming loans means a lot of resources are trapped in unproductive parts of the economy,\u201d said Platon Monokroussos, deputy general manager of Eurobank Ergasias, one of Greece\u2019s biggest banks.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.And the cycle can feed on itself. Fears that banks would go bust from bad loans were a main reason that Greeks drained their accounts en masse. Depositors withdrew \u20ac40 billion from December to July, forcing the government to place restrictions on the amount of cash that Greeks could withdraw from their bank accounts.The restrictions, still in place though slightly relaxed, crimped consumer spending, further slowing the economy and leading to more bad loans. The task ahead for bankers and bank regulators is to break the vicious circle.But doing so will be extremely difficult. Under pressure from creditors, the Greek Parliament has already passed laws that will give Greek banks more power to seize property and a speedier legal process for claims. Those changes were meant to reduce the waiting time for court hearings, which had reached more than a decade, and to spur debtors who might have the money to pay their loans but don\u2019t bother because it has been so difficult for banks to foreclose.Bankers say they will use the increased powers to work out payment plans with debtors whenever possible, and that they have no interest in seizing property in a depressed real estate market.But debtors are suspicious, and they are numerous enough to form a powerful constituency that adds a dash of volatility to Greece\u2019s already unstable politics.Stella Heliopoulou, president of an organization that represents bank debtors, said that people asking banks for help are often offered new loans to pay off the old ones, rather than a break on the debt.Ms. Heliopoulou likened the behavior of the banks to eurozone creditors who are lending the Greek government money to pay existing debts \u2014 which is mainly what the latest bailout plan is meant to do.\u201cWhat the creditors are doing to the country the banks are doing to the citizens,\u201d she said, speaking in the small office in Athens, furnished with little more than a table and an electric fan, that serves as her group\u2019s headquarters.Apostolis Panousopoulos, secretary general of the debtors\u2019 organization, said he tried to negotiate with his bank to get easier terms on \u20ac18,000 in debt he built up on a credit line from his bank. The debt has an 18 percent interest rate. He noted that Greek banks were able to borrow money from the European Central Bank at interest rates of a little more than 1 percent.\u201cI personally went to the bank branch, and I got nothing,\u201d said Mr. Panousopoulos, 67, who owned a small ceramics manufacturing company but is now retired. He and his wife live on a pension of \u20ac1,500 a month.The European Central Bank, which has supervisory responsibility for Greek banks and has been keeping them alive with emergency loans, has begun poring through loan portfolios to determine just how bad the damage is. That is the first step in determining how much capital banks need to remain viable.The process is a delicate one. The bank cleanup must be tough enough to be credible. \u201cNonperforming loans have to be dealt with in order to restore confidence in banks,\u201d as well as to reduce the burden on households and businesses, said Anthimos Thomopoulos, the chief executive of Piraeus Bank, another big Greek lender.But Wall Street investors have been meeting with European Central Bank officials to lobby them not to be too tough, if they want the banks to raise any more capital from the private sector. Capital provided by the eurozone bailout fund, via the Greek bank rescue authority, will dilute the value of existing bank shares whose prices on the stock market have already plunged.Some of Greece\u2019s bad loans will go away by themselves if the economy improves, and people and businesses begin earning money to make payments.

{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau and Liberal Party Prevail With Stunning Rout in Canada", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting with a sweep of the Atlantic provinces, the Liberals capitalized on what many Canadians saw as Mr. Harper\u2019s heavy-handed style, and the party went on to capture 184 of the 338 seats in the next House of Commons. The unexpected rout occurred 47 years after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, first swept to power.Justin Trudeau, who will be 44 on Christmas Day, will become Canada\u2019s second-youngest prime minister and the first to follow a parent into office.While the Liberal Party had emerged on top in several polls over the past week, its lead was short of conclusive and Mr. Trudeau was an untested figure. There was no ambiguity, however, in Monday\u2019s results.\u201cMore than a hundred years ago a great prime minister, Wilfrid Laurier, talked about sunny ways, he knew that politics can be a positive force and that is the message Canadians sent today,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told supporters in Montreal. \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways, this is what positive politics can do.\u201d\u201cThe disappointment you all so feel, is my responsibility and mine alone,\u201d he said. While Mr. Harper made no mention of his plans, the Conservative Party issued a statement saying that he had resigned as its leader.The election became something of a referendum on Mr. Harper\u2019s approach to government, which, in the view of his critics, has often focused on issues important to core Conservative supporters, mostly in the West, rather than to much of the population.Dominic LeBlanc, a prominent Liberal member of Parliament who was handily re-elected in New Brunswick, attributed the party\u2019s extraordinary revival, following a period during which many people forecast its extinction, to Mr. Trudeau, who became the party\u2019s leader in 2013.\u201cI hope what this tells us is Canadians across the country have responded positively to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s positive message,\u201d Mr. LeBlanc told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.The younger Mr. Trudeau proved as adept as his father in attracting crowds, and he, too, had a flamboyant streak \u2014 taking part in celebrity boxing matches. As votes were being counted in Ontario and Quebec, the provinces that account for about two-thirds of Canada\u2019s population, the extent of the Liberals\u2019 win was still not fully clear. It is a remarkable turnaround for the Liberals. During the last election in 2011, the party fell to third place for the first time in its history, holding just 34 seats. Even before all of the voting ended on Monday, the party had won or was leading in 152 electoral districts. The Conservatives had won or were leading 95 seats and the New Democratic Party had 25.While the Canadian election was initially met with summer-vacation indifference when it was called on Aug. 2, the dramatic ending appeared to have attracted voter interest.Turnout fell to as low as 58.8 percent in 2008 and was 61.1 percent in the last parliamentary elections, in 2011. The agency that supervises federal elections reported that 68.5 percent of the country\u2019s 25.6 million voters cast ballots in this election.News reports indicated that voters faced unusually long lines at some of the 66,000 polling stations on Monday. A rush of traffic temporarily overwhelmed the website of Elections Canada, the agency responsible for federal votes.Many analysts have said that Mr. Harper set a campaign period of twice the usual length in the hope that the more voters saw of Mr. Trudeau during his first term as leader of the Liberals, the less they would like him. Early Conservative ads emphasized Mr. Trudeau\u2019s relative political inexperience and concluded with the slogan, \u201cJust not ready.\u201dIf that was the case, it backfired.Although Mr. Trudeau has been prone to occasional verbal slips since assuming his leadership role, including the use of a vulgar metaphor in response to Mr. Harper\u2019s decision to commit Royal Canadian Air Force fighters to the multinational campaign against the Islamic State, he has grown in stature over the course of the election.He proved able at crucial events, like a debate on foreign policy, where even some Liberals feared that he might stumble. Late in the campaign, the Liberals flipped the Conservative slogan to \u201cReady\u201d in its ads.In a symbol of the Liberals\u2019 confidence, Mr. Trudeau used part of his final day of campaigning on Sunday to visit Alberta, Mr. Harper\u2019s adopted province and the Conservative Party\u2019s power base. An energy program introduced in 1980 by the elder Mr. Trudeau had for decades made the Liberal Party almost toxic in the province, which is dominated by the oil and gas industry. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s stops included Calgary, Mr. Harper\u2019s hometown and a place that has not elected a Liberal since 1968.That victory 47 years ago was part of a wave of Liberal triumphs that became known as Trudeaumania.After spending most of the campaign delivering standard speeches to invitation-only crowds, Mr. Harper took a more theatrical approach in the final days. At campaign stops, as he recited his party\u2019s claims of what a Liberal government would cost individual families, a recording of an old-fashioned cash register bell repeatedly pealed through loudspeakers and audience members piled what appeared to be currency on tables.Tom Mulcair, the leader of the New Democratic Party, who had insisted that the election should be focused on removing the Conservatives from power, devoted much of the final hours to attacking the Liberals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gas Discovery in Egypt Threatens to Upend Mideast Energy Diplomacy", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEni will need to drill more wells to prove its claim that the field, which it calls Zohr, holds up to 30 trillion cubic feet of gas. That could be worth about $100 billion, even when taking into account current low energy prices. But the promise of Zohr \u2014 the Arabic word for noon \u2014 is already brightening the prospects of the Egyptian economy, which has been benighted by an energy shortage and years of political turmoil.As with so many things in the Middle East, however, the discovery of the gas field has geopolitical repercussions. And it has thrust Eni\u2019s chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, into the role of shuttle diplomat.Mr. Descalzi met recently with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to discuss next steps. And on Thursday, the Eni chief plans to visit Jerusalem in an effort to persuade the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that there are still opportunities for Egypt and Israel to jointly prosper by developing their gas fields.Even before the Zohr discovery, Israeli officials had been divided over how to proceed on the gas front. And the government has been distracted lately by a wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.But Mr. Descalzi says he envisions Israel and Egypt eventually collaborating, exporting gas to Europe and other parts of the world, perhaps in the form of transportable liquefied natural gas. He notes that nearby Cyprus, where another offshore gas field has been found, might be another candidate for a regional partnership.The Zohr field \u201chas created a big opportunity,\u201d Mr. Descalzi said in a recent interview. \u201cWe can make a big eastern Mediterranean hub.\u201dIn written answers to questions from The New York Times, the Egyptian minister of petroleum and mineral resources, Tarek el-Molla, outlined a similar vision. \u201cEgypt is eligible to play a significant strategic role with regard to gas discoveries in the East Mediterranean region,\u201d Mr. Molla wrote.Not everyone shares that optimism. But the Egyptian economy could use the lift.Egypt has a per-capita income of about $3,500 and is growing only about 3 percent a year. That is far too slow for the country to climb the development curve quickly enough to meet the needs of its 82 million people \u2014 and it is below the 5 percent growth rate achieved before the ouster of the country\u2019s longtime ruler, Hosni Mubarak, in 2011.But the Mubarak government\u2019s efforts to appease the populace by keeping energy prices artificially low had an unintended drawback: It diminished market incentives for the foreign companies that extracted much of the oil and gas. The Egyptian government also tended to be slow to pay the companies, further damping their enthusiasm. That is why Egypt has had to import oil and gas in recent years to meet its needs.The government of Mr. Sisi, who took power in 2013, has tried to fix that problem by raising domestic fuel prices and by cutting its back payments to oil companies by about half, to less than $3 billion. Earlier this year, the energy giant BP agreed to spend $12 billion to develop a large quantity of offshore gas for the Egyptian market. Now, the Eni discovery might stoke further interest in exploration, analysts say.With a big new supply of natural gas, Egypt might be able to stop burning oil to generate electricity and start exporting the petroleum instead. New domestic supplies of natural gas would help conserve scarce foreign currency resources and might spur investment in gas-fired factories and electric power plants. And natural gas exports might follow.\u201cEgypt has undergone a remarkable transformation of fortunes \u2014 it looks like it has got its energy policy back on track,\u201d said Martijn Murphy, an analyst at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh.But Egypt\u2019s good fortune could come at the expense of its much richer neighbor. Eni\u2019s trove could threaten Israel\u2019s ambitions to tap its own giant offshore gas field, called Leviathan.Israel is already self-sufficient in natural gas by dint of a smaller offshore field \u2014 Tamar, discovered in 2009 \u2014 that serves the country via pipeline. Noble Energy, an American company that operates Tamar for the Israeli government, discovered the bigger Leviathan field in Israeli waters in 2010. Leviathan has potential reserves far exceeding Israel\u2019s own needs.Encouraged by the Obama administration, Noble reached preliminary deals last year to export gas to both Egypt and Jordan, a move approved by Mr. Netanyahu as a way to earn money and strengthen ties with former enemies.Much of the Israeli gas for export would be converted to liquefied natural gas at two Egyptian facilities that are already in place on the Mediterranean coast. Those facilities have sat idle during Egypt\u2019s domestic shortage. But Mr. Descalzi, whose company co-owns one of the installations, predicted that Egypt would be interested in using the terminals to export gas obtained from Israel, from the Zohr field or eventually from Cyprus, and to send the product by ship to Europe and beyond.But negotiations to complete those deals have bogged down, in part because Israel\u2019s antitrust commissioner has been blocking development of the Leviathan field over concerns about giving Noble too dominant a role in the country\u2019s gas industry. Now some Israelis \u2014 including the country\u2019s energy minister \u2014 have worried aloud that their country has hesitated too long. With Zohr, they fear, Egypt might no longer see a need for the Leviathan gas.\u201cIf we continue to procrastinate,\u201d Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli energy minister, told Parliament in September, \u201cit is possible there will no longer be a need for Israeli gas in Egypt and Jordan.\u201dFor months, Mr. Netanyahu has been working to clear the way for Noble and its partners from the Delek Group, an Israeli conglomerate, to develop Leviathan in return for concessions that would include a reduced stake in Tamar.Israeli lawmakers approved the prime minister\u2019s proposal by a nonbinding vote in September. But Mr. Netanyahu, who holds a one-seat majority in Parliament, has not yet succeeded in persuading the economy minister, Aryeh Deri, to push through the agreement.Mr. Deri has said that he does not oppose the deal, but that he did not want to be the first Israeli economy minister to overrule an antitrust commissioner. To clear the way, Mr. Deri said in a television interview last weekend that he would be willing to resign.Noble says that once the Israeli government signs off, the company could lock up agreements with customers like Jordan and Egypt, and might be able by the end of the decade to have gas flowing from Leviathan.Analysts say there is still room for Israeli gas in Egypt\u2019s plans. But participants in the talks on Israeli gas exports say that Egyptian officials, buoyed by the Eni discovery, might now take a tougher line.Mr. Molla, the Egyptian minister, dismissed those concerns. \u201cIt is unlikely that the recently achieved Zohr discovery\u201d would affect negotiations between international companies operating in Egypt and those producing gas in Israel, he wrote.But Amit Mor, chief executive of Eco Energy, an Israeli consulting firm, said he worried that time might be passing Israel by. Unless the government moves quickly, he said, \u201cwe might lose an opportunity here.\u201dIsabel Kershner and David Kirkpatrick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Penny Pritzker Tackles Tough Assignments as Commerce Secretary", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe U.S. embargo, which only our Congress can overturn, limits what the president can do in changing our approach,\u201d Ms. Pritzker conceded. In the meantime, she said brightly, it was time to \u201cseize this historic opportunity.\u201dDespite the obstacles, Ms. Pritzker, 56, an heiress to the Hyatt Hotels Corporation fortune who started five ventures of her own, is uniquely positioned for the difficult mission of peeling away decades of hostility with Cuba and getting talks on commerce started. For that matter, her deep connections to the nation\u2019s business community and her long history with the president \u2014 nearly 20 years ago her son attended a Chicago basketball program run by Mr. Obama\u2019s brother-in-law \u2014 make her a vital ambassador for a president who has often infuriated Wall Street and corporate America.Her trip to Cuba, the 33rd country she has visited in her two years as commerce secretary, comes as Ms. Pritzker is taking on another tough assignment for Mr. Obama: trying to sell Congress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade agreement in history, which was completed on Monday and faces opposition among Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton. She has also pressed for and won high-level strategic and commercial talks with India and routinely buttonholes foreign leaders about the concerns of American companies.When President Xi Jinping of China traveled to the United States last month, it was Ms. Pritzker who met him in Seattle and delivered a sharp message, warning Mr. Xi that his country had to treat American companies fairly if he wanted to see further economic cooperation.Ms. Pritzker, who is worth $2.4 billion and is an active philanthropist, has also reached out to Silicon Valley. When Airbnb, the online short-term home-rental company, announced it was expanding to Cuba, Ms. Pritzker picked up the phone and called Brian Chesky, the chief executive, to congratulate him and followed up with an email offering support.\u201cIn some ways, I think of her as almost like one of us,\u201d said Mr. Chesky, whom Ms. Pritzker recruited to join a program she started for Mr. Obama that recruits American executives to promote entrepreneurship in the United States and overseas. \u201cShe is someone who gets what we do.\u201dBut Ms. Pritzker\u2019s business-executive background complicated her path to a top post in Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. As finance chairwoman of his 2008 campaign, she served as Mr. Obama\u2019s crucial conduit to her circle of bankers, executives and Jewish leaders and raised $745 million to elect him. Afterward she was a leading contender for the commerce job, only to withdraw from consideration, with her family\u2019s fortune in turmoil because of the financial crisis and the public backlash against Wall Street at a fever pitch.Ms. Pritzker said the decision had been hers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right\u201d to join the administration, she said, while she was trying to run a business in an economic meltdown. But others close to Mr. Obama said his advisers had worried that installing a wealthy finance chairwoman in the cabinet would muddy the president\u2019s image as a transcendent figure who rejected business as usual, and that she would face a confirmation fight on Capitol Hill.Adding to the problems, Ms. Pritzker had been part owner of Superior Bank, which collapsed in 2001, partly because of subprime mortgages, and her family had used offshore trusts to pay less in taxes \u2014 a practice the president had condemned.If Ms. Pritzker was bitter, she never showed it, colleagues say. She took on a heavy workload on behalf of the Obama administration, serving on two economic advisory boards and leading an effort to link community colleges with businesses to improve students\u2019 competitiveness in the job market. She played a substantial, if lesser, role raising money for his second presidential campaign. When Mr. Obama was re-elected, he turned to Ms. Pritzker to take the commerce post.\u201cOf the cabinet, for sure there\u2019s no one who knows him longer, been more involved in Barack Obama\u2019s getting to where he got to, than her,\u201d said William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama who also served as commerce secretary under Bill Clinton. \u201cHer sucking it up when she was disappointed about not getting something in the first term probably enhanced that.\u201dBut union leaders were bitter that the president had selected someone whose family business, they argued, had exploited housekeepers at its hotels. They said the president\u2019s relationship with Ms. Pritzker was a bigger priority for him than his commitment to workers\u2019 rights, and they were wary of her from the start.Labor leaders \u201chad an impression of someone who wouldn\u2019t be able either to sympathize or empathize with workers in America,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, who has collaborated with Ms. Pritzker on programs to improve workers\u2019 skills. But, he added, \u201cWhat they saw was someone who was acutely aware of and committed to ensuring that workers could succeed.\u201dMs. Pritzker, who rises near dawn for an hourlong daily run and competes in triathlons, paved her way into her family\u2019s male-dominated empire at age 16, when she wrote a letter to her grandfather, A.N. Pritzker, for his 80th birthday, asking why he talked only to the boys, and never to her, about business.\u201cI was born in 1896,\u201d she said he replied. \u201cHow am I supposed to know that women are interested in business?\u201d He rewarded her with a weekslong summer crash course in accounting. As an 18-year-old undergraduate at Harvard University, Ms. Pritzker fell in love with her introductory economics class and impressed friends with her work ethic.\u201cWhat she did know was that she wanted to make a way for herself that would enable her to play a leadership role in her family business,\u201d said Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, her Harvard roommate, who is now the deputy secretary of energy. Ms. Pritzker went on to earn simultaneous law and business degrees from Stanford University.For the trip to Cuba, Ms. Pritzker traded in the Gulfstream that she uses as her traveling office for a standard blue-and-white government plane emblazoned with \u201cUnited States of America,\u201d all to make space for a larger-than-usual entourage of aides and to comply with security requirements. In hot and humid Old Havana on Wednesday, she strolled through the cobblestone streets and grand plazas in a sleeveless top and pencil skirt, stopping to peek into the lobby of the Hemingway Hotel and greet Cuban schoolchildren, who sang sweetly of their fealty to Fidel Castro and socialism.On this trip, with the embargo still in place, she was in many ways promoting more promise than policy, a kind of ambassador of aspirations for the power of market forces to help bring change to Cuba.\u201cI hope what I could stand for in their eyes is a businessperson who has enormous sensitivity to the issues of society,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said as her plane prepared to land in Havana this week. \u201cThis is more than just, \u2018Let\u2019s do commerce.\u2019 There\u2019s a personal aspect of this too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia Is the Exception, Not the Model", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORAN, Algeria \u2014 What\u2019s to be done with Islamists? Should they be assimilated into the phony multipartism of closed regimes? Included in processes of political liberalization? Democratized by force \u2014 bombed into democratizing? Killed? For more than two decades, the question has been a torment. First for Arab elites, then for Muslim elites and then, after Sept. 11, 2001, for the whole world.The radical approach \u2014 violence \u2014 doesn\u2019t accomplish much except to further radicalize the radicals. Slaughtering a jihadist only confirms his methods while reinforcing his ideology of victimhood and turning him into a martyr. The West becomes the enemy, and so do its democracy and its rules. By reaction, Islamism becomes the \u201csolution\u201d \u2014 which is, incidentally, the slogan of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Islamism\u2019s vision of the world becomes justified. Its propaganda becomes truth, backed up by photographs showing the dead victims of the West\u2019s Crusades.To kill a jihadist is to turn a bug in a democracy into a clash of civilizations. It is to make him eternal. It is to bless his curses. The policies of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt illustrate how this choice leads to an impasse: Repression serves as validation for more radicalization, encouraging the recruitment of new jihadists and so a repetition of the cycle of confrontation.There is another approach, which is to eliminate the most radical Islamists and assimilate the moderate ones. In Algeria, which was battered during the 1990s by a war between an authoritarian military regime and radical jihadists, the current (and eternal) president calls this \u201cthe politics of reconciliation.\u201d The idea is simple: Drain the pools from which the most violent elements are recruited, while offering the others another way \u2014 with judicial amnesties or by tolerating Islamist political parties that are \u201csoft,\u201d that is, controlled and limited in their actions.The concept is worthy, but its translation into reality is corrupt. \u201cReconciliation\u201d often turns into a deal between a hard-nosed regime and Islamists, and together they immobilize society by obstructing the progressive elites\u2019 demands for democratization. The regime manages any rents stemming from oil resources or a strategic position, and the Islamists manage the street, public space, society and morals. This arrangement tends to turn citizens into believers, into religious persons more concerned with their faith and its practice than with, say, the revival of the economy, judicial independence or free elections. In Algeria, as elsewhere, protest marches against a law authorizing the use of alcohol or against a film deemed immoral are customary, whereas demonstrations against corruption or mismanagement are extremely rare.In the face of Islamists, democracy is often foiled by the cunning of dictatorships. Such was Algeria\u2019s experience in the 1990s, though that remained invisible because the Internet didn\u2019t exist then. This is what is happening today in Egypt, which is trapped in a cycle of confrontation between Islamists and the military, with democrats largely sidelined. When the Egyptian writer Alaa Al-Aswany said of former President Mohamed Morsi that \u201che used democracy like a stepping-stone on the way to installing an Islamist regime,\u201d he captured at once the anxiety of democracy and the pain of dictatorship. The tragic choice offered to progressive elites is to either submit to theocracy or implore the military for protection.It will have taken the case of Tunisia, home of the 2010-2011 protests that inspired other uprisings in many Arab countries, to suggest the possibility of a third way: a consensus, however fragile, between Islamist elites and progressive elites. Rached Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda Movement, the Islamist party that won the 2011 elections after the dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled the country, eventually yielded to pressure \u2014 from unions, from centrists, from nationalists, from progressives \u2014 and in the name of the national interest embraced a policy of dialogue. In an interview with a French newspaper, Mr. Ghannouchi explained why he broke with the hard-line tradition of Islamists in the Muslim world: \u201cWhat good is staying in a house that\u2019s collapsing on top of you?\u201d The admission came just a few months after Mr. Morsi\u2019s overthrow in Egypt.In 2014 Ennahda voluntarily stepped down from power, and in its place emerged a government based on an innovative formula: an elite consensus that trumped the electoral majority. This was heresy in democratic terms, but also a valid way of securing stability and warding off violence. And it is what the Nobel committee apparently wanted to reward by granting its prestigious Peace Prize to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, which had led the initiative.A Tunisian way, an Arab possibility, a global solution? To be considered with caution. For this option to be available a country needs a weak regime, dictatorship defeated, and Islamists who aren\u2019t too radical, or who at least are patient in their ambition for world domination. There are other conditions, too: a strong middle class (to act as neutral broker between opposing partisan currents, with interests of its own to defend); no oil (because oil revenues allow governments to do without taxes and, in the long run, without accountability to their citizens); little foreign funding (dependence can mean cooptation, as with Syria, by Russia and Iran); lack of stark ethnic or sectarian tensions (unlike in Iraq or Yemen); and not too strong an army (unlike in Egypt and Algeria).There are so many caveats that a repeat of the Tunisian example is very unlikely. If the Nobel Peace Prize put a magnifying glass to a question that concerns the whole world \u2014 what is to be done with Islamists? \u2014 it said little about the chances of a generalizable solution. Tunisia is less a model than a unique case.Kamel Daoud, a columnist for Quotidien d\u2019Oran, is the author of \u201cThe Meursault Investigation.\u201d This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grand Canyon Waters, at the Abyss", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEldorado Springs, Colo. \u2014 I RECENTLY reunited with an old friend \u2014 not a person, but a place in Arizona, the state where I was born. It is a timeless place of great antiquity, a shrine of the ages that President Theodore Roosevelt said \u201cman can only mar.\u201dRoosevelt proclaimed the Grand Canyon a national monument in 1908. In so doing, he specifically intended to prevent mining and tourist development from harming one of our nation\u2019s most treasured landscapes. \u201cKeep it for your children, your children\u2019s children and all who come after you,\u201d he said, \u201cas the one great sight which every American should see.\u201dBut mar it we have. An abandoned uranium mine on the canyon\u2019s South Rim has cost taxpayers more than $15 million to remove toxic wastes from the surface. And contaminated water \u2014 flowing underground through the mine\u2019s radioactive ore \u2014 continues to poison a spring-fed creek deep within the canyon. It is a permanent loss at an unconscionable cost that should never be borne again.Roosevelt\u2019s proclamation set aside only a fraction of the Grand Canyon as a national monument. His decision rankled mining and tourist businesses in the booming Arizona territory. Local politicians and profiteers fought the postage-stamp-size monument\u2019s further protection as a national park in 1919.In 1975, Congress nearly doubled the park\u2019s size, declaring that the entire Grand Canyon \u201cincluding tributary side canyons and surrounding plateaus, is a natural feature of national and international significance.\u201d Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, a Republican, introduced the bill. My dad, Congressman Morris Udall, a Democrat from Arizona, helped unite bipartisan support to better protect Arizona\u2019s and America\u2019s most famous natural wonder.The Grand Canyon Enlargement Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford four decades ago, returned more than 100,000 acres of federal land to the Havasupai tribe. It also effectively banned the building of two new dams in the canyon\u2019s upper and lower gorge. But it, too, fell short in protecting the Grand Canyon in its entirety.Today, four uranium mines operate within the watershed that drains directly into Grand Canyon National Park. Arbitrary boundaries and antiquated rules permit these mines to threaten hundreds more life-giving seeps and springs in the desert basins below. Thousands of new mining claims on public lands that surround the canyon were put on hold by a 20-year moratorium imposed in 2012 by Ken Salazar, then the interior secretary. The National Mining Association and the Nuclear Energy Institute are suing in federal court to end the ban.Achieving this hard-won hiatus on new uranium claims took more than five years and one of the broadest coalitions ever aligned to protect the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai, \u201cpeople of blue-green water,\u201d whose sole source of drinking water is at risk, led the way. They were joined then by county supervisors, chambers of commerce, ranchers, hunters, bird-watchers, artists, scientists, Arizona\u2019s governor, game and fish commissioners and business owners. All united to stop uranium mining from permanently polluting the Grand Canyon and undermining the region\u2019s tourism-driven economy.But the 2012 victory to halt new claims was temporary. Our challenge now is to rebuild that coalition and make the ban permanent. There\u2019s no reason to wait. President Obama can protect it now.The bill aims to protect 1.7 million acres of historical tribal homeland, including water sources and sacred sites. It would preserve the Grand Canyon\u2019s rich heritage of \u201cbiological, cultural, recreational, geological, educational and scientific values.\u201d It would make permanent the 20-year ban on new mining clams but would allow hunting, grazing, recreation and all other uses to continue under existing laws.Unfortunately, there\u2019s almost no chance that the legislation will gain approval in today\u2019s gridlocked Congress. But the 1906 Antiquities Act gives the president unilateral authority to set aside federal lands as protected national monuments to stop the looting of archaeological sites and for reasons of \u201chistoric or scientific interest.\u201dEarlier this year, my wife and I were invited to join native leaders on a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. We\u2019ve made many such trips before. But this time, at nearly every spring along the way, we stopped to pray.All water is sacred to those who have learned to live where it is scarce. We must defend the Grand Canyon\u2019s sacred waters from unconscionable loss.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Shrinking Populations, Eastern Europe Resists Accepting Migrants", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the former communist nations of Eastern Europe \u2014 where populations are shrinking even faster and economies are struggling \u2014 the influx of migrants would seem to be a perfect fit.But not if you ask the people here.\u201cNo, I would not say there is a great feeling here that we should attract more immigrants,\u201d said Ivailo Kalfin, Bulgaria\u2019s deputy prime minister for demographic and social policies. \u201cThe feeling is there are too many immigrants, not too few.\u201dSuch is the paradox of the migration crisis for Eastern Europe. Even as the region stares at the most dire demographic implosion on the Continent, it has proved the most resistant to accepting migrants.And while the perceived threat of immigration resonates deeply here, the persistent combination of failing economies and corrupt governments has not made the countries particularly attractive to migrants in any case.In fact, Bulgaria is proving unattractive even to Bulgarians, who, like the migrants, are making their way to more prosperous parts of Europe in droves.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.Yet anti-migrant sentiment runs strong here and elsewhere in a region worried that the wave of people pouring into Europe from the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere will overwhelm their fragile economies and weaken their national cultures.\u201cIt is a rational and pragmatic argument that these countries could make use of migrants,\u201d said Aleksander Smolar, president of the Stefan Batory Foundation in Warsaw, which promotes democracy and civic issues.\u201cBut we need to remember that they, unlike countries in the West, never had to develop big immigration policies,\u201d he explained. \u201cCountries in Eastern and Central Europe have never been countries of immigration, but rather emigration.\u201dThat remains so, especially for countries like Bulgaria that have been accepted into the European Union, allowing citizens to travel more freely.\u201cYou would be hard pressed to meet someone in the region who does not have at least one member of their immediate or extended family living abroad,\u201d said Sarah Garding, a researcher at the University of Oxford who has focused on migration in Eastern Europe. \u201cAnd the smaller your country is, the greater weight each of these departures carries.\u201dThat this population plunge is coming during a massive influx of illegal immigrants is not lost on regional officials.\u201cI would be very happy to accept refugees in my city,\u201d said Robert Biedron, the mayor of Slupsk, a city in northern Poland, and a rare pro-immigration voice in the region. \u201cThe practical reason is that my city is depopulated. I have fewer and fewer citizens, like many medium-sized cities in Poland.\u201dYet officials point out that several factors prevent the migrants from solving the demographic crisis and explain the region\u2019s resistance to welcoming them.For one thing, political leaders argue that it makes no sense to force migrants who wish to live in Germany or other more prosperous nations to settle in the financially hobbled East.They will simply pick up and move to where they wanted to be in the first place, said Robert Fico, Slovakia\u2019s prime minister.At the same time, residents of the Eastern nations have proved unwilling to welcome migrants, especially those of a different faith, to a region whose historical memory includes battles to throw off Muslim occupation.Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, speaks of his country providing a bulwark between Christian Europe and the Islamic world.Finally, as many migrants themselves point out, it is not merely safety and financial prospects that they seek, but life in a more open and tolerant society.So the same forces that are driving thousands of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to Western Europe are pushing the new refugees in the same direction.\u201cI can tell you why people leave,\u201d said Evgenia Peeva, 29, who returned to Bulgaria after graduating from Harvard to start Teach for Bulgaria, an NGO modeled on Teach for America. \u201cPeople in general are just frustrated with the political situation. They cannot rely on the judicial system. Their leaders lack any sort of political vision. They have been waiting since 1989, and they are tired of waiting for this change to happen.\u201dIn 1990, just after the fall of Communism, Bulgaria had about nine million citizens, making it slightly bigger than Sweden and Austria. Today, the official population is 7.2 million, much smaller than Sweden or Austria, and projections are that it will lose 12 percent of its population by 2030 and 28 percent by 2050.Romania is not far behind, expected to lose 22 percent of its population by 2050, followed by Ukraine (down 22 percent), Moldova (20 percent), Bosnia and Herzegovina (19 percent), Latvia (19 percent), Lithuania (17 percent), Serbia (17 percent), Croatia (16 percent) and Hungary (16 percent).Milen Galabov, 39, a graphic designer who transplanted his young family from Sofia to Amsterdam this summer, said it was more than money that moved them. Both he and his wife, a lawyer, earned good salaries, by Sofia standards, and they had a comfortable life.\u201cBut we realized that the new dresses and the new cars are not everything we need,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we will have a chance to live in a normal country with a normal life.\u201dMagdalena Kostova is director of Bulgaria\u2019s Demographic and Social Statistics Directorate. Between the two most recent censuses \u2014 in 2001 and 2011 \u2014 Bulgaria\u2019s population fell by 564,000, she said. About two-thirds was because of the very low birthrate, but the remainder was pure emigration.\u201cThese days, close to 80 percent of the medical class leaves after graduation,\u201d said Ruslan Stefanov, an analyst for the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia. \u201cPeople feel that life is too unpredictable here.\u201dThe absence of so many young people may provide a void that immigrants could fill, but it also provides a warning sign to the migrants that they may need to follow the Bulgarian \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the west to live in the kind of open societies they desire.\u201cBulgaria is my homeland \u2014 I want to live here,\u201d said Stefaniya Boneva, 25, a medical student in Germany, while sitting in an outdoor coffee shop near the center of Sofia. \u201cBut something would have to change very drastically for me to come back here. It is probably just an idealistic dream.\u201dAnd the families left behind \u2014 many of whom remain dependent on money from relatives abroad \u2014 are not terribly eager to trade in their vanished sons and daughters for an unknown community of immigrant strangers.What is needed, Mr. Smolar said, is more calm discussion and less political opportunism over what is clearly an explosive issue in the region.\u201cThe idea of suddenly meeting the \u2018other,\u2019 someone from a different culture, a different religion, a different physical appearance, is for people here quite naturally a cause for fear, maybe even panic,\u201d Mr. Smolar said.\u201cNormally,\u201d he added, \u201csuch a change should be preceded by laborious national discussions that would allow people to get used to the fact that they are going to have ethnic minorities living alongside them.\u201dThe latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.But instead of such national discussions, there has been a wave of political opportunism, he said.\u201cMany cynical politicians prefer to play on people\u2019s fears to their own advantage,\u201d Mr. Smolar said. \u201cUnfortunately, scaremongering does help boost the ratings.\u201dStoyan Dodnikov was 6 when his mother moved to Chalkida, a small city north of Athens, where she cleans houses and sends the bulk of her earnings back home to the small village of Patalenitsa. He is 13 now.He lives with his grandparents in a compound off a dusty square near the village center. \u201cWe are getting by,\u201d said his grandmother, Petrunka Yankova, 52.Sitting in the shade of a grape arbor in his backyard, thick with vegetable plants and alive with the hum of insects, Stoyan outlined his future. Unlike many, he hopes to stay in Bulgaria.\u201cMy plan is to start my own business,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many ideas and I think I can make them work.\u201dFor Bulgaria to prosper, he said, it needs more business innovation. Only then can it become a country where mothers do not need to leave their sons behind to seek work in a distant country.\u201cTo tell the real truth,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is my aim.\u201dBoryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting from Sofia, and Joanna Berendt from Warsaw.Advertisement"}

Mr. Walsh has sought to sell the company\u2019s assets to repair its balance sheet since he succeeded Tom Albanese as chief executive.At the time of Mr. Albanese\u2019s resignation, Rio Tinto took a $14 billion write-down on the aluminum and coal assets that it bought at the height of the commodity boom from 2000 to 2009.Rio Tinto\u2019s net debt as of June 30 was $13.68 billion, an increase of 10 percent from Dec. 31 last year.

{"Headline": "Our Deadened, Carbon-Soaked Seas", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsOcean and coastal waters around the world are beginning to tell a disturbing story. The seas, like a sponge, are absorbing increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so much so that the chemical balance of our oceans and coastal waters is changing and a growing threat to marine ecosystems. Over the past 200 years, the world\u2019s seas have absorbed more than 150 billion metric tons of carbon from human activities. Currently, that\u2019s a worldwide average of 15 pounds per person a week, enough to fill a coal train long enough to encircle the equator 13 times every year.We can\u2019t see this massive amount of carbon dioxide that\u2019s going into the ocean, but it dissolves in seawater as carbonic acid, changing the water\u2019s chemistry at a rate faster than seen for millions of years. Known as ocean acidification, this process makes it difficult for shellfish, corals and other marine organisms to grow, reproduce and build their shells and skeletons.About 10 years ago, ocean acidification nearly collapsed the annual $117 million West Coast shellfish industry, which supports more than 3,000 jobs. Ocean currents pushed acidified water into coastal areas, making it difficult for baby oysters to use their limited energy to build protective shells. In effect, the crop was nearly destroyed.Human health, too, is a major concern. In the laboratory, many harmful algal species produce more toxins and bloom faster in acidified waters. A similar response in the wild could harm people eating contaminated shellfish and sicken, even kill, fish and marine mammals such as sea lions.Increasing acidity is hitting our waters along with other stressors. The ocean is warming; in many places the oxygen critical to marine life is decreasing; pollution from plastics and other materials is pervasive; and in general we overexploit the resources of the ocean. Each stressor is a problem, but all of them affecting the oceans at one time is cause for great concern. For both the developing and developed world, the implications for food security, economies at all levels, and vital goods and services are immense.This year, the first nationwide study showing the vulnerability of the $1 billion U.S. shellfish industry to ocean acidification revealed a considerable list of at-risk areas. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, these areas include Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and areas off Maine and Massachusetts. Already at risk are Alaska\u2019s fisheries, which account for nearly 60 percent of the United States commercial fish catch and support more than 100,000 jobs.Ocean acidification is weakening coral structures in the Caribbean and in cold-water coral reefs found in the deep waters off Scotland and Norway. In the past three decades, the number of living corals covering the Great Barrier Reef has been cut in half, reducing critical habitat for fish and the resilience of the entire reef system. Dramatic change is also apparent in the Arctic, where the frigid waters can hold so much carbon dioxide that nearby shelled creatures can dissolve in the corrosive conditions, affecting food sources for indigenous people, fish, birds and marine mammals. Clear pictures of the magnitude of changes in such remote ocean regions are sparse. To better understand these and other hotspots, more regions must be studied.We cannot yet predict exactly how ocean acidification will affect connections among the world\u2019s many different marine organisms, but we do know the consequences will be profound. Research already points to the unnatural behavior of coral clownfish in an acidified environment. These fish wander farther from their natural protection, making them more vulnerable to predators. We have yet to learn how salmon and other commercially important fish will adapt as acidification erodes their food supply, especially since some of the most vulnerable species are the small, simple life forms that juvenile salmon and other fish depend on. There may be cascading impacts that we don\u2019t yet fully understand. Acidification won\u2019t make seawater dangerous for swimming, but it will upset the balance among the multitudes of microscopic life found in every drop of seawater. Such changes will almost certainly affect seafood supplies and the ocean\u2019s ability to store pollutants, including future carbon emissions.To understand where the challenges lie, we need better ocean-measuring capability, linked with improved modeling of marine ecological systems. Smart investments in monitoring and observing are critical to building resilience and hedging risks that can directly affect economies at all levels. There is urgency to such investments. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducts round-the-clock monitoring of global CO2. The rate of increase has never been higher than during the past three years, accelerating the ocean acidification process.Both the United States and Britain recognize that rising CO2 and the production of other greenhouse gases have widespread consequences and have called for strong action to reduce carbon emissions. We are pleased that representatives of our two nations help lead the pioneering Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, a collaboration of scientists from 30 countries. This network is based on the premise that we can\u2019t manage what we don\u2019t measure. It\u2019s designed to provide the basis for robust forecasting by integrating existing observations from unmanned vehicles, research vessels, volunteer observing ships and many more assets.The new network will build on the success of the American and British teams that recently came in first and second in the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE by developing affordable, accurate sensor technology. Such technology will help coastal countries around the world obtain the environmental information required to underpin sound policy and build community and global resilience. Already oyster hatcheries on the U.S. West Coast are working with scientists to monitor water quality and adapt to ocean acidification so baby oysters can survive. And while ocean acidification is a global concern, inroads are occurring at the local scale, encouraging control, for example, of nutrient pollution that can exacerbate acidification.When it comes to the health of the sea, we are all stakeholders. The ocean is a harbinger of our own well-being and the resilience and economic viability of our planet. We ignore the risks of ocean acidification at our own peril, and that of future generations.Richard W. Spinrad is the chief scientist of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Ian Boyd is the chief scientific adviser to the British government\u2019s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Lawmakers Clear Way for $2.3 Billion in Bailout Funds", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek lawmakers, despite heated debate, approved a package of economic changes and austerity measures early Saturday, taking a step toward unlocking the first slice of loan money from the country\u2019s nearly $98 billion international bailout program.The legislation covers some of the economic changes sought by the country\u2019s international creditors, which include raising the retirement age, cutting pensions, liberalizing the energy market, opening up cosseted professions, expanding a property tax that Greeks already revile, and pushing forward a stalled program to privatize state assets.Passing the package paves the way for Greece to receive the first 2 billion euros, or about $2.3 billion, from the bailout program.It is only the first in a series of changes and austerity measures the Greek Parliament will be asked to approve in coming months to meet benchmarks set by Greece\u2019s international creditors, who plan to dispense money in allotments as the country hits those targets.The several days of parliamentary debate on the measures were frequently tense, with the retirement changes and property tax among the provisions drawing fire from lawmakers, who said they would only increase the country\u2019s austerity burden.\u201cOur only concern is to protect the working classes,\u201d Mr. Tsipras told Parliament on Friday before the vote. \u201cWe will keep our promises.\u201dIn a speech to Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, indicated that things could have been worse. The bill includes \u201c12 to 15 measures whose approval is necessary to unlock the \u20ac2 billion,\u201d he said. There were nearly three dozen demands by the creditors that could have been included this time but were deferred for later.As much as it needs the first dollop of loan money, Greece is also eager for the debt relief that the country\u2019s creditors have promised to consider. That consideration is supposed to follow the creditors\u2019 next review in the coming weeks of Greece\u2019s progress in carrying out changes deemed crucial to getting its battered economy back on track.Before talks on debt can begin, an even tougher challenge looms. In the coming weeks, Greek lawmakers must endorse a second set of measures, including highly contentious plans to increase taxes for farmers and a broader overhaul of the Greek pension system, in exchange for an additional \u20ac1 billion, or about $1.13 billion, in loans. Farmers have already staged protests.The first set of measures was controversial enough. Demonstrations have played out on the streets, and labor unions rallied Friday night outside Parliament, protesting measures they warn will \u201ccrush\u201d Greeks after five years of austerity that have slashed living standards and pushed unemployment above 25 percent.The most controversial changes are those affecting retirees. The bill approved early Saturday foresees the phasing out of early retirement for civil servants by 2022, so that all Greeks retire at 67, and introduces financial penalties for those who retire before the age of 67. Until now, civil servants have been able to retire much earlier. Military officers, for example, can stop working at 58.Another disputed measure, which had foreseen an increase on the tax paid on rental income by Greek property owners, was hastily withdrawn ahead of the vote after an outcry from the political opposition and the association representing Greek property owners, many of whom are struggling to rent out their properties in a persisting recession. A provision that would have obliged property owners to pay tax even on rental income they have not collected was regarded as particularly outrageous.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The tax measures are expected to eventually be put to a vote, though.Just hours before the vote, government officials were scrambling to identify measures that would replace plans for a 23 percent sales tax on private schools, which Mr. Tsipras had promised to suspend in response to a public outcry.But a despised property tax, introduced four years ago as an emergency measure, has been broadened to include most buildings and surrounding plots of land.Government officials conceded that many of the changes were tough. They pledged to introduce new measures as soon as possible to offset the austerity.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s political rivals responded in scathing tones. The main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, compared the government\u2019s efforts to those of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure eternally condemned to push a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll down again, over and over. Notably, many of the measures in the new bill had been promised to creditors by the previous New Democracy-led coalition but were never enforced.Mr. Tsipras, originally elected in January on a promise to fight austerity, later backtracked and signed a compromise with Greece\u2019s creditors in July after months of torturous talks. His about-face led to a rebellion that split his leftist Syriza party and triggered general elections that Mr. Tsipras won after promising to implement Greece\u2019s third bailout while seeking to soften the impact of its harsher aspects.According to a draft budget introduced this month, Greece\u2019s debt will exceed 180 percent of gross domestic product this year and rise above 190 percent of G.D.P. in 2016. Only Japan, which is able to finance its debt, has a higher ratio.A projected Greek recession of 2.3 percent this year is expected to ease only slightly next year, when the economy is forecast to contract by 1.3 percent.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a recurring metaphor that peaks at times of torrid technological change and angst about where technology is taking us.A vision of robots threatening jobs and perhaps humanity itself is fueling dire warnings of future trouble \u2014 \u201csummoning the demon,\u201d in the evocative phrase of the technologist-entrepreneur Elon Musk.Yet the current obsession puts the mechanized cart before the algorithmic horse, steering attention away from the here-and-now promise and peril of A.I.Artificial intelligence is already all around us, but it\u2019s mostly software. Google search and ad targeting, movie and product recommendations on Netflix and Amazon, Apple\u2019s Siri digital assistant and IBM\u2019s Watson question-answering system are all animated by artificial intelligence. Fed by vast amounts of digital data from sources like the web, sensors, smartphones and genomics, the software actually learns, in its way. The more raw data that is ingested, the smarter the artificial intelligence becomes.The physical world where robots exist, meanwhile, is multidimensional and messy. So it is in the digital realm where the machine-learning algorithms of artificial intelligence have made their greatest strides \u2014 in tasks like facial recognition, language translation, prediction and decision making.\u201cA lot of the problems are easier in software, so a lot of the action is around intelligent software \u2014 softbots rather than robots,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist and executive director of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle.An interesting reality check took place in June, when two dozen teams of leading robotics engineers gathered in Pomona, Calif., for a competition sponsored by the Pentagon\u2019s research agency. Their robots had to navigate mocked-up hazardous environments, like a contaminated nuclear plant, and do simple tasks \u2014 walk up steps, turn a valve, operate a power drill. The chores would take a human five minutes, or 10 at most. The winning robot took 45 minutes.Most struggled badly, falling down steps and taking long pauses to figure things out, even with remote control assistance. Turning a knob to open a door proved daunting for many. One young man in the audience observed, \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the Terminator, just keep your door closed.\u201dRobots will surely get better. Google\u2019s self-driving cars, for example, are impressive, but in heavy rain or snow, a human had better take the wheel. And robots with more limited ambitions are already taking over backbreaking work on factory floors and assisting surgeons for greater precision and control in operating rooms.But the greatest progress has been in software, which is rapidly moving into the mainstream of the economy. So far, the largest commercial use of learning software has been in marketing, where it improves the odds of making a sale \u2014 tailored marketing, targeted advertising and personalized product recommendations.Big companies and start-ups are beginning to use learning software in higher-stakes decisions like medical diagnosis, crime prevention, hiring selections and loan approvals.The idea is that an A.I. turbocharger can be applied to all kinds of decisions, making them smarter, fairer and less prone to human whim and bias. The goal could be saving money or saving lives.Still, even enthusiasts have qualms.Take consumer lending, a market where several start-ups are using big data and algorithms to assess the credit risk of borrowers. It\u2019s a digital-age twist on the most basic tenet of banking: Know your customer. By harvesting data from many sources, including social network connections, even observing how an applicant fills out online forms, lenders say algorithms can more accurately predict whether a candidate will repay than by simply looking at a person\u2019s credit history.The promise is more efficient loan underwriting and pricing, saving consumers billions of dollars. But the new A.I. lending essentially amounts to a digital black box that pores over mountains of data. \u201cA decision is made about you, and you have no idea why it was done,\u201d said Rajeev Date, a former deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cThat is disquieting.\u201dDr. Herbert Chase, a professor at Columbia\u2019s College of Physicians and Surgeons, was asked as an unpaid researcher to try out IBM\u2019s Watson software when the company\u2019s scientists were adapting the technology for medicine. To try to stump Watson, Dr. Chase recalled a case decades earlier, when he made a correct diagnosis of adult rickets for a young woman, but only after extensive tests and months of being baffled. He fed Watson a few symptoms and the program, which ranks diagnoses by probability, swiftly replied and ranked adult rickets second.Not perfect, but Dr. Chase was impressed that the technology was so close and so fast. He thinks Watson-like software, which can scan and mine many thousands of medical articles in a few seconds, will be part of the future of medicine, assisting doctors inundated with information and short of time. But his nagging concern is that over time \u201cwe come to trust the technology too much, that it becomes the medical equivalent of blindly following a GPS system on your car down a dead end,\u201d Dr. Chase said.This, of course, is a central issue as these intelligent systems \u2014 whether software programs or robots \u2014 evolve. Will they be servants or masters?\u201cEven if these systems are consistently right, slavishly following their instructions robs us of our ability to decide on our own,\u201d said Kristian Hammond, an artificial intelligence expert at Northwestern University. \u201cThen you actually get the world no one wants. The machine algorithm tells us what to do.\u201dThe antidote is what Mr. Hammond calls \u201ctransparency\u201d and others call \u201cstorytelling\u201d \u2014 an explanation of the data ingredients that go into an automated decision and how it is made. University scientists and corporate researchers are working on A.I.-monitoring technology that ranges from data audit trails to English-language accounts of an algorithm\u2019s chain of reasoning.But for the near term, it\u2019s those unseen algorithms \u2014 far more than robots \u2014 that deserve a watchful human eye. The stakes, some experts say, extend far beyond mere technology. \u201cWe need to make sure that the data and algorithms are continuously reviewed and vetted by a broad class of people,\u201d said Alex Pentland, a computational social scientist at the M.I.T. Media Lab. \u201cThink of representative democracy, forging algorithms rather than laws.\u201dSteve Lohr is a technology reporter for The New York Times and the author of \u201cData-ism.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the European Privacy Ruling That\u2019s Confounding Silicon Valley", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, when Max Schrems won a landmark privacy case in the European Court of Justice, Edward J. Snowden told him on Twitter that he had \u201cchanged the world for the better.\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, had a different opinion, saying the decision \u201cputs at risk the thriving trans-Atlantic digital economy.\u201d The brouhaha, however, had little evident effect on the apparently imperturbable Mr. Schrems.\u201cI expected this,\u201d said Mr. Schrems, a 28-year-old graduate student in law at the University of Vienna who, for the formal reading of the decision, wore jeans and an untucked button-down shirt. \u201cUnder the law they couldn\u2019t say anything else.\u201dFor all of Mr. Schrems\u2019s certainty, few privacy lawyers expected such a sweeping decision. The case concerned the transfer of the personal data between Europe and the United States, a complex, previously obscure issue that nonetheless has significant consequences for most companies that send personal information \u2014 via activities like searches, social media postings and online purchases \u2014 across the Atlantic.The decision invalidated the so-called safe harbor agreement under which more than 4,000 American companies, including Google and Facebook, were handling the personal data of European consumers. Those companies can find other ways to transfer this information legally, but the court\u2019s decision seems to empower the national regulators in each of the 28 European Union countries to investigate whether data transferred to the United States is protected adequately. And some of those regulators have a dim view of Silicon Valley\u2019s attitude toward privacy.Mr. Schrems\u2019s legal campaign against Facebook began when he was a 24-year-old student studying at the Santa Clara University School of Law in California. Over the course of the semester, a couple of lawyers from Silicon Valley technology companies came to speak to his privacy class, and Mr. Schrems was taken aback to hear them say they didn\u2019t take Europe\u2019s strict privacy laws very seriously, since companies rarely faced significant penalties for breaking them.At the time, Mr. Schrems was looking for a topic for a paper. \u201cI had to write about something,\u201d he said recently. So he decided to look at how Facebook deals with European data protection laws. Those laws limit how companies collect personal information, prohibit them from using it for unauthorized purposes without permission and restrict how they handle it.Mr. Schrems sent Facebook a formal request to see all of the data the company had collected about him, which he has the right to do under European law. After a couple of weeks and about a dozen emails, he received a CD by mail with more than 1,200 pages of information \u2014 every \u201cpoke,\u201d friend request and invitation (and response) he had sent since setting up an account in 2008. Most of it was no surprise, but he was shocked to see that Facebook had retained information he had deleted \u2014 and was no longer visible online \u2014 including the complete text of a private chat with a friend who had been hospitalized for psychological problems. (Facebook has said an individual can delete only his side of a correspondence.) \u201cHer health history is in these messages,\u201d Mr. Schrems said, \u201cand I deleted them, but they were still there.\u201dMr. Schrems doesn\u2019t object to Facebook, and he still uses his account. \u201cWe should be able to use all of these services,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there has to be a line.\u201d So he filed 22 complaints about data retention and some of the company\u2019s other privacy practices with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook, because its European operations are based in Ireland. Two years later, after Mr. Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency could gain access to the personal information of Europeans held by American technology companies through the Prism program, Mr. Schrems filed another complaint, asserting that Facebook couldn\u2019t transfer his personal information to the United States, since it wasn\u2019t adequately protected there. The regulator rejected this petition.This eventually became the European Court of Justice case decided last week. The court ruled that national regulators can investigate whether data transfers comply with European law, but also, crucially, that the safe harbor agreement was itself invalid. (Facebook issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the case was about United States surveillance and that \u201cFacebook has done nothing wrong.\u201d) The ruling is also expected to complicate negotiations for a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreement, as well as new European data-protection legislation.American technology firms are especially worried because they routinely transfer so much information across the Atlantic. \u201cInternational data transfers are the lifeblood of the digital economy,\u201d said Townsend Feehan, chief executive of IAB Europe, which represents online advertising companies including Google as well as small start-ups. The ruling \u201cbrings with it significant uncertainty as to the future possibility for such transfers.\u201dAs Mr. Schrems sees it, however, what is at stake is a deeper conflict between the European legal view of privacy as a right equivalent to free speech and that of the United States, where consumers are asked to read and agree to a company\u2019s terms of service and decide what\u2019s best for themselves. \u201cWe only do this in the privacy field \u2014 dump all the responsibility on the user,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. He pointed out that consumers are not expected to make decisions about other complex issues, like food or building safety. \u201cIn a civilized society,\u201d he said, \u201cyou expect that if you walk into a building it\u2019s not going to collapse on your head.\u201dHowever much people want to hold on to their privacy, they nonetheless inadvertently reveal all sorts of things when they go online, including habits, sexual orientation and political beliefs. Data gathered online is sometimes sold, shared or combined with information from mobile phones or offline sources. All of this information is a vital raw material for a digital advertising business expected to be worth more than $80 billion worldwide by 2018.\u201cSurveillance,\u201d wrote Bruce Schneier, a leading computer security analyst, \u201cis the business model of the Internet.\u201d Big Brother is no longer the only threat to privacy, and Europe has struggled to regulate the gossipy circle of consumer-data-collecting companies. Facebook currently faces challenges from five European regulators, including a Dutch-led investigation into how the company uses data from services like Instagram and WhatsApp and a Belgian effort to stop it from tracking consumers who have not joined the service.Mr. Schrems, lawmakers and various regulators are essentially asking why consumers don\u2019t have more control over the information gathered by their computers and phones \u2014 and perhaps soon by their smartwatches and self-driving cars. \u201cThis is something we see as a fundamental value,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. To drive home the analogy for an American, he put it this way: \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t feel like applying the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201dMr. Schrems first became interested in privacy when he spent a year as an exchange student in Avon Park, a town in central Florida. It was quite a shock for a 16-year-old from cosmopolitan Salzburg, Austria\u2019s fourth-largest city. \u201cEveryone was deeply religious, everyone was Republican,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. He remembers being surprised at the level of security in his high school, which had video cameras mounted in the hallway.Like many young, well-educated Europeans, Mr. Schrems likes the United States, but he objects to the tendency of Silicon Valley companies to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. \u201cThe approach of the big companies is saying we\u2019re above the law,\u201d he said. Not for nothing does he call his organization \u2014 which consists mostly of him and some university friends \u2014 Europe-v-Facebook.One reason European countries take privacy so seriously is that it\u2019s technically considered two rights. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to \u201crespect for private and family life\u201d and also, separately, that \u201ceveryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\u201d It also says that data protection laws must be overseen by independent regulators, which is why national data protection authorities in Europe have so much power.\u201cData protection is a right to determine how \u2014 rather than whether \u2014 one participates in sharing information,\u201d says Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute who writes on these issues. That distinction is important: Data protection doesn\u2019t just protect information individuals don\u2019t want to share; it also gives them some control over information that companies have already gathered. Like every right, it has limits. But \u201cit\u2019s intended to give individuals control over every phase and stage of the use of their personal information,\u201d he said.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.To American lawyers, \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d can sound more like literary theory than law. And even some Europeans see data protection laws as based on confusing logic and overseen by old-fashioned bureaucracies that can complicate everyday tasks without offering an effective way to stop truly bad actors.To Mr. Schrems, the debate in the United States that arose out of the Snowden leaks was centered on the question of security \u2014 keeping information out of the hands of others. In technology circles, that discussion often revolves around encryption and other technical solutions that put the onus on individuals to protect themselves, a popular idea in libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley that doesn\u2019t play as well in Europe.\u201cEncryption is based to some extent on the idea that the law won\u2019t protect your rights, so you have to protect yourself,\u201d says Karl-Nikolaus Peifer, director of the Institute for Media Law and Communications Law of the University of Cologne. \u201cThe European tradition is that the law will protect you.\u201dTwo days after I met Mr. Schrems in Vienna, I watched him give a short speech at an International Bar Association conference at the Savoy Hotel in London.The Irish Data Protection Commissioner never responded to Mr. Schrems\u2019s original 22 complaints to his satisfaction, so in 2014 he filed a class-action-style case in Austria that was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons. Mr. Schrems appealed. Perhaps most important, however, Mr. Schrems\u2019s original complaints helped inspire the forthcoming European Union data protection legislation. \u201cHe was actually the trigger for me to understand that we couldn\u2019t continue the way the law was applied,\u201d said Viviane Reding, the former European Union justice commissioner who proposed the law and is now a member of the European Parliament.The current version of the legislation calls for a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d system in which American companies would be regulated primarily by the data protection authority of the country in which their European headquarters were in. But the court\u2019s decision could make that untenable.Silicon Valley companies have said they are continuing to transfer data by other legal means, and negotiations on a new safe harbor agreement are continuing. But the court\u2019s decision will make that difficult, and it seems to open the door for national regulators to investigate any of those transfers, which could cause significant headaches for technology companies. Final decisions, made by the European Court of Justice, would be based on corporate behavior, including, potentially, whether companies were cooperating with the N.S.A. American technology companies could also move some operations to Europe, thus avoiding the need to transfer data across the Atlantic.\u201cThere\u2019s a massive tension between the libertarian values of Silicon Valley, which is focused on innovation, and the 28 national regulators focused on the rules and regulations of privacy as a human right,\u201d said J. Trevor Hughes, chief executive of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, which has taken no position on the case. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching for what the regulators do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Q. and A. With Fed\u2019s Eric Rosengren: Still Bullish on Economy", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary Policy\u201cUp to now, I thought the incoming data was consistent with a reasonably strong U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said in an interview Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see if the data continues to ratify my idea that the economy is reasonably strong or whether there\u2019s a sign of broader weakness than I was expecting to see.\u201dMr. Rosengren acknowledged that the Fed was unlikely to raise rates at its next meeting, in late October, but said he continued to view an increase in the near future as the most likely and appropriate outcome.The text of our conversation is lightly edited for clarity.It\u2019s one report. I think we\u2019re going to have to put it together and see if this is the beginning of more weak data or whether this ends up being a little bit on the anomalous side. If the economy is continuing to grow faster than 2 percent, then we would expect that over time we\u2019ll see further improvement in labor markets and this will seem anomalous, in which case it would be appropriate to be tightening. On the other hand, if we start getting a string of weak data, then obviously we don\u2019t need to be tightening if the economy is slowing down.I don\u2019t think one data report one way or the other would shift either the timing or what I thought was appropriate. It\u2019s too soon to tell. Fortunately we\u2019re not voting today, so we\u2019ll have a little bit of time to think about how the incoming data comes in.I think a second disconnect may be if you want to tighten a little bit earlier and make sure you can do it gradually vs. being willing to wait longer and then possibly having to tighten more abruptly. The risk of waiting longer and having to tighten abruptly is, if you look at the history of mistakes, sometimes we overshoot and then overshooting can slow down the economy much more than we want it to. So my own personal preference would be that we actually have a fairly gradual increase in interest rates and that we don\u2019t wait so long that we end up getting behind the curve and we end up having to tighten more abruptly.And then another area is, how do you weight financial stability concerns? So when unemployment is very high and inflation is very low, maybe you don\u2019t put much weight on the financial stability concerns. But as labor markets and inflationary pressures seem like they may be a little more imminent, it makes more sense to think about the potential cost of keeping interest rates close to zero for a very long time. I think all of those factors can lead people to come to different conclusions with roughly the same data and roughly the same models.In most models that we use, you don\u2019t get market overreactions to Federal Reserve actions. But the reality is we know that we can affect short-term rates, but [we don\u2019t know] how the markets decide to process that and how much long rates and interest rate spreads move. We can look at historical relationships, but I don\u2019t think we have a large degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to capture that. That\u2019s somewhat hard to pick up in some of the academic models that we frequently utilize. Particularly after being at the zero lower bound for a long time, I think moving in large discrete amounts would be a risky strategy.Too much reliance on any one set of tools is probably a little bit worrisome given the lack of confidence we have in any one set of tools, and there is a limited number of macroprudential tools that we currently have. That does mean that monetary policy may have to play a larger role than if we had a broader set of macroprudential tools to deal with buildups in particular sectors.Like anything else, there are trade-offs and fortunately Europe is trying the tool. And we\u2019ll get to see whether the tool seems to be effective and see what their experience is. Some of the institutional features would be a bit different here, but we\u2019ll have an opportunity to look and see how successful it is in other countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Risks, Cuomo Bets on Solar Power to Lift Buffalo", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has committed up to $750 million to the project, the biggest economic development effort he has undertaken in his five years as governor.In doing so, he has not just bet big on solar energy, a competitive and rapidly growing business, but also on the success of SolarCity, a fast-growing California company that will operate out of the factory that the New York State will own.The potential benefits seem substantial: The state has said the 1.2 million-square-foot SolarCity factory, which is scheduled to open in early 2016, will create 5,000 jobs, with 3,000 of them in western New York.\u201cThe ultimate goal is to get these upstate economies, including Buffalo, off their backs and onto their feet and the real measure of success is private-sector job creation and investment, and I think you are seeing that,\u201d said Howard Zemsky, chief executive of Empire State Development, the government\u2019s economic development agency.The project is not without risk, some of it associated with SolarCity. Its chairman is the entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also leads Tesla, the electric car company. And it could take years to assess whether the project was worthy of the praise heaped on it in 2013, when the project was announced.\u201cThis is like the Yankees coming to Buffalo,\u201d said Alain E. Kaloyeros, president of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, an adviser to Governor Cuomo who has been involved in the Buffalo project. \u201cThis is like the Buffalo Bills winning the Super Bowl.\u201dAmong the issues raised by investors is a federal tax credit for solar that has benefited SolarCity; the tax credit is scheduled to decrease to 10 percent from 30 percent for commercial customers in 2017 and be eliminated for homeowners.\u201cThis is speculative stuff,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative research group. \u201cThis is not like opening the checkbook for Mercedes-Benz, a known entity with a known and tested product.\u201dWhile it is not known if SolarCity is a focus of the investigation, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Lyndon Rive, said in an interview that his company had not been subpoenaed and does not believe it was a target.New York did not set out to bet big on solar panels or SolarCity.Buffalo has been the centerpiece of the governor\u2019s plan to revitalize the upstate economy. In his first term, Mr. Cuomo pledged $1 billion to try to help the city, an investment the administration has said would eventually create 14,000 jobs.In November 2013, the Cuomo administration announced it planned to invest $225 million there to build a facility for high-tech and green-energy businesses. Two tenants were identified: Soraa, a California-based manufacturer of LED lighting; and Silevo, which makes solar panels.In June 2014, SolarCity announced it was buying Silevo. Despite the lucrative tax credit attached to the deal, Mr. Rive, who is Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin, said in an interview that the deal Silevo had in place with New York did not play a role in his decision to buy the company. \u201cThe primary economic value of the company was all on the technology,\u201d he said.Then, three months after SolarCity bought Silevo, Mr. Cuomo said the state was expanding its initial $225 million investment in the Buffalo project to $750 million. SolarCity, it was announced, would be the facility\u2019s lone tenant. Soraa is currently in talks with the state to find space elsewhere, according to a company spokesman.Mr. Zemsky, the chief executive of the development corporation, said the size of the investment grew dramatically because SolarCity was such a dominant player. \u201cThat increased the stability of the bet on solar by a lot and increased the size,\u201d he said.Solar stocks have fallen sharply recently, hurt in part by low gas prices. Still, over the long run, solar stocks have generally done well, fueled by consumer interest in the growing industry. In August, Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on SolarCity to \u201coverweight,\u201d the equivalent of a buy rating, and in a research report noted that the company was the industry\u2019s \u201cpre-eminent residential leasing company\u201d with a \u201chighly creditworthy customer base.\u201dSolarCity customers tend to lease their systems, and pay the company a monthly fee. Mr. Chanos, the trader who has made a financial bet that the stock will fall, says it is a problematic business strategy.\u201cYou basically lease the panels from SolarCity, they put them on your house and they collect the lease payments,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.\u201cSo in effect, if you put on the panels, you have a second mortgage on your home because you hope it is an asset, but in many cases it turns into a liability,\u201d he added, because prices in the relatively new sector would drop.Mr. Chanos would not disclose the size of his investment.Mr. Rive said Mr. Chanos was misinformed. Customers who lease solar panels ultimately save money on utilities, he said. \u201cThere is no lien on the house. We save customers money,\u201d he said.Because SolarCity owns the panels, it benefits from a generous 30 percent federal-investment tax credit for solar power, which will be significantly reduced or go away altogether in 2017. Mr. Rive acknowledged that if the tax credit were not extended, there could be \u201cmassive, massive devastation that occurs in the industry.\u201d However, he said, SolarCity was preparing for the tax credit\u2019s elimination, and the company now had the lowest cost structure in the country. As a result, he said it would \u201cthrive\u201d regardless of what happened.The Solar City project has emerged as a high-profile test of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s economic strategy, one that relies heavily on using state money to lure companies to New York. Since taking office, the governor has offered incentives to numerous corporations to operate in New York.\u201cIf you don\u2019t offer government incentives to a business this big,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said of 1366 Technologies, \u201cbasically you are not even in the game.\u201dBut watchdog groups warn that New York often bets on the fortunes of companies with little or no track record. And when the state subsidies end, the companies themselves may pull up stakes.\u201cNew York has a huge history of putting enormous amounts of money into a small basket,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.Mr. McMahon, of the Empire Center for Public Policy, added that New Yorkers are paying a high price for the jobs these subsidies attract. \u201cWe are essentially paying people to do things here,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Zemsky is confident the state\u2019s investment on solar power will pay big dividends, even if the industry itself stumbles. \u201cIf the solar industry were to go through hard times,\u201d he said, \u201cand if there were to be consolidation, I think that typically benefits the larger players.\u201dAn article on Oct. 26 about the construction of a factory in Buffalo for SolarCity misidentified the company\u2019s chief executive.

{"Headline": "Oregon\u2019s Gun Debate Goes Beyond Liberals vs. Conservatives", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspects for ChangeIt was the state\u2019s first major gun-control law in over a decade, and for Ms. Brown, Oregon\u2019s former secretary of state, who took office in February during a political scandal, it was also a firm statement of the new direction she wanted the state to take.The Douglas County sheriff, John Hanlin, now leading the team investigating the shootings on Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, was one of the bill\u2019s main opponents.\u201cThis law is not going to protect citizens of Oregon in that it is going to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,\u201d Sheriff Hamlin told the State Legislature in testifying against the bill. And, he added, poor counties like his would not have the means to enforce it.\u201cOur budget is continuously shrinking to the point that there are times when we have a difficult time simply responding to domestic disturbances, vehicle crashes, the ordinary calls for service that happen every day,\u201d he said in his videotaped testimony. \u201cTo expect local law enforcement to run down and do an investigation into whether or not an individual, a private individual, has conducted a background check is nearly impossible.\u201dThe divide between the governor and the sheriff shows how questions of gun rights and restrictions reflect not just divisions between conservatives and liberals, or between high-crime and low-crime areas, but also between rich communities and poor ones.In Oregon, the divide between urban places, which are booming, especially the state\u2019s largest city, Portland, and rural ones, which are largely struggling, has often shaped the debate over guns and other social issues. And the clash has intensified as inequality has grown, with cities becoming hubs of technology, as well as population growth, giving them increased clout in the Legislature, while places like Douglas County have been starved for resources and population as old extraction industries like timber have stumbled.\u201cThere is absolutely no question that there is a rural-urban divide in Oregon,\u201d Ms. Brown, a Democrat from Portland, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cI think that is part of a conversation about how we create safer communities in the future.\u201dPart of the dynamic of the gun law question in Oregon \u2014 and the gun debate nationally \u2014 has been the role of national groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, the organization funded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor.It went into effect in August.Even with the new law, the main contours of who can and cannot buy a gun in Oregon mirror those of most other states in the nation, where the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment protects individuals\u2019 right to bear arms. No license is required simply to purchase a handgun or a long gun, though when going to their local gun shops to buy firearms people must pass background checks conducted by the State Police that bar people who have felony convictions, have been involuntarily committed to a mental health institution, or fall into certain other prohibited categories.When it comes to a license to carry a concealed handgun, Oregon is what is considered a \u201cshall issue\u201d state, which means that for the most part, local authorities have little discretion to deny someone such a permit.Sheriffs do have the right under the law to deny someone a permit if there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe the person is a danger to himself or others as a result of his mental state or \u201cpast pattern of behavior involving unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence.\u201dThe gunman in Roseburg, identified as Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, did not appear to have warranted a denial. Federal officials said all 13 of his guns, including six found at the scene, were legally obtained by him and his relatives.This partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting.States in recent years have gone both ways, with the number of legislatures toughening gun laws about equal to the number weakening them, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group based in San Francisco, in an analysis last year. But that group and others like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence also said that some new control measures, notably Oregon\u2019s this year, are tougher and more far-reaching than the laws making gun ownership easier.In Oregon, the background check measure was led mostly by Democrats from Portland, who largely control the Legislature, and some rural lawmakers cited a cultural divide in voting no. In many parts of the state, Portland is seen as alien, a place that does not understand the real Oregon.At a news conference on Friday, for example, Sheriff Hanlin was asked whether it was normal for one person to own so many guns.\u201cIn Oregon?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a hunting state. Firearms are popular in most households.\u201dSheriff Hanlin has been an especially vocal critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Mr. Hanlin posted a letter to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on his department\u2019s Facebook page, arguing that efforts to restrict gun ownership \u201cwould be an indisputable insult to the American people.\u201dThat post was removed Friday after it attracted criticism.But in the region where he works, gun rights are often fiercely defended.Private gun ownership for protection, and in some cases armed citizen patrols in depressed areas of Oregon where cuts in law enforcement budgets have been particularly severe, have added another wrinkle to the debate.A few years ago, after burglaries rose about 70 percent as law enforcement budgets were battered in Josephine County, another timber-economy community just south of Roseburg, patrol groups took up where the police had left off. Their guns, the patrollers said, were helping keep the community safe.Governor Brown, however, said gun attacks were not limited to any demographic or ZIP code.\u201cThey have occurred in rural Oregon and urban Oregon, and we need to figure out a way,\u201d Ms. Brown said. As for answers, she added, the details and ideas will come later. For now, she said, residents in Roseburg and Oregonians generally are still in grief and shock.But safety is paramount and should cut through the usual divides, Ms. Brown said. Oregon and other states, she said, need to figure out \u201chow we can come together around this tragedy and future tragedies and figure out a way to build healthier communities where our children, whether they\u2019re in community college or in kindergarten, feel safe going to school \u2014 and where conflict is resolved through much more peaceful means.\u201dMichael Luo and Robert Mackey contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Southeast Asia, Choking on Haze, Struggles for a Solution", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Savir Singh\u2019s taxi rolled into downtown Singapore, taking an overpass that provides a stunning view of the popular hotels and tourist attractions around Marina Bay.The only problem was that he could barely see them. Thick haze from forest fires set in neighboring Indonesia to clear land for agriculture has blanketed this island state for weeks, and has spread to Malaysia and southern Thailand.While many Singaporeans have sought refuge from the pollution in their homes, offices or shopping malls, Mr. Singh\u2019s only haven is his mobile workplace, and a small bottle of eyedrops lying near his armrest.\u201cLook at this,\u201d he said, pointing to the partly obscured Singapore Flyer, a 540-foot-tall Ferris wheel. \u201cI wish they had haze in Jakarta. Then the government there would do something about it.\u201dMr. Singh\u2019s anger is part and parcel of a near-annual ritual: Fires set in Sumatra and the Indonesian side of Borneo blanket parts of Southeast Asia with smoke for weeks. While this has been going on for decades, an especially long dry season this year coupled with the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, threaten to make it the worst on record, scientists say.Around the region, flights have been grounded, schools have been closed, and tens of thousands of people have sought medical treatment for respiratory problems, allergies, eczema and other ailments. The first night of an international sports competition, the FINA Swimming World Cup, set for last Saturday and hosted by Singapore, was canceled because of health concerns \u2014 as was a marathon in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysia capital, set to be run the next morning.This year, there have been more vocal complaints from people affected in Singapore, Malaysia and even in Indonesia. There has also been high-profile sniping among government leaders, along with lawsuits, investigations and arrests of accused fire-starters \u2014 a familiar replay from 2013, when the region suffered its last major bout of haze.After the skies cleared in 2013, the issue was once again forgotten \u2014 until last month, when the crisis erupted anew.The consensus this year is the same as it was then: The slash-and-burn techniques used in Indonesia\u2019s palm oil industry are continuing unabated, and there is no magic bullet for ending the practice \u2014 or the haze it causes \u2014 in the short term.Finding the long-term solution requires reducing agriculture in Indonesia\u2019s carbon-rich peatland, curtailing slash-and-burn methods for clearing land and halting the conversions of forests to agricultural uses including palm oil, said Peter Holmgren, director general of the Center for International Forestry Research, a global scientific organization with its headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia.\u201cFire is the most cost-effective way of clearing, which is why it is done,\u201d he said.Finding a permanent solution is daunting enough, but more than a month into the crisis, it seems that the region cannot curb the haze in the short term. Indonesia says that its military personnel are battling more than 1,000 forest-fire clusters, while Greenpeace says that figure does not include fires that started aboveground on peatland and are now burning out of control.Up until Wednesday, Indonesia had rebuffed offers by neighbors to help it battle the blazes and had even admonished Singaporean and Malaysian leaders for daring to complain about the haze.On Thursday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia said his government had requested \u201chelp and assistance\u201d the day before from Singapore and Malaysia, as well as Russia and Japan, in getting the peatland fires under control, according to a statement released by his cabinet secretariat.Mr. Joko said his government had specifically requested firefighting aircraft with a water-carrying capacity of 12 to 15 tons, saying that Indonesian planes currently fighting the blazes have carrying capacities of between two and three tons.The aid request seemed to reflect a new seriousness from the Indonesian government.Late last month, the country\u2019s outspoken vice president, Jusuf Kalla, repeated a statement he made earlier in the year in which he said that neighboring countries \u201cshould be grateful\u201d to Indonesia for the clean air they have the other 11 months of the year.During the 2013 haze crisis, Agung Laksono, a senior Indonesian cabinet minister at the time, compared Singaporean leaders to a child having a temper tantrum after they complained about the impact that thick haze was having on tourism, which is a major contributor to Singapore\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s like a blame game,\u201d said Bustar Maitar, global leader of the Indonesia Forest Campaign at Greenpeace.\u201cOf course all the fires are coming from Indonesia, but Singapore is enjoying the \u2018deforestation economy\u2019 of Indonesia as a financial center,\u201d he said, \u201cand there are many Malaysian palm oil companies operating in Indonesia, and Singaporean companies are there as well.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Bustar said, the cycle will continue until rain forest deforestation is severely curtailed in Indonesia, where it remains rampant, and the Indonesian government bans the draining and clearing of peatland for agricultural use. Currently, Indonesian government policy allows peatland of less than about nine feet deep to be cleared.\u201cThat\u2019s the only long-term way to stop haze,\u201d he said.Then there is the issue of who is responsible for the fires. As in 2013, this time around, there has been ample finger-pointing: Multinational palm oil companies, pulp and paper companies, the smaller plantations that sell to them, traditional farmers and even day laborers have all been blamed for starting the fires \u2014 and they in turn have blamed one another.On Wednesday, NTUC FairPrice, Singapore\u2019s largest supermarket chain, released a statement saying it had pulled from its shelves toilet paper and other products sourced from Indonesia\u2019s Asia Pulp & Paper, one of the world\u2019s largest pulp and paper companies.The supermarket said it had made the move \u201cfollowing notification from the Singapore Environment Council that it has instituted a temporary restriction on the use of the \u2018Singapore Green Label\u2019 certification for A.P.P. products,\u201d the statement said.On Monday, the council had released a statement saying that it took action after an Asia Pulp & Paper subsidiary was \u201cone of five companies named by the National Environment Agency (NEA) suspected to be contributing to the haze pollution.\u201dAida Greenbury, managing director of sustainability for Asia Pulp & Paper, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was \u201cfirmly against\u201d the intentional setting of forest fires and would disengage from any supplier proven guilty of illegally starting one.\u201cWe understand why FairPrice feels the need to take urgent action and we feel the same urgency also in addressing this haze issue, but accuracy is just as important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fire situation is complex, and both the Singapore and Indonesia governments, and authorities are still investigating the situation.\u201dAng Peng Hwa, a university professor and founder of an antihaze activist group in Singapore, is promoting an American model for dealing with environmental negligence: suing those responsible, using a law passed by the Singaporean Parliament in 2014.Mr. Ang noted that under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act, Singapore-listed companies involved in illegal land clearance in Indonesia can be sued in civil court for causing financial losses to businesses and individuals.People have been coming forward to say that they have lost business because of the haze, Mr. Ang said. The prospective plaintiffs include a sporting events company and a sports training academy, though no lawsuits have yet been filed under the new law.Possible injured parties include upscale hotels that suffer canceled bookings during haze periods and the organizers of the annual F1 Singapore Grand Prix. The F1 race was held on Sept. 20 despite concerns about air quality.The problem, Mr. Ang said, is that it is very difficult to determine liability because \u201cthere are layers that protect ultimate owners of companies.\u201dYet, he said, the fact that some people have already come forward asking about financial compensation for haze through Singapore\u2019s courts leads to an inescapable conclusion that should concern governments around the region. \u201cPeople are getting more angry, more worked up.\u201dWhether that anger will lead to more lasting change is yet to be seen. Mr. Ang is not optimistic. \u201cThey burn for a period, everyone gets upset, and then people forget,\u201d he said of the fires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Timely Reminder of Bonds Funds\u2019 True Value", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise its target interest rate drew plenty of attention last quarter, but the real news for bond investors was what actually did happen.Namely, high-quality bonds delivered on their core role as life jacket in residence for diversified portfolios.When the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 12 percent from late July to late August, the $170 billion invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund and exchange-traded fund gained nearly 0.8 percent.Among actively managed funds, the $98 billon Pimco Total Return bond fund shed less than a half a percent and the $67 billion Metropolitan West Total Return bond fund gained 0.4 percent.The calm before the storm, you say? After all, the Federal Reserve didn\u2019t cancel a rate increase, but for the umpteenth time just pushed it out a bit further.True, but the timing of the first move is far less important than the magnitude of what comes after. And that\u2019s not looking nearly as ominous as what has been predicted by the bond fearmongers for the last seven years.At a news conference last month, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said that even after the initial increase, policy \u201cwill likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time.\u201dThe plain-English translation: We want to start moving our target rate from the zero level that has been in place since the financial crisis, but we are in no rush to move it much, or move it fast, given that there\u2019s no sign of our economy overheating.In its latest communiqu\u00e9 the Fed indicated that it did not expect its target interest rate to exceed 2.6 percent before 2018.\u201cThis next cycle of rising rates is going to be far more benign than past cycles,\u201d says Ford O\u2019Neil, lead manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Total bond fund (and its E.T.F. clone) and a 25-year bond market vet.That suggests long-term investors using core bond funds as portfolio diversifiers might benefit from tuning out all the anxiety about the coming rate rise.Total returns will indeed probably dip into negative territory when rates do begin to rise. Bond fund and E.T.F. total returns are the sum of interest payouts and price changes. When yields rise, prices fall. But the damage should be a bruised elbow, not a trip to the emergency room.Since 1926, there have been just five periods when intermediate-term Treasury prices fell more than 5 percent \u2014 the average was a 7 percent loss over 11 months \u2014 but losses were recouped in three to seven months, according to Morningstar. Not exactly an eternity if you\u2019re a long-term investor.But it might feel like one along the way. Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, which manages more than $140 billion in United States bond portfolios, including the MetWest Total Return bond fund, says that after seven years of extremely low volatility courtesy of the Federal Reserve\u2019s spurring a big borrowing boom \u2014 releveraging, in marketspeak \u2014 he expects volatility to snap back \u201clike a jack-in-the-box\u201d when the bond market begins its march to normalization.MetWest Total Return shifted to a \u201crisk off\u201d stance 18 months ago, given a dearth of compelling values and the fact that \u201clong releveraging cycles don\u2019t go on forever,\u201d Mr. Rivelle said. The fund\u2019s current average five-year duration, a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is more conservative than the 5.6 years for the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index. And while up to 20 percent of the fund can be invested in high-yield bonds, it currently has less than 5 percent riding on so-called junk.Thomas H. Atteberry, manager of FPA New Income, is always worried about risk. For decades the fund has been able to deliver on its two mandates: deliver a positive return over 12 months, and over a five-year stretch generate an annualized return that is at least one percentage point better than inflation. But right now the fund\u2019s five-year return is running about a quarter of a percentage point above inflation.\u201cJob 1 is protection of capital, and you can\u2019t do that and generate higher returns, given that risk-free Treasuries are yielding less than inflation,\u201d Mr. Atteberry said. Treasuries maturing in fewer than 10 years currently pay less in interest than the inflation rate. FPA New Income\u2019s average duration is below 1.5 years.Research Affiliates, which designs asset allocation and index strategies, expects even core bond funds to outpace inflation by only one percentage point annually over the next 10 years. (Before you groan at that, consider that the firm estimates the S.&P. 500\u2019s annualized real return will also be around 1 percent.)Mutual funds and E.T.F.s own a hefty share of them, and the worry is that if too many investors want to sell their shares the next time the markets hit trouble, the funds could push bonds into a downward spiral, sending prices even lower.The Loomis Sayles Bond Fund has the leeway to venture far afield from the high-grade United States issues at the heart of core bond funds, in search of higher income and returns.Over the last 15 years, the fund\u2019s 8 percent annualized gain has performed three percentage points better than the average core bond fund. A co-manager, Elaine Stokes, says the fund is currently near its 35 percent maximum allocation in high-yield bonds, a position that grew late last year when the commodity sell-off created better values.The fund also has a small slug of dividend-paying stocks, convertibles and some foreign government bonds. That generates a current yield of close to 4 percent, nearly double the income payout for core bond funds.But a seatbelt is required for times when market volatility perks up. Last quarter the fund lost more than 4 percent, as riskier bonds were yanked down in the face of global growth concerns. Similar multisector bond funds lost 2.6 percent on average.Perhaps the best risk-reward trade-off right now is municipal bonds. Yields are in line with what Treasuries currently pay out, and that\u2019s before you factor in the tax break if you\u2019re investing in a taxable account.The 1.8 percent current yield for the high-grade Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt fund is the equivalent of 2.5 percent if your federal tax bracket is 28 percent.For investors in the 35 percent tax bracket, the effective yield is 2.8 percent. That puts you well ahead of the 2.1 percent yield for the taxable Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing Election Losses, Taiwan\u2019s Governing Party Drops Its Presidential Candidate", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s governing party, the Kuomintang, dropped its presidential nominee in favor of another candidate on Saturday, in hopes of preventing what it fears will be heavy losses in the January elections.The party chose its chairman, Eric Chu, the mayor of New Taipei City, as its new presidential candidate at a special party congress. He replaced Hung Hsiu-chu, who in polls has badly trailed Tsai Ing-wen, the nominee of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, and even at times polled behind a third-party candidate.Ms. Hung resisted the change, but she was overruled by party leaders who persuaded delegates to reverse her nomination. \u201cI have said before I will accept the congress\u2019s decision,\u201d Ms. Hung, the vice president of Taiwan\u2019s legislature, told the gathering. \u201cThe party may give up on me, but I will not give up on the party.\u201dMr. Chu urged delegates to support him and put the awkward reversal behind them. \u201cWe must be confident,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must be united.\u201dThe Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, is struggling to salvage its electoral prospects just three months before the elections, in which voters will elect members of the legislature as well as the president. Political analysts say the switch to Mr. Chu was driven not just by Ms. Hung\u2019s poor showing in the presidential campaign, but by the prospect of the party\u2019s losing control of the legislature.The Kuomintang ran Taiwan as an authoritarian, one-party state until democratic reforms began in the 1980s. It favors closer relations with mainland China, which it ruled until its 1949 defeat by Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists in the country\u2019s civil war.Under President Ma Ying-jeou, who is finishing his second and final term, the Kuomintang pushed a series of trade agreements with Beijing. But concerns have grown in Taiwan about the economic sway of China, which considers the self-ruled island to be a part of its territory that must eventually be brought under its control.The party has done itself few favors with its election strategy thus far. Mr. Chu, whose mayoral victory in New Taipei City was one of the few bright spots for the Kuomintang in last year\u2019s elections, was at first widely seen as the party\u2019s likely presidential candidate. But he repeatedly declined to run.In Ms. Hung, the party wound up with a less popular nominee who pushed for even closer relations with China, a position that many analysts say further undermined the Kuomintang\u2019s already weak chances.\u201cWith incredible lack of foresight, and I suspect a generous dose of ignorance and arrogance, neither Ma nor Chu appear to have sensed that choosing Hung would exacerbate an already fraught situation for the party,\u201d Jonathan Sullivan, associate professor and director of research at the University of Nottingham\u2019s School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, said in an email. \u201cAnd for months they blithely carried on. Having made the decision to nix Hung, Chu had no choice but to run.\u201dDespite Mr. Chu\u2019s call for unity, the abrupt candidate switch may result in continued squabbling within the party as the election nears. Additionally, an opposition lawmaker has called for an investigation into allegations that Ms. Hung sought or was offered payment to withdraw from the race, a charge she has denied.On Saturday, Mr. Chu spoke of the Kuomintang as the party best equipped to handle relations with China. But while that argument helped the party in past elections, it might be less successful this time.In the past, the Democratic Progressive Party, or D.P.P., has raised concern among some of Taiwan\u2019s voters \u2014 and among some foreign countries, including the United States \u2014 that it might push for formal independence for Taiwan. But the party has de-emphasized such sentiments during this campaign.\u201cTsai has staked out the center ground where most voters are by sticking steadfastly to \u2018maintaining the status quo,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cIt is ambiguous enough and palatable enough for most players that China policy will not be an obvious Achilles\u2019 heel for the D.P.P. this time.\u201dLikewise, Taiwan\u2019s slow growth and growing income disparity in recent years have undermined the Kuomintang\u2019s traditional argument that it is the best steward of the economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaders of France\u2019s Socialist Party Defy Its Orthodoxy", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 One is the bad boy of France\u2019s Socialist government, the young former banker who has infuriated party die-hards by questioning France\u2019s devotion to the 35-hour workweek and wondering aloud about coddled civil servants.The other is the government\u2019s tough guy \u2014 on crime and immigration \u2014 equally obnoxious to the Socialist Party\u2019s old guard.That two men \u2014 the economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, and Prime Minister Manuel Valls \u2014 so at odds with French Socialism\u2019s orthodoxy are its de facto leaders is a measure of the depths of the party\u2019s struggle for direction.With the far-right National Front party surging in polls as local elections approach in December, France\u2019s politics is being relentlessly driven from the right.Yet it remains a country where public spending is 56 percent of gross domestic product, government workers are well over 20 percent of the labor force, and any hint of a loosening of economic rules prompts strikes and street protests.The emergence of the youthful tandem at the top of the Socialist government is provoking fundamental questions about the future of the party and whether it can remake \u2014 or at least moderate \u2014 itself in an era of stubborn 10 percent unemployment, chronic deficits and flat growth.It is a challenge that has become all the more urgent as the threat presented by the National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, has grown and the old Socialist Party, embodied in President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who came up through its ranks, has shown little traction with voters.Mr. Macron, the former banker, likes financiers, and Mr. Valls, the government\u2019s tough guy, likes the police. Neither speaks much about redistributing wealth. But both are far more popular now than Mr. Hollande, who drew a 22 percent approval rating in a recent poll.Through the late summer and early fall Mr. Macron has unapologetically launched pinpricks at Socialist dogma. In other contexts they would have appeared mild, but in France they have been incendiary.Mr. Macron\u2019s sorties have provoked sputters of rage from tradition-minded activists and the party\u2019s still solid base, but the economy minister, a self-confident 37-year-old, keeps on talking.On Tuesday, as Mr. Macron spoke at a conference in Lyon, a protester threw a yogurt pot at him, yelling: \u201cYou are murdering the unemployed!\u201dTwo op-ed columnists wrote recently in the newspaper Le Monde of \u201cthe disgust that the Macron-Valls axis inspires,\u201d asking, \u201cHow could the left have arrived at this point?\u201dThe answer, no doubt, derives from a political calculation of their boss, Mr. Hollande, who put them in place in a nod to his own unpopularity and lack of success in taking on his party\u2019s old guard.Despite the turbulence Mr. Macron and Mr. Valls have stirred, the president has shown no sign of reining in the two men, who may soon be serious political rivals. Mr. Hollande has pledged not to run for re-election if he cannot bring down unemployment.If Mr. Macron and Mr. Valls represent a vision of the party\u2019s future, it is one seemingly out of step with the traditions of its past.Mr. Macron appears more at ease with business leaders than workers, and through the criticism he has continued to address corporate executives and others who do not normally sit still for speeches from Socialist government ministers.Mr. Valls, 53, was recently accused by a leading Socialist parliamentarian of being nothing more than a \u201cfount of liberal ideas\u201d \u2014 in the French context, a defender of free markets. He was forced to push through a signature piece of the government\u2019s economic agenda over the heads of his own legislators this year.As the divisions within the party become ever more evident \u2014 and antagonistic \u2014 French analysts are having difficulty identifying what the Socialists actually stand for.\u201cThe governing party has neither a project nor intellectual consistency,\u201d Marcel Gauchet, a historian and philosopher, wrote last year in a leading political journal, Le D\u00e9bat. \u201cAt its top all ideological credibility has vanished.\u201dNor is it clear whom the left now represents, Mr. Gauchet said.\u201cIt prospered on its identification with \u2018the people,\u2019 \u201d he said in the review, which he edits. \u201cBut it is less and less of the working class.\u201dThe National Front, on the other hand, represents \u201cthe strongest synthesis in French politics,\u201d Mr. Gauchet said: \u201cthe confluence of nationalist claims and social welfare claims.\u201dIn fact, most analysts say the National Front will make it at least to the final round of presidential elections in 2017, if not beyond. In a poll published Sunday, Ms. Le Pen drew 31 percent support in the 2017 presidential race.Already, some analysts say the National Front could be unbeatable, having also left the conservative party led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy in early disarray.In Le D\u00e9bat, Le Monde\u2019s national editor said this month of the National Front: \u201cI don\u2019t see what could stop it.\u201dThe contempt Ms. Le Pen showed Mr. Hollande to his face last week at the European Parliament in Strasbourg demonstrated her party\u2019s confidence and ascendancy.She mockingly thanked the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also present, for \u201ccoming with your vice-chancellor administrator of province-France,\u201d Mr. Hollande.Mr. Hollande did not address Ms. Le Pen\u2019s insult \u2014 a veiled reference to France\u2019s conquered status in World War II \u2014 directly. Ms. Le Pen then further mocked his response as \u201clightweight.\u201dIn their effort to restore the stature of their party and country, Mr. Valls and Mr. Macron have pushed forward a program closer to those of the Social Democratic parties of Europe than those of traditional Socialists.Last week, after workers publicly ripped the shirts off Air France executives in a labor dispute turned violent, Mr. Valls leapt up in Parliament.But instead of defending the workers, he denounced them, saying their actions were \u201cintolerable,\u201d calling for \u201cexemplary punishments,\u201d and faulting the pilots\u2019 union for lack of \u201cresponsibility.\u201dTraditional left leaders, by contrast, defended the shirt rippers, who have since been arrested.Likewise, on Wednesday, Mr. Valls quickly moved to mollify angry police officers demonstrating over a recent shooting of one of their own, announcing new measures to strengthen law enforcement.Mr. Macron, whose past as a banker at Rothschild and Company is a constant source of reproach for Socialist Party activists, upset them this year with an economic reform law that tried to open up some professions to greater competition and has yet to make much of an impact. And he has been at it again, upsetting them consistently since late August.\u201cThe left might have thought, some time ago, that France could do better in working less,\u201d Mr. Macron told an employers\u2019 federation, in an indirect reference to the 35-hour workweek, sacred to the left but derided by economists. \u201cAll of that is now behind us,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Then he infuriated the Socialist old guard by appearing to call into question the protected status of civil servants \u2014 \u201cno longer adapted to the world as it is,\u201d Mr. Macron was quoted as saying in a briefing meant to be off the record.He has also been at war with the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, over opening up sections of the city to Sunday shopping, regarded warily by Socialists as an infringement on workers\u2019 rights and a cave-in to consumerism.Mr. Macron\u2019s Sunday-shopping plans \u201creveal the fantasy of a city turned over entirely to tourist consumerism,\u201d Ms. Hidalgo wrote in a recent letter to the economy minister.One of the staunchest of the old-line Socialist bosses, the mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, said she was \u201cfed up\u201d with the ex-banker who appears to have taken over the party\u2019s economic policy.But the prime minister has backed him. And in the French Parliament, there has been silence: A movement in its ranks dedicated to fighting the free-market turn of government policy has barely uttered a word all fall.At a meeting of producers and retailers of consumer goods, executives listened to Mr. Macron respectfully one morning recently.He told the business leaders that the state would be watching over their negotiations, especially attentive to signs that competition was being hindered. But his message on the state\u2019s limits, not its powers, was strongest.\u201cThe role of the state is not to block initiatives,\u201d the economy minister said. \u201cThe state can\u2019t do everything, and it can\u2019t be in every negotiation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Study Cites Lower Standards in Law School Admissions", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs law schools across the country try to keep their classrooms full, many are admitting students with lesser qualifications, including those with a lower admissions test score \u2014 considered an important predictor of whether a graduate will earn the credentials to practice law.Law school admissions scores closely mirror the final results of the state bar exams, which graduates must pass to qualify as licensed lawyers. Many in legal education consider a score of 150 as a telling dividing line between future success or failure.\u201cToo many law schools are filling their entering classes with people who face serious risk of not passing the bar exam,\u201d said Kyle McEntee, executive director of Law School Transparency, which he helped to found six years ago to promote more open law school practices. He said that last year 45 schools, up from eight in 2010, admitted seriously at-risk students.Most law schools maintain that test scores are only one indicator, albeit an important one, of the ability to pass the bar. They also say they need flexibility in selecting students to assure a diverse population of lawyers.Yet many schools are also facing pressure from plummeting enrollments \u2014 the lowest in decades. Law school enrollment reached a peak in 2010, as many students fled a troubled economy to the schools\u2019 safe harbor. With a swelling crop of students, bar passage rates soared, but it all began to come apart quickly when jobs in law seemed to melt away overnight as the industry adjusted to a changed economy.Threatening to further weaken laws schools\u2019 position, initial reports from states show that bar passage rates this year are again slumping.Most states have yet to report the complete results of their July 2015 bar exam, but early numbers paint a dismal picture.Law graduates typically can take the test over, and repeaters nudge up the pass rate. But the tumbling outcomes for first-time test takers are spurring debate over whether law schools should be admitting students who score poorly on the entry test. The top scores on the multiple-choice exam are between 156 and 180. Scores below 150 are viewed by many as warnings that test takers lack the skills necessary to practice law.Mr. McEntee of Law School Transparency, a graduate of Vanderbilt University Law School, said his group\u2019s recent study showed that many schools were admitting students whose lack of legal aptitude made them vulnerable to failing the bar. And, at the same time, they are incurring six-figure student debt that will weigh them down in the future.\u201cOur experience has been that someone with a 147 score could pass the bar and someone else with 160 could fail, so we don\u2019t think that there is necessarily a relationship between the test and people\u2019s ability to pass the bar,\u201d said Christopher Behan, the school\u2019s associate dean.Since 2010, Southern Illinois\u2019s bar passage rate also fell 5 percentage points, to 85.54 percent, according to the school\u2019s figures. To help students pass the bar, the school offers a free summer bar preparation course as well as a separate course in the spring. It also added another bar preparation course during the current fall semester.Mr. Behan insisted that law school remained a winning proposition, noting that 64.8 percent of its 2014 graduates had full-time jobs requiring a juris doctor degree and bar passage \u2014 outpacing the 59.9 percent national placement figure.\u201cWe had to deal with a dreadful problem with bar passage. The passage rate was 57 percent, so we were 18 percent below the state\u2019s average pass rate,\u201d said Martin J. Katz, the school\u2019s dean.\u201cWe had egg on our faces and our graduates were up in arms,\u201d Mr. Katz recalled. And since most of its graduates remain in the Denver area, those were sentiments the school could not ignore, he added.\u201cDespite 100 different theories, only a few things correlated: admissions scores and grade point averages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used any combination of them that gave the student a pass rate.\u201dFor students, the current landscape of fewer legal jobs and higher debt means they want more information when considering law school.Aaron P. Sohaski, who will graduate next year from Thomas Cooley Law School in Michigan, said law schools \u201cneed to be more transparent about what the outcomes can be.\u201dWhile most law schools say no drastic changes are needed, Rebecca W. Berch, retired chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, who is currently chairwoman of the A.B.A.\u2019s national accrediting body for legal education, said: \u201cI\u2019d like law schools to be up-front, telling students that your indicators say you may not have what it takes to pass the bar.\u201dJustice Berch said that there has been debate over instituting a \u201cmini bar\u201d to test students after their first year of law school, but noted that it would be difficult and expensive to administer to about 40,000 students yearly. California demands what is called a baby bar for certain first-year students, including those at unaccredited law schools in the state, but that affects a smaller number of students.Such warnings are not sufficient, said Mr. McEntee, who is urging the A.B.A. to tighten standards now because student debt is rising, with an average of $118,670 in 2014, plus interest.At-risk law students, Mr. McEntee said, \u201chave little chance of gainful employment in order to pay off the debt they are accumulating.\u201dAn article on Oct. 27 about the correlation between lower admitting standards to law school and a rising proportion of law students\u2019 failing the bar exam misstated which first-year law students California requires to take a \u201cbaby bar\u201d to gauge their progress. The requirement applies to students of unaccredited law schools, many of which are for-profit. It does not apply only to for-profit law schools. The error was only recently called to The Times\u2019s attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi\u2019s Visit to Britain Highlights Broader Shift in Concerns About China", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisPrime Minister David Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, have muted public criticism of Chinese political, military and human rights behavior since 2012, and during Mr. Xi\u2019s visit here over the past several days, they have highlighted how increased trade and investment can create more British jobs.But the shifting European calculations about the allure of doing business with China are hardly limited to Britain, and extend to Germany, Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse, among other countries. Berlin, too, has been assiduous in its courtship of Beijing and has been hardly strident in its comments on China\u2019s domestic abuses of human rights or its growing military might in Asia.Having built a dynamic economy on exports of advanced industrial goods, especially automobiles, Germany\u2019s growth has been partly tied to that of China, which is now its second-largest market, after France.In a real sense, Britain\u2019s push now for a \u201cgolden era\u201d with China, as Mr. Cameron put it, is in direct competition with Germany and, to a lesser degree, France, a country that has been generally more outspoken in its criticism of China.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Germany\u2019s total of about 45 percent of European Union exports to China dwarfs Britain\u2019s 10 percent and France\u2019s 9 percent. And Germany is the only European Union country, besides Finland, to have a positive trade balance with Beijing. Britain, by contrast, has by far the largest trade deficit with China of the five largest bloc economies, about \u20ac11.4 billion.Mr. Osborne in particular sees Britain\u2019s future as a trading nation tied up with a rising and wealthy China. He has made great efforts to praise Beijing and even \u201ctake a bit of a risk with the China relationship,\u201d as he said, by visiting the restive Xinjiang region, where Uighur separatists have been repressed by the central government.Britain, Mr. Osborne said, wanted to be \u201cChina\u2019s best partner in the West,\u201d even as the Chinese economy is slowing, and he has tried to prove it, causing frustration and even anger in Washington, especially as Mr. Xi has cracked down on dissent and censored the Internet.China, like Russia, regards the European Union as an artificial political construct and emphasizes bilateral relations with different countries, sometimes setting one off against another.Germany, too, has not been above putting its economic interests before those of other Europeans. In one prominent example, the country undermined the position of the European Commission last year in a tariff dispute with China over the import or \u201cdumping\u201d of cheap solar panels. Germany was not alone in opposition, but it weakened the commission\u2019s negotiating stance before a minimum price for the panels was set.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has also been accused of playing down human rights for economic interests, and she inevitably brings with her to China high-level German business representatives.But she has been more outspoken about noneconomic issues than the British have been. Being more important to China than Britain, and given its history, Germany does not keep entirely silent about Chinese abuses, but the criticism is rarely public. Mr. Xi made a major visit to Berlin in 2014 and praised Berlin and Beijing as \u201ctwo pillars of growth in Asia and Europe.\u201dMs. Merkel briefs reporters on her conversations with the Chinese, which inevitably include at least nominal discussions about human rights and especially cybersecurity and the Chinese hacking of German companies.But she, too, has modulated her voice. In 2007, she met with the Dalai Lama, but China reacted angrily, and in the years after, according to Der Spiegel, she has largely kept her criticism private and has not made many public gestures toward dissidents, earning praise from the Chinese government\u2019s English-language mouthpiece, Global Times.\u201cMerkel once took the lead among European leaders in meeting the Dalai Lama,\u201d the newspaper wrote in 2012. \u201cGermany has the ability to lead a more independent diplomacy in global politics. It should not bury itself in old Europe.\u201dLast year, in response to Ms. Merkel, the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, was quick to point out that China and Germany were \u201cboth victims of hacking attacks,\u201d a clear reference to revelations by Edward J. Snowden about American cyberespionage against the two countries.Mr. Ai told Sky News this week that \u201cthe British prime minister has had a record on putting human rights aside, which is very bad strategy and also is a very bad aesthetics, because this certainly doesn\u2019t represent the British people.\u201dIn a paper last December for the European Council on Foreign Relations, Fran\u00e7ois Godement, a noted French expert on China, called for more European Union unity on human rights. The weakness of European efforts, he said, stems from \u201cChina\u2019s use of its economic leverage, Europe\u2019s current crisis of confidence and the crowding out of Chinese human rights issues by pressing geopolitical concerns closer to Europe.\u201dThe failure of Europe\u2019s human rights approach to China is documented, he noted, in a 2014 study by Katrin Kinzelbach, \u201cThe E.U.\u2019s Human Rights Dialogue With China: Quiet Diplomacy and Its Limits.\u201d The study describes quiet diplomacy but also the active opposition of China, including the last-minute cancellation of meetings and the execution of a man whose case was raised by Brussels the same morning a human rights dialogue was starting in Beijing.\u201cKinzelbach asks the difficult question \u2014 where did Europe\u2019s quiet diplomacy have an impact?\u201d Mr. Godement writes, noting the constant compromise between professed European values and economic expediency.She quotes a European participant who explained: \u201cI am not aware that the E.U. has demanded results,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is just a venue for us to express concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Closing the Gender Gap by Changing Minds", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe real achievement of \u201cLean In,\u201d however, is its success in synthesizing, in an accessible and actionable way, a wide swath of social science research touching on multiple distinct impediments to progress for women. Its practical recommendations are addressed to employers, policy makers and life partners as much as to women themselves.Her essay was prompted by her decision to return to work at Princeton from a two-year stint at the State Department \u2013 a choice many academics have made, Ms. Slaughter points out, to avoid losing tenure. She notes that her husband, who had remained behind with the children in New Jersey, willingly took on the majority of care responsibilities, and she insists that Hillary Rodham Clinton was a sensitive and accommodating boss. And Ms. Slaughter leaves no doubt that she has no problem \u201cleaning in.\u201dWhat instead infuriated Ms. Slaughter \u2013 she describes it as triggering a \u201cblind fury\u201d \u2013 were the judgmental and patronizing reactions she confronted on her departure from Washington. These apparently treated her choice as not only \u201csad or unfortunate\u201d but suggested that her parenting or commitment to her profession \u201cwere somehow substandard.\u201dAlthough there are plenty of policy recommendations, mostly seen before elsewhere, the emphasis is on changing minds, not laws. An entire chapter, for instance, is devoted to the way we talk, which includes a discussion of whether the terms \u201cjuggling\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d are offensive and concludes with Ms. Slaughter\u2019s preference for the awkward phrase \u201cwork/life fit.\u201d Ms. Slaughter describes the book\u2019s ambition as making us \u201ccome together as women and men\u201d to \u201cchange how we think, how we talk, how we plan and work and vote.\u201d\u201cUnfinished Business\u201d retains the form and tone of the shorter original but adds extensive excerpts from the \u201cthousands of readers\u201d who Ms. Slaughter says either wrote her directly or otherwise commented on the article. In addition, Ms. Slaughter went on a \u201clistening tour,\u201d giving hundreds of speeches she describes as a form of \u201ccall and response research.\u201dGiven its genesis and aspirations, \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d is surprisingly condescending toward other women\u2019s views and efforts. Ms. Slaughter\u2019s treatment of Ms. Sandberg, whose perspective is largely complementary to Ms. Slaughter\u2019s, is indicative.Ms. Slaughter complains that \u201cLean In\u201d tells women \u201cthat the fate of their careers and families is within their control,\u201d which is \u201djust not true.\u201d The difficulty with the critique is that \u201cLean In\u201d doesn\u2019t make this claim in the first place. Ms. Slaughter also understates the influence of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s book, which has led many chief executives and husbands (including me) I have encountered to reconsider the extent to which they have been part of the problem.The first third of Ms. Slaughter\u2019s book is devoted to demolishing this and other straw men (or women as the case may be). In place of these \u201chalf truths\u201d thus vanquished, she suggests that she alone has seen the \u201cwhole truth.\u201d Ms. Slaughter goes on to forgive Ms. Sandberg her youth and inexperience: \u201cI would have written a very similar book to \u2018Lean In' at 43.\u201dMs. Slaughter, who is in her mid-50s, reserves her greatest condescension for those in their 60s and 70s. It is this \u201cincreasingly judgmental\u201d group, in her view, that is most responsible for perpetuating false assumptions about the ease and importance of \u201chaving it all.\u201dFor an author whose expertise is international relations, the lack of diplomacy in \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d feels strange and gratuitous. Where Ms. Slaughter has opportunity to make common cause, she goes out of her way to create division.Even when promoting well-worn and sensible policy ideas on topics like flexible work schedules and valuing care work, Ms. Slaughter manages to position herself as an innovator. This is likely to grate on those who have spent decades in the trenches working to make these reforms a reality. Establishing \u201chaving it all\u201d as a target in the first place \u2013 a phrase about which she now manages to express \u201cambivalence\u201d\u2013 seemed intended to generate artificial conflict.After all, as Ms. Sandberg pointed out in her book, without mentioning Ms. Slaughter, \u201cthe very concept \u2026 flies in the face of the basic laws of economics and common sense.\u201dToward the end of \u201cLean In,\u201d Ms. Sandberg reviewed the social psychology literature around the tendency of women themselves in certain environments to perpetuate gender bias and recommended some ways to avoid falling into this trap. The institutional tendency to use minor disagreements among women as an excuse to do nothing, she argues, requires women to choose their battles carefully.\u201cWe should resolve our differences quickly, and when we disagree, stay focused on our shared goals. This is not a plea for less debate, but for more constructive debate,\u201d Ms. Sandberg wrote. Based on Ms. Slaughter\u2019s book, it would seem that persuading other powerful women to respond positively to Ms. Sandberg\u2019s appeal is another piece of unfinished business.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "A Shifting Approach to Saving Endangered Species", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA more surprising development was that many other environmental organizations applauded the decision and the Interior Department\u2019s proactive approach: With the threat of regulation under the Endangered Species Act hanging in the background, the department prodded states, federal agencies and private landowners to work together on a conservation plan that could make an endangered listing unnecessary.To many conservationists, though, the government\u2019s decision to avoid listing the grouse reflects a larger shift in thinking that is taking hold in academic departments and advocacy circles around the country, even as it stirs controversy.Traditional approaches to species conservation have focused on saving individual animals or plants in specific locations, with the goal of restoring as much land as possible to its former pristine condition. Conservation efforts \u2014 walling off areas to preserve habitat, for example \u2014 have been structured around a particular species\u2019 needs, with little or no attempt to reconcile those protections with the larger needs of human society. And regulatory solutions have taken precedence over financial or other incentive-based tactics, with landowners and companies often viewed as hostile actors.But a growing number of conservationists argue that this view is far too narrow, especially in an era of climate change and rapid population growth.By the end of the century, according to projections, as many as 10 billion humans will be competing with other species for available space. And changes in climate are already forcing species to move into new terrains, migrations that will increase in the future.For conservation to succeed, some environmentalists argue, it must work on a larger scale, focusing not on preserving single species in small islands of wilderness but on large landscapes and entire ecosystems, and the benefits that nature provides to humans.Conservation efforts, according to this view, will be more effective if they accept humans as a part of nature and come to terms with the fact that they have irrevocably altered the landscape.And instead of seeing landowners and leaseholders, who control the vast majority of the land where endangered species live, as enemies, many conservationists believe it makes more sense to enlist them as partners, convincing them that conservation is in their interests.In particular, the notion that human-altered landscapes should be seen as a legitimate part of nature does not sit well with many environmental advocates. They argue that those who define nature this way have essentially given up on nature.Distrust of industry has traditionally run deep in environmental circles, and the idea that farmers, oil companies or other land users would honor promises to protect habitat and species without being forced to do so has also drawn skepticism.In the weeks since the decision, two Nevada counties, some mining companies and the State of Idaho have filed lawsuits over restrictions on drilling, mining and other land uses that are part of the conservation plan.And some environmental groups have said that they are contemplating legal challenges to the government\u2019s ruling.\u201cWe\u2019re one of the richest countries in the world and yet we\u2019re putting this incredibly paltry amount of money into\u201d endangered species, he said.The act was aimed at providing \u201cemergency room treatment,\u201d as one scientist put it, for species on the brink of extinction.Most lived in relatively contained areas and were endangered by single threats like hunting or pollution that could be identified and removed. The law prohibited actions that further jeopardized endangered species and mandated efforts to restore habitat and increase species\u2019 numbers.In recent years, conservative Republicans have stepped up attacks on the statute. Since January, Republican legislators have introduced 71 measures that seek to dismantle some of the law\u2019s provisions, reduce financing for species or exclude some.Conservationists from all camps defend the Endangered Species Act, noting that it is the nation\u2019s strongest environmental law, and they are loath to discuss its strengths and weaknesses when it is under assault in Congress. But some said they also think the statute is outdated and that it is not used as effectively as it could be.Some of the most serious critiques come from environmental scientists identified with the school of thought known as \u201cecosystem services,\u201d which focuses on the benefits that nature provides to humans: for example, food and water, clean air, and less tangible benefits like spiritual well-being.As a result, conservation has been \u201ca lose-lose battle,\u201d said Dr. Daily, who is an author of \u201cThe New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable,\u201d an influential 2002 book.She and other scientists said that the law could not hope to address the challenges of a world where whole ecosystems were threatened and vast areas of habitat were disappearing.And some endangered species are under assault from so many directions that the current recovery plans developed under the act are unlikely to succeed.The key deer may be one such example. With its migration routes blocked by development and its habitat shrinking, the deer have already suffered the effects of illegal dumping and open pit mining. Many have been killed by car and truck traffic, and attacked by feral dogs.The federal recovery plan calls for them to stay in the Florida Keys. But with rising sea level and the incursion of saltwater, fresh water supplies will disappear before the islands themselves are underwater, and without water to drink, the chances for the deer\u2019s continued survival in its original habitat may be slim.\u201cIf the projections of climate change and its impact on ecosystems hold true for the next 25 years, the act will simply be overwhelmed,\u201d Professor Ruhl said.In that future, he and other environmental experts said, humans will take up more and more space on the planet, their need for food, energy and material goods swallowing up the available land, leaving less for other species. And society will ultimately have to set priorities and make difficult decisions.In some cases, scientists said, that might mean moving species whose habitats have disappeared to other regions or preserving them in limited numbers. Or it might mean devoting the majority of recovery efforts to species that play crucial ecosystem or evolutionary roles, and accepting that by doing so, others may go extinct.\u201cWe have to prepare ourselves to make better choices about what is going to come along for the ride with us and where and in what numbers,\u201d said Mr. Ashe, of the Fish and Wildlife Service.There is no biological or ethical framework for making such decisions, Mr. Ashe said. And as he has learned from experience, it is a topic that few environmentalists want to discuss. \u201cThey either close their ears or they criticize you,\u201d he said.One environmental advocate called even the idea of making choices among species \u201cthe height of biological arrogance.\u201d Another said that to do so was immoral.Yet in the absence of reasoned guidelines, decisions are made by default, with a small percentage of species \u2014 often those that serve commercial interests or are popular with the public \u2014 receiving the bulk of money. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, more than $10 million in state and federal money was devoted to the grizzly bear, and more than $34 million to the upper Columbia spring run Chinook salmon.In contrast, $214 was spent on the desert slender salamander and $400 on the Alabama cavefish.Despite their differences, conservationists from the older and newer schools have some common ground. They agree, for example, that some species may need protection under the Endangered Species Act for many decades, if not permanently, and that efforts to protect a species or an ecosystem should begin much earlier than they do now to improve the chances of succeeding.Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, argued that nature should be preserved for its own sake and protected from human intruders. Pinchot, the first head of the Forest Service, saw humans as stewards of nature, entitled to use land for agriculture, logging and grazing as long as they did so wisely.The two views, some environmental scientists said, need not be contradictory, even in their modern form.Advertisement"}

The lawsuit centers on new regulations that require owners of nonunionized carwashes to post a $150,000 surety bond before obtaining a license. Unionized operations would pay $30,000.Michael A. Cardozo, the lawyer representing the carwash owners, said the two-tier system was illegal, violating past decisions by the United States Supreme Court that limit local governments\u2019 ability to favor or discourage collective bargaining. By making it less costly for those who have collective bargaining to obtain a license, the city law gave them a competitive advantage, Mr. Cardozo said.\u201cGovernments can\u2019t put their thumb on the scales of whether a company should unionize or not unionize,\u201d Mr. Cardozo, a former top lawyer for the city, said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically coercing them into entering a collective bargaining agreement.\u201dNick Paolucci, a spokesman for the New York City Law Department, said, \u201cWe will review the complaint to evaluate the merits of their claims, but believe that the legislation is legally sound and serves to protect hard-working carwash workers.\u201dThe law is the first major challenge to City Council\u2019s overhaul of the carwash industry in favor of its low-wage workers, known as the Car Wash Accountability Act. Passed in June after several years of legal wrangling, the law prohibits employers from performing background checks before making a job offer and requires that they put up surety bonds to guarantee payouts if they are found guilty of underpaying employees.The law drew large support from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union and the advocacy organization Make the Road, two groups that have targeted the carwash industry in efforts to expand collective bargaining. But so far, few of New York\u2019s roughly 200 carwash operations have unionized.The law would change the balance on that, according to the complaint. The $150,000 surety bond \u2014 an amount paid for by a third-party insurance company that must be personally guaranteed by the carwash owner \u2014 would put undue burden on small carwash owners who did not unionize, the owners argued.Mr. Cardozo gave the example of several small clients that would be unlikely to keep up with the requirement, like one called Zoom Car Spa on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The nonunion carwash has 16 employees, Mr. Cardozo said, and would soon feel pressure to enter a collective bargaining agreement.\u201cYou would have to change your whole operation to avoid the law completely or go out of business,\u201d he said.Mr. Cardozo said he would be seeking an injunction from the court that would allow owners to not seek the bonds until the matter had been settled.Robin Levine, spokeswoman for Melissa Mark-Viverito, speaker of the City Council, who originally sponsored the regulations, defended the law as necessary to protect workers.\u201cOur legislation brings much-needed regulation to an industry that\u2019s fraught with shameful wage theft and labor violations,\u201d she said. \u201cOur law protects both the consumers who patronize carwashes and the vulnerable, low-wage employees who work there.\u201dSteve Rotlevi, who heads the carwash association and whose carwash is one of the plaintiffs, called the new laws \u201cpure legislative extortion and special interest politics at its worst.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat the City Council and mayor did not only hurts our industry, it is an attack on the economy and all small businesses of this city.\u201dThe carwash owners also received an unusual ally in Mr. Cardozo, who worked for former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as the city\u2019s corporation counsel, the post that defends the city against similar legal challenges to its legislation. Mr. Cardozo said he was allowed to pursue the case because it was not a matter he handled during his tenure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Something Not Rotten in Denmark", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo doubt surprising many of the people watching the Democratic presidential debate, Bernie Sanders cited Denmark as a role model for how to help working people. Hillary Clinton demurred slightly, declaring that \u201cwe are not Denmark,\u201d but agreed that Denmark is an inspiring example.Such an exchange would have been inconceivable among Republicans, who don\u2019t seem able to talk about European welfare states without adding the word \u201ccollapsing.\u201d Basically, on Planet G.O.P. all of Europe is just a bigger version of Greece. But how great are the Danes, really?The answer is that the Danes get a lot of things right, and in so doing refute just about everything U.S. conservatives say about economics. And we can also learn a lot from the things Denmark has gotten wrong.Describe these policies to any American conservative, and he would predict ruin. Surely those generous benefits must destroy the incentive to work, while those high taxes drive job creators into hiding or exile.It\u2019s hard to imagine a better refutation of anti-tax, anti-government economic doctrine, which insists that a system like Denmark\u2019s would be completely unworkable.But would Denmark\u2019s model be impossible to reproduce in other countries? Consider France, another country that is much bigger and more diverse than Denmark, but also maintains a highly generous welfare state paid for with high taxes. You might not know this from the extremely bad press France gets, but the French, too, roughly match U.S. productivity, and are more likely than Americans to be employed during their prime working years. Taxes and benefits just aren\u2019t the job killers right-wing legend asserts.Going back to Denmark, is everything copacetic in Copenhagen? Actually, no. Denmark is very rich, but its economy has taken a hit in recent years, because its recovery from the global financial crisis has been slow and incomplete. In fact, Denmark\u2019s 5.5 percent decline in real G.D.P. per capita since 2007 is comparable to the declines in debt-crisis countries like Portugal or Spain, even though Denmark has never lost the confidence of investors.What explains this poor recent performance? The answer, mainly, is bad monetary and fiscal policy. Denmark hasn\u2019t adopted the euro, but it manages its currency as if it had, which means that it has shared the consequences of monetary mistakes like the European Central Bank\u2019s 2011 interest rate hike. And while the country has faced no market pressure to slash spending \u2014 Denmark can borrow long-term at an interest rate of only 0.84 percent \u2014 it has adopted fiscal austerity anyway.The result is a sharp contrast with neighboring Sweden, which doesn\u2019t shadow the euro (although it has made some mistakes on its own), hasn\u2019t done much austerity, and has seen real G.D.P. per capita rise while Denmark\u2019s falls.But Denmark\u2019s monetary and fiscal errors don\u2019t say anything about the sustainability of a strong welfare state. In fact, people who denounce things like universal health coverage and subsidized child care tend also to be people who demand higher interest rates and spending cuts in a depressed economy. (Remember all the talk about \u201cdebasing\u201d the dollar?) That is, U.S. conservatives actually approve of some Danish policies \u2014 but only the ones that have proved to be badly misguided.So yes, we can learn a lot from Denmark, both its successes and its failures. And let me say that it was both a pleasure and a relief to hear people who might become president talk seriously about how we can learn from the experience of other countries, as opposed to just chanting \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201dCharles M. Blow is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Ecuador", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate21 PhotosA MODERN FOUR-BEDROOM VILLA WITH A POOL OUTSIDE QUITO$2.2 MILLIONThis two-story house, with four bedrooms and four and a half baths, was built in 2005 on a hillside in the Cumbay\u00e1 Valley, about a 10-minute drive from Quito\u2019s historic center. It is part of Rancho San Francisco, a 54-acre gated community including Club Rancho San Francisco, with tennis courts, swimming pools and equestrian facilities.\u201cSan Francisco is probably the most prestigious community in the area,\u201d said Stephen Marchant, an independent real estate agent and owner of QuitoHomes.com, a listings and information site. The 8,600-square-foot home sits on a grassy plateau surrounded by palm trees, offering wide views of the valley. It has a practice putting green and a swimming pool next to a wide covered terrace with stone floors, wide arches and hardwood columns.The home is owned by an interior designer, according to Paulina Mora, the commercial manager of Nexos Inmobiliarios, the listing agent for the property. Features include domed ceilings, stone walls and fixtures of dark hardwood, including furniture and built-in bookcases. Ceilings in the main dining room and the family room have intricate wood carvings imported from India. The home is priced at $2.2 million unfurnished, or $2.5 million with the furniture included, Ms. Mora says. (Ecuador uses the United States dollar as its primary currency.)The ground floor has a large entrance hall with flagstone flooring, a modern kitchen, a dining room and a living room with one of the four fireplaces in the house. Wood and glass doors in the living room and dining room lead to the terrace, with valley views. The master bedroom is also on the ground floor and has a walk-in closet, a personal gym and a bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub, as well as doors leading to the terrace.A staircase with hardwood banisters leads to the second floor, where there is also a living area currently used as an office. Each of the three bedrooms on this level has a walk-in closet and private bath, as well as access to a balcony facing the valley.The main house has two bedrooms for staff, each with its own entrance and bathroom. There is a covered garage big enough for four cars.There are strict rules on development in Rancho San Francisco, Ms. Mora said. Owners can build on only 70 percent of available land and houses cannot exceed two stories, in order to preserve views, she said.The home is about a 25-minute drive from Mariscal Sucre International Airport outside Quito. A commercial area with shopping and restaurants is about a 10-minute drive from the house. MARKET OVERVIEWFrom 2006 to 2014, the market in Ecuador was \u201cbooming,\u201d Mr. Marchant said. The country was regularly appearing on lists of top off-the-beaten-path second-home destinations, based on the relatively low prices and the warm climate. While home sales data is sparse in Ecuador, prices in some neighborhoods have more than doubled in the last 10 years, agents say.But the market has slowed in the past year, agents report. The drop in oil prices has hurt the economy, which relies heavily on oil exports, and government officials have raised the possibility of increasing property and capital gains taxes, dampening the market, Mr. Marchant said.Prices are no longer rising in most areas, and some owners eager to sell have started to lower their prices, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a seller\u2019s market, and now we\u2019re getting into a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Mr. Marchant said. \u201cThere is uncertainty in the market.\u201dFew properties are available for sale in high-end neighborhoods like Rancho San Francisco, Ms. Mora said. In Rancho San Francisco, a lot of about a third of an acre that sold for $750,000 in March 2014 would be listed at closer to $920,000 today, Ms. Mora said. \u201cAlthough sales activity in Ecuador\u00a0has gone down from the past couple of years, there are sectors where supply is very low and demand is very high,\u201d Ms. Mora said. \u201cAs a result housing\u00a0prices are maintained or continue to rise, which\u00a0is the case with properties in\u00a0Rancho San Francisco.\u201dWHO BUYS IN ECUADORQuito is primarily a business city, and does not have the same number of international second-home buyers found on the coast and in the hills. But the capital still attracts a steady flow of international buyers, thanks to Ecuador\u2019s oil business, which draws companies from around the world. Buyers from the Middle East, North America and Asia are common in Ecuador, as well as from South America, agents say. In Rancho San Francisco, \u201cmost of the buyers are Ecuadoreans, but American and European\u00a0buyers are active in the neighborhood as well,\u201d Ms. Mora said.BUYING BASICSEcuador does not have a multiple listings service, so it can be difficult for buyers to track down properties for sale. Agents typically work for sellers, not buyers. Buyers are left to search for properties on the Internet or hire a local buyer\u2019s agent to help hunt down properties offered through various agencies in the area, agents say.There are no restrictions on foreigners buying property, said Sebasti\u00e1n Cordero, a Quito-based lawyer specializing in property and immigration issues. But it is important to hire an independent lawyer to confirm there are no liens against the property or any other restrictions that might slow the sale, he said. There is no escrow system in Ecuador, so buyers must be particularly careful about how they transfer money, Mr. Cordero said. Sellers often ask for a refundable deposit, often as much as 10 percent of the purchase, which should be transferred only when there is a signed and notarized promissory note, he advises clients.Problems can also arise in the process of transferring money into the country, since nonresidents cannot set up bank accounts or obtain a mortgage, Mr. Cordero said. He advises clients to allow from 10 to 30 days to wire money into the country. Payments are usually made by certified check, he said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; United States dollarTAXES AND FEESTotal closing costs, including the notary and registration costs, are typically about 2.5 percent to 4 percent of the purchase price, agents say. Annual property taxes are typically about 1 percent of the value of the property set by the local municipality, not of the sales price. (The value placed on a home by the municipality is often lower than the sales price, agents say.)When a homeowner sells, the capital gains tax is 10 percent of the profit. CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bringing Republicans to the Climate Change Table", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe climate has been changing forever. It will continue to change. Some scientists believe that humans have a direct impact on it. But trying to curb carbon emissions to slow the change could destroy the economy, eliminate millions of jobs and cast Americans into poverty.\u201cThe Republican Party was much less unified around climate before,\u201d said David Goldston, who runs the government affairs program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIt has gotten more and more right-wing and become more and more single-minded on the issue.\u201dPresident George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney, may have been closely tied to Big Oil and done nothing to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. Still, added Mr. Goldston, \u201cit was never ever the position of the Bush administration that climate change was not a real and man-made phenomenon.\u201d\u201cMcCain was a champ,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, head of the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks Congress members\u2019 stance on environmental issues. \u201cHe would go around the country and talk about climate change. Even when he was the nominee, he didn\u2019t walk away. But when a member of the Tea Party ran against him in the 2010 primary, he went south and never came back.\u201dThis shift has made it impossible to pass any legislation in Congress to help deal with the problem. That has forced President Obama to adopt a different approach.Is it possible to turn the Republican Party around?But there is more than money to the story. For many Republicans, climate change poses an existential quagmire. \u201cTo them it sounds like, \u2018Everything we\u2019ve been doing since the Industrial Revolution is going to kill us; the response must be a big government response and, by the way, it has to be international,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Goldston.For the angry supporters of the Tea Party, opposed to government spending in almost any form, the prescription is anathema. \u201cIf you decide climate change is real, there must be a role for government to combat it. So the only way out is to deny it exists,\u201d Mr. Karpinski said.For all these obstacles, though, it may be possible to thread a solution through the tangle of ideology and money.\u201cI can count eight, 10, maybe 12 Republicans in the Senate who are waiting for the jailbreak,\u201d said Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. \u201cWhen the moment comes, they could all jump together.\u201dStraight denial is getting tougher as the scientific consensus strengthens. And China\u2019s efforts to cut emissions have defanged the argument that it is pointless for the United States to act alone.In this context, the Obama administration\u2019s strategy of using the Clean Air Act to force emissions cuts could help change the politics.\u201cSome Republican governors will start taking action because the alternative is for the federal government to impose something,\u201d Mr. Goldston said. \u201cThis will change the politics. Maybe in the next Congress or the one after that, people will think they need to work something out legislatively.\u201dThe critical thing to understand is that a Republican-compatible strategy to slow the changing climate does exist.This is a message not just for climate deniers on the right but also for environmental activists on the left.Eli Lehrer, who runs the R Street Institute, a fairly conventional conservative research firm except that it supports a carbon tax to combat climate change, argued that the Republicans\u2019 stance was \u201ca direct reaction to the Democrats\u2019 efforts to use scientific facts to try to dictate public policy.\u201dSure, climate change is real, Mr. Lehrer acknowledged. Yet \u201cthe science doesn\u2019t \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 demand any particular public policy and certainly doesn\u2019t dictate that we do what the left wants.\u201dTo break the logjam, not to mention overcome the Koch brothers\u2019 money, liberal advocates might have to temper their ambitions. Pushing for a maximalist strategy could be a prescription for ensuring that no environmental agenda is enacted at all.An earlier version of this column misstated the year that cap-and-trade legislation was defeated in the Senate.

{"Headline": "Lawmakers Wrangle Over Plans to Avert, Manage or Embrace Default", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislative math has only grown more difficult. When Congress last voted in February 2014 to suspend the debt limit, 28 House Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in support; 199 Republicans were opposed. Now there are fewer Democrats in the House and if all 188 of them voted for an increase, Republican leaders would need 30 votes from their side for a 218-vote majority \u2014 two more than last year.Yet nine of last year\u2019s 28 Republican supporters have left Congress and at least three of their Republican successors \u2014 Representatives Dave Brat of Virginia, Steve Knight of California and Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina \u2014 are almost certain to be opposed. Also, 14 Democrats who voted to increase the debt limit are gone, replaced by Republicans, some of whom are likely to vote no.\u201cYou have got to be able to say that something is big enough that you would shut down the government,\u201d Mr. Knight told a California radio station on Friday. Mr. Knight, who replaced Howard McKeon, a Republican supporter of the last debt-ceiling increase, added, \u201cWe have got to stop digging at some point and make people understand that we have got to have a balanced budget that works on knocking down the deficit, or our children are going to have a much, much different country.\u201dRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday that he did not think a debt-ceiling increase could pass the House without significant spending cuts attached, a deal President Obama has repeatedly said he will not negotiate.Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities, the Washington analyst who this week warned clients of the hazards ahead, predicted that the borrowing limit would be lifted.\u201cBut we are basing that on nothing more than blind faith,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, the Treasury has never been in such a difficult position going into a debt ceiling showdown with Congress.\u201dThe Treasury Department has recently seen lower-than-expected revenue collections, and it faces big payments in November for Social Security, military pay, federal salaries and interest to creditors. For seven months, when the government bumped up against the current $18.1 trillion debt limit, the Treasury has been taking so-called extraordinary measures \u2014 shifts among federal accounts that avoid the need for more cash. But those steps will be exhausted by Nov. 3, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, told congressional leaders in a letter last week.Leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress had long expected a December deadline. Now, facing the need for expedited action, they are beset by chaos. Hard-line conservatives pressed Speaker John A. Boehner to announce his resignation, leaving the party openly at war over a successor. Those same conservatives, the roughly 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus, are emboldened to force the kind of debt-limit confrontation with Mr. Obama that they say Mr. Boehner shied away from.\u201cIt\u2019s a three-ring circus over there,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat, \u201cwhich you might laugh at, except the consequences are so serious.\u201dThe proposal could come to a House vote by Friday.\u201cIf we are going to increase the borrowing authority of the country, then we need to do something that actually addresses the big problem, the $19 trillion debt,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, who leads the Freedom Caucus. \u201cWe need to go out as a group and say, \u2018Here we are, Mr. President, we\u2019ll allow the borrowing authority to go up, if you do this.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRepresentative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, similarly said Congress first must act to reduce spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \u2014 the fast-growing benefit programs \u2014 and should not be deterred by warnings of tumult in the market and broader economy that some analysts say would inevitably follow default.The market \u201cwill make its determinations,\u201d Mr. Amash said. \u201cBut it\u2019s more important for members of Congress to do the right thing in the long run that will be better for the stock market in the long run and convey the message that there\u2019s no chance of default.\u201dOn Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said the Senate would await House action. Senate Republicans, too, would like to attach some conditions, he said, but he declined to specify what those might include.Yet with time running out, what the House will vote on Wednesday and send to the Senate falls far short of the needed debt-limit increase.The \u201cDefault Prevention Act,\u201d as Republicans call it, is a variation on their past proposals to give priority to certain obligations that can be covered by incoming tax receipts if the debt limit is breeched \u2014 in this case, creditors and the nation\u2019s most politically popular program, Social Security. But the administration, like President George W. Bush\u2019s before it, said that is unrealistic, since the 80 million payments each month are disbursed automatically and tax receipts fluctuate greatly.\u201cIt would be untenable for the United States to pick and choose which payments to default on,\u201d said a posting on the Treasury Department website. \u201cIt is simply default by another name\u201d and \u201cwould undermine confidence in the creditworthiness of the United States.\u201dThe White House issued a stern veto threat on Tuesday evening.Privately, some Republicans concede the vote is a way for members to seem to oppose default. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economics adviser to Republicans and the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, called it \u201cpolitical cover but not a solution of any type.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that you can pretend that taking out the Pentagon budget and a huge chunk of the domestic budget is not going to be damaging,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will.

{"Headline": "In Heroin Crisis, White Families Seek Gentler War on Drugs", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWTON, N.H. \u2014 When Courtney Griffin was using heroin, she lied, disappeared, and stole from her parents to support her $400-a-day habit. Her family paid her debts, never filed a police report and kept her addiction secret \u2014 until she was found dead last year of an overdose.At Courtney\u2019s funeral, they decided to acknowledge the reality that redefined their lives: Their bright, beautiful daughter, just 20, who played the French horn in high school and dreamed of living in Hawaii, had been kicked out of the Marines for drugs. Eventually, she overdosed at her boyfriend\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, where she died alone.\u201cWhen I was a kid, junkies were the worst,\u201d Doug Griffin, 63, Courtney\u2019s father, recalled in their comfortable home here in southeastern New Hampshire. \u201cI used to have an office in New York City. I saw them.\u201dNoting that \u201cjunkies\u201d is a word he would never use now, he said that these days, \u201cthey\u2019re working right next to you and you don\u2019t even know it. They\u2019re in my daughter\u2019s bedroom \u2014 they are my daughter.\u201dAnd the growing army of families of those lost to heroin \u2014 many of them in the suburbs and small towns \u2014 are now using their influence, anger and grief to cushion the country\u2019s approach to drugs, from altering the language around addiction to prodding government to treat it not as a crime, but as a disease.Mr. Botticelli, a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for 26 years, speaks to some of these parents regularly.Their efforts also include lobbying statehouses, holding rallies and starting nonprofit organizations, making these mothers and fathers part of a growing backlash against the harsh tactics of traditional drug enforcement. These days, in rare bipartisan or even nonpartisan agreement, punishment is out and compassion is in.The presidential candidates of both parties are now talking about the drug epidemic, with Hillary Rodham Clinton hosting forums on the issue as Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina tell their own stories of loss while calling for more care and empathy.And in one of the most striking shifts in this new era, some local police departments have stopped punishing many heroin users. In Gloucester, Mass., those who walk into the police station and ask for help, even if they are carrying drugs or needles, are no longer arrested. Instead, they are diverted to treatment, despite questions about the police departments\u2019 unilateral authority to do so. It is an approach being replicated by three dozen other police departments around the country.Still, he and other experts said, a broad consensus seems to be emerging: The drug problem will not be solved by arrests alone, but rather by treatment.Parents like the Griffins say that while they recognize the racial shift in heroin use, politicians and law enforcement are responding in this new way because \u201cthey realized what they were doing wasn\u2019t working.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re paying more attention because people are screaming about it,\u201d Mr. Griffin said. \u201cI work with 100 people every day \u2014 parents, people in recovery, addicts \u2014 who are invading the statehouse, doing everything we can to make as much noise as we can to try to save these kids.\u201dHeroin\u2019s spread into the suburbs and small towns grew out of an earlier wave of addiction to prescription painkillers; together the two trends are ravaging the country.Deaths from heroin rose to 8,260 in 2013, quadrupling since 2000 and aggravating what some were already calling the worst drug overdose epidemic in United States history.Here in New England, the epidemic has grabbed officials by the lapels.The old industrial cities, quiet small towns and rural outposts are seeing a near-daily parade of drug summit meetings, task forces, vigils against heroin, pronouncements from lawmakers and news media reports on the heroin crisis.New Hampshire is typical of the hardest-hit states. Last year, 325 people here died of opioid overdoses, a 68 percent increase from 2013. Potentially hundreds more deaths were averted by emergency medical workers, who last year administered naloxone, a medication that reverses the effects of opioid overdoses, in more than 1,900 cases.Adding to the anxiety among parents, the state also ranks second to last, ahead only of Texas, in access to treatment programs; New Hampshire has about 100,000 people in need of treatment, state officials say, but the state\u2019s publicly financed system can serve just 4 percent of them.Since New Hampshire holds the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, residents have repeatedly raised the issue of heroin with the 2016 candidates.A guide to the drug\u2019s spread and impact.She has also led discussions on the topic around the country, including packed forums like the one in Laconia, N.H., where hundreds of politically engaged, mostly white middle-class men and women, stayed for two hours in a sweltering meeting hall to talk and listen. One woman told of the difficulties of getting her son into a good treatment program, and said he eventually took his own life. Another told Mrs. Clinton of the searing pain of losing her beloved son to heroin.Many of the 15 Republican candidates for president have heard similar stories, and they are sharing their own.Some black scholars said they welcomed the shift, while expressing frustration that earlier calls by African-Americans for a more empathetic approach were largely ignored.\u201cThis new turn to a more compassionate view of those addicted to heroin is welcome,\u201d said Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw, who specializes in racial issues at Columbia and U.C.L.A. law schools. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cone cannot help notice that had this compassion existed for African-Americans caught up in addiction and the behaviors it produces, the devastating impact of mass incarceration upon entire communities would never have happened.\u201dAmong recent bills passed by the New Hampshire legislature in response is one that gives friends and family access to naloxone, the anti-overdose medication. Mr. Griffin, a few months after his daughter died, was among those testifying for the bill. It was set to pass in May but would not take effect until January 2016 \u2014 until Mr. Griffin warned lawmakers that too many lives could be lost in that six-month gap. At his urging, the bill was amended to take effect as soon as it was signed into law. It went into effect June 2.But today, with heroin ravaging largely white communities in the Northeast and Midwest, and with violent crime largely down, the mood is more forgiving.\u201cBoth the image and reality is that this is a white and often middle-class problem,\u201d said Mr. Mauer of the Sentencing Project. \u201cAnd appropriately so, we\u2019re having a much broader conversation about prevention and treatment, and trying to be constructive in responding to this problem. This is good. I don\u2019t think we should lock up white kids to show we\u2019re being equal.\u201dSo officers like Eric Adams, a white former undercover narcotics detective in Laconia, are finding new ways to respond. He is deployed full time now by the Police Department to reach out to people who have overdosed and help them get treatment.\u201cThe way I look at addiction now is completely different,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what changed inside of me, but these are people and they have a purpose in life and we can\u2019t as law enforcement look at them any other way. They are committing crimes to feed their addiction, plain and simple. They need help.\u201dOften working with the police, rather than against them, parents are driving these kinds of individual conversions.Their efforts include attempts to recast addiction in a less stigmatizing light \u2014 many parents along with treatment providers are avoiding words like \u201caddict\u201d or \u201cjunkie\u201d and instead using terms that convey a chronic illness, like \u201csubstance use disorder.\u201dFor Doug and Pam Griffin Courtney is still their focus; her pastel bedroom is as she left it, with the schedules of meetings of Narcotics Anonymous taped to what she called her \u201crecovery wall.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much given up what used to be our life,\u201d Mr. Griffin said.But in addition to grieving and testifying at hearings and forums, the Griffins take calls day and night from parents across the country who have read their story and want to offer an encouraging word or ask for advice. They are establishing a sober house, named after Courtney. And they host a potluck dinner and church service once a month on Sunday nights at the First Baptist Church in nearby Plaistow, where they held their daughter\u2019s funeral, for people with addictions and their families.At last month\u2019s service, more than 75 people filled the pews, including the family of Christopher Honor, who was Courtney\u2019s boyfriend. He was also addicted to heroin. Last month, almost a year after her death, Chris, 22, died of an overdose \u2014 the 23rd overdose and third fatal one this year in Plaistow, a town of 8,000 people.Chris\u2019s mother, Amanda Jordan, 40, wanted to attend the Sunday night service last month, but it was just two weeks after she had buried Chris, and she worried it might be too soon to go back to that church, where Chris\u2019s funeral was held. She sometimes thinks Chris is still alive, and at his funeral she was convinced he was still breathing.She was afraid she would fall apart, but she and other family members decided to go anyway. During the service, her son Brett, 18, became so overwhelmed with emotion that he had to leave, rushing down the center aisle for the outside. Ms. Jordan ran after him. Then a family friend, Shane Manning, ran after both of them. Outside, they all clutched one another and sobbed.\u201cI\u2019m a mess,\u201d Ms. Jordan said after coming back inside and kneeling in front of a picture of Chris. In addition to yearning for her son, she had been worried that the Griffins blamed her for Courtney\u2019s death. But at the church, they welcomed her. In their shared pain, the families spoke and embraced.Ms. Jordan, one of the more recent involuntary members of this club of shattered parents, said that someday, when she is better able to function, she \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants to work with the Griffins to \u201chelp New Hampshire realize there\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d Right now, though, she just wants to hunt down the person who sold Chris his fatal dose. \u201cThese dealers aren\u2019t just selling it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re murdering people.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article erroneously included one drug among the prescription opioids contributing to 44 deaths each day from overdoses. While OxyContin is a prescription opioid, heroin is not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oregon Shooting at Umpqua College Kills 10, Sheriff Says", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosROSEBURG, Ore. \u2014 A 26-year-old man opened fire on a community college campus here in a rampage that left 10 people dead and seven wounded and turned this rural stretch of southern Oregon into the latest American locale ravaged by a mass shooting.Students described scenes of carnage concentrated in a public speaking class that was underway in a college humanities building, and people fleeing in panic from classrooms as they heard shots nearby.The college, Umpqua Community College, went into lockdown, and the gunman died in an exchange of gunfire with police officers who responded, law enforcement officials said.With anxious parents waiting at a fairground near the campus and the police going from classroom to classroom, the authorities\u2019 reports of the death toll varied throughout the day. At a 5 p.m. news conference, John Hanlin, the sheriff of Douglas County, said that he believed there were 10 dead, calling the toll the \u201cbest, most accurate information we have at this time.\u201d He declined to say whether the gunman was included in the death toll.They said one witness had told them that Mr. Mercer had asked about people\u2019s religions before he began firing. \u201cHe appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,\u201d one law enforcement official said. Investigators are poring over what one official described as \u201chateful\u201d writings by Mr. Mercer. The F.B.I. has dispatched dozens of agents to assist in the investigation.Sheriff Hanlin said at a news conference that he would not speak the gunman\u2019s name.\u201cLet me be very clear, I will not name the shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.\u201dHe also encouraged reporters \u201cnot to glorify and create sensationalism for him. He in no way deserves it.\u201dThe massacre added the community college to a string of schools that have been left grieving after mass shootings, a list that runs from Columbine High School in 1999 to Virginia Tech in 2007 to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children were killed in 2012.President Obama, in an impassioned appearance at the White House, said that grief was not enough, and he implored Americans, \u201cwhether they are Democrats or Republicans or independents,\u201d to consider their representatives\u2019 stance on gun control when they voted and to decide \u201cwhether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor.\u201dState and local officials all expressed shock. Gov. Kate Brown said at a news conference that she felt \u201cprofound dismay and heartbreak.\u201dThe first reports of shots came at 10:38 a.m. on what was the fourth day of the new session. Students said they took place in Classroom 15 in a building called Snyder that houses many English and writing classes.Cassandra Welding, a 20-year-old junior, was in Classroom 16, next to the shooting, and heard several loud bursts, like balloons popping. There were about 20 people in the classroom. A middle-aged woman behind her rose to shut the classroom door and was struck in the stomach by several bullets.\u201cHe was just out there, hanging outside the door,\u201d Ms. Welding said of the gunman, \u201cand she slumped over and I knew something wasn\u2019t right. And they\u2019re like, \u2018She got shot, she got shot.\u2019 And everyone is panicking.\u201dA friend of the injured woman dragged her into the room and began delivering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. \u201cI heard more shooting,\u201d Ms. Welding said. \u201cIt was horrific. My whole body was shaking. A chill was going down my spine. We called 911.\u201dShe added, \u201cI was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.\u201dBrady Winder, 23, who moved to Roseburg only three weeks ago, was in a writing class.\u201cWe heard one shot,\u201d Mr. Winder said. \u201cIt sounded like someone dropped something heavy on the floor, and everybody kind of startled. There\u2019s a door connecting our classroom to that classroom, and my teacher was going to knock on the door, but she called out, \u2018Is everybody O.K.?\u2019 And then we heard a bunch more shots. We all froze for about half a second. Everybody\u2019s head turned and looked at each other, trying to just grasp what was happening, and someone said, \u2018Those are gunshots.\u2019 We heard people screaming next door. And then everybody took off. People were hopping over desks, knocking things over.\u201dKortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, told the Roseburg newspaper, The News-Review, that the gunman had asked people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing. She said she saw her teacher shot in the head, adding that she herself was on the floor with people who had been shot.Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining an online conversation on 4chan, an anonymous message board, as well as other social media, trying to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. In that conversation, one writer said, \u201cDon\u2019t go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.\u201dRoseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland, with a population of 22,000, is a part of the Pacific Northwest that in many ways has been left behind as the region has moved on toward an economy of technology and high wages. Once a major center for wood milling, it has struggled in recent decades as the timber harvests in the national forests that hug the community have declined.The college, with about 3,000 students, reflects that struggle, with many of its students coming back to school to gain skills for a career change. The average student is 37, and popular courses of study include winemaking, nursing, welding and auto mechanics. \u201cIt\u2019s a community college, so a lot of our friends and family attend this college,\u201d Sheriff Hanlin said.Joe Olson, who retired as president of Umpqua Community College at the end of June, said that within the past several months, the college had discussed hiring an armed security guard, but had ultimately decided against it.\u201cWe talked about that over the last year because we were concerned about safety on campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe campus was split 50-50. We thought we were a very safe campus, and having armed security officers on campus might change the culture.\u201dHe added, though, that he did not believe a security guard could prevent a gunman determined to kill.\u201cIf you want to come on the campus and you want to shoot five people, you are going to do that before our security would arrive,\u201d he said.Oregon is one of seven states with provisions, either from state legislation or court rulings, that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin.Numerous law enforcement agencies responded to Thursday\u2019s shooting. Corey Ray, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the agency was sending teams, including canine teams, from Seattle, Portland and Eugene, Ore. They will join a team already on the ground that is helping search for firearms casings and other ammunition.The apartment complex where the gunman had lived was roped off with police tape and under guard by deputies last night. Bronte Hart, 21, said she lived beneath Mr. Mercer, who she said would frequently shout at her for smoking on her balcony.\u201cHe yelled at us, me and my husband,\u201d said Ms. Hart, who lives in the complex with her husband and father. \u201cHe was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.\u201dMs. Hart and her father, Eli Loomas, said the authorities had shown up at the complex in the morning and begun asking questions about Mr. Mercer.Eight miles south of the college, at a cordoned-off hall on the Douglas County Fairgrounds, family members spent agonizing hours waiting to hear of possible victims as students were evacuated there.\u201cThe police searched everybody,\u201d Mr. Winder, one of the students, said, \u201csearching their jackets and bags for weapons before putting them on buses.\u201dAmong those waiting were Jessica Chandler, whose daughter, 18-year-old Rebecka Carnes, started classes at Umpqua on Monday. Her daughter, an aspiring dental hygienist, had not responded to dozens of calls. A friend told Ms. Chandler that the teenager had been taken to a hospital, but the police and hospital officials would not confirm it.A selection of President Obama\u2019s comments after mass shootings.\u201cShe always has her cellphone and is always in contact,\u201d Ms. Chandler said, smoking a cigarette outside the family waiting area. \u201cI want to know where my kid is.\u201dMany students at the school talked about tiny details that stuck with them as they ran, and how they had tried to piece together information as they hid and hoped to stay alive.Joanah Fallin was headed toward the campus around 10:30 a.m. when he saw a police car go by at what, he estimated, was 120 miles an hour. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any car go that fast,\u201d he said.By the time he reached campus, it was already in mayhem. \u201cLot of people were crying,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a woman with a child. It was just unbelievable.\u201dLuke Rogers, another student, was in the building next door to the shooting. He said he and his classmates were locked in the building from 10:30 a.m. until noon, with the only access to information about the shooting coming from texts from friends and family.\u201cWhen we exited the building, the officers made us put our hands above our heads and leave in a single-file line,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we passed Snyder hall, we saw the doors open, and on the ground there were drops of blood.\u201dDirk VanderHart reported from Roseburg, Kirk Johnson from Seattle and Julie Turkewitz from Denver. Reporting was contributed by Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Timothy Williams from New York, Claire Cain Miller from Roseburg, Ian Lovett from Los Angeles, Jack Healy from Denver, Michael S.

{"Headline": "Spread Out Risk in Your Portfolio by Company, Not Country", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you set out to build a diversified stock portfolio, should you emphasize assembling a broad mix of businesses or a broad mix of countries where the business is done?Recent research suggests that the first factor is more important because globalization has diminished the relevance of the second.The returns of stock markets vary, but to a large degree that is because of concentrations in different sectors, Morningstar\u2019s analysis showed. From 2000 through mid-2014, for instance, more than half the variability in dividend growth across markets in developed economies was because of the mix of sectors among them, the study found.It has become routine to buy exchange-traded funds that focus on regions or single countries to help diversify a portfolio. But that tactic may have the opposite effect by inadvertently providing excessive exposure to one sector or another.\u201cInvestors in country E.T.F.s need to be aware of the potential correlation between them due to similar sector weights,\u201d said Philip Straehl, the senior research consultant at Morningstar Investment Management who wrote the study. \u201cSince sectors are a key driver of corporate fundamentals across international stock markets, diversification across sectors needs to be a key consideration when constructing global stock portfolios.\u201dKim Arthur, chief executive of Main Management, a firm that runs portfolios comprising E.T.F.s, agreed that if you are going to invest abroad, \u201cyou had better know the sector exposure you\u2019re getting.\u201d He noted that technology has a dominant weighting in Taiwan, for instance, and that financial services are a substantial sector in Hong Kong.The risk of having lopsided exposure to a sector is somewhat diminished for Americans who invest internationally if they have a broad domestic portfolio to begin with, Mr. Straehl said. The American market is more diversified than others, he pointed out, and the size of the American economy ensures that companies derive more of their sales and profits from within the country than is true elsewhere.Having a broad mix of sectors is vital for achieving diversification. Going a step further and tweaking the mix, allocating more to some and less to others based on prevailing business and economic conditions, may help investors beat the market consistently, some advisers contend. That is true for domestic and international portfolios alike, they say.\u201cSector allocation is more important than trying to find that perfect international allocation,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, a business that provides asset management and financial advice. \u201cWhen energy is going up, energy companies everywhere are going up. Materials companies go up on rising commodity prices.\u201dFinancial services is one of several sectors that typically perform poorly toward the end of an economic upswing and bull market, a period when interest rates often climb, he said. Other weaker late-cycle sectors are utilities and consumer discretionary, the group that includes retailers, airlines and manufacturers of big-ticket items like washing machines and cars.Better bets in an aging bull market, he said, are health care and technology, where earnings can continue to grow as the economy is beginning to roll over. Once a bear market begins, health care and other defensive sectors, such as consumer staples and utilities, generally outperform.During the early phase of a recovery, stocks in those sectors are comparatively weak as investors gravitate toward alternatives that are more sensitive to growth, such as technology, financials and consumer discretionary.Investors can use sector E.T.F.s to play these trends, and a rapidly expanding number of asset management companies, such as Mr. Arthur\u2019s, do it for a living. Assets in sector-rotation E.T.F. managed portfolios totaled $20.2 billion at the end of last year, according to Morningstar, a date selected because several companies were slow in reporting more recent figures. Three years earlier, the total was $6.3 billion.The patterns that Mr. Stack highlighted, with certain sectors rising and falling with or contrary to economic and market cycles, have been observed across many bull and bear markets. But capitalizing on them can be problematic for several reasons, advisers caution.It is difficult to know with any precision where the economy and market are except in hindsight, although Mr. Stack contends that there are usually signposts that give investors a rough idea if they are keen enough to spot them. Lately the evidence suggests to him that the market has reached a crossroads.The economy seems to be humming along, but \u201cfrom a technical standpoint this market appears to be in trouble,\u201d he said. The ratio of rising stocks over decliners began deteriorating before the third-quarter swoon, as did the ratio of stocks hitting 52-week highs versus lows. As a result, he has been \u201cshifting to defensive sectors, ones that do best in the last year of a bull market,\u201d he said, such as health care, and limiting exposure to financials and consumer discretionary.Another tricky aspect of sector investing is putting companies in the right boxes. Take Amazon.com and Netflix, two leading technology stocks that are not uniformly categorized as technology stocks by all analysts. The first is a retailer and the second provides entertainment, making them consumer discretionary companies, as Standard & Poor\u2019s reasons. The presence of such large, de facto technology companies could explain why consumer discretionary, a late-cycle sector, has continued to perform well.Another impediment to playing sectors profitably is that sometimes investors are all too aware of where they are in the cycle and pay too much to be in the right place at the right time, said Jan Erik Warneryd, senior portfolio manager of Hillswick Asset Management, another firm that runs E.T.F. managed portfolios.When history suggests that a particular sector should excel, it often turns out that \u201cpeople have already positioned themselves for it,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe want to do things that other people aren\u2019t doing.\u201dBased on the most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, published in mid-September, other people have had heavy allocations to consumer discretionary, bank and technology sectors. Managers have been light on materials and especially energy.Mr. Warneryd\u2019s largest positions are in telecommunications, health care and utilities, with a more modest overweighting in financials. His portfolio has a relatively light consumer discretionary weighting because it has \u201cthe richest valuation of any sector,\u201d he said. Contrary to his contrarian ambitions, his smallest holding is in energy.Mr. Arthur says he also is concerned about consumer discretionary valuations, and he finds telecoms overvalued, but he is more hopeful about energy. He notes that the average dividend yield on energy stocks, about 3 percent, is substantially higher than the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, recently 2 percent, a rare development after a prolonged decline in energy.\u201cWe have been stepping into it, but we could be stepping on a land mine,\u201d Mr. Arthur acknowledged, referring to energy. \u201cThat\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel with these things. Being early is a lot like being wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Few in Venezuela Want Bol\u00edvars, but No One Can Spare a Dime", "Date": "2015-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen robbers carjacked Pedro Venero, an engineer, earlier this year, he expected they would drive him to his bank to cash his check for a hefty sum in bol\u00edvars \u2014 the sort of thing that crime-weary Venezuelans have long since gotten used to. But the robbers, armed with rifles and a grenade, and sure that he would have a stash of dollars at home, wanted nothing to do with the bol\u00edvars in his bank account.\u201cThey told me straight up, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about that,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Venero said. \u201cForget about it.\u201dThe eagerness to dump bol\u00edvars or avoid them completely shows the extent to which Venezuelans have lost faith in their economy and in the ability of their government to find a way out of the mess.A year ago, $1 bought about 100 bol\u00edvars on the black market. These days, it often fetches more than 700 bol\u00edvars, a sign of how thoroughly domestic confidence in the economy has crashed.The International Monetary Fund has predicted that inflation in Venezuela will hit 159 percent this year (though President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said it will be half that), and that the economy will shrink 10 percent, the worst projected performance in the world (though there was no estimate for war-torn Syria).That would be a disastrous drive off the cliff for a country that sits on the world\u2019s largest estimated oil reserves and has long considered itself rich in contrast to many of its neighbors.Yet the real story goes beyond numbers, revealed in the absurdities of life in a country where the government has refused for months to release basic economic data like the inflation rate or the gross domestic product.Even as the country\u2019s income has shrunk with the collapsing price of oil \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s only significant export \u2014 and the black market for dollars has soared, the government has insisted on keeping the country\u2019s principal exchange rate frozen at 6.3 bol\u00edvars to the dollar.That astonishing disparity makes for a sticker-shock economy in which it can be hard to be sure what anything is really worth, and in which the black-market dollar increasingly dictates prices.A movie ticket costs about 380 bol\u00edvars. Calculated at the government rate, that is $60. At the black-market rate, it is just 54 cents. Want a large popcorn and soda with that? Depending on how you calculate it, that is either $1.15 or $128.The minimum wage is 7,421 bol\u00edvars a month. That is either a decent $1,178 a month or a miserable $10.60.Either way, it does not go far enough. According to the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis of the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers, a month\u2019s worth of food for a family of five cost 50,625 bol\u00edvars in August, more than six times the minimum monthly wage and more than three times what it cost in the same month a year earlier.Dinner for two at one of this city\u2019s better restaurants can cost 30,000 bol\u00edvars. That is $42.85 at the black-market rate or $4,762 at the official exchange rate.A gallon of white paint cost almost 6,000 bol\u00edvars on a recent Tuesday. At the same store on the following Friday, it cost more than 12,000 bol\u00edvars.With crucial legislative elections scheduled in December, the government has begun to make refrigerators, air-conditioners and household appliances available to government workers and the party faithful at rock-bottom prices. One government worker said he had bought a Chinese-made 48-inch plasma television for 11,000 bol\u00edvars, or just $15.71 at the black-market exchange rate.Mr. Maduro blames an \u201ceconomic war\u201d waged by his enemies, foreign and domestic, for the problems. But most economists say the problems are caused by the fall in oil prices and the government\u2019s policies, including strict controls on prices and foreign exchange for imports.As the crisis has unfolded, Mr. Maduro has hesitated to make changes even top officials say are needed, like raising the price of gasoline, which is so heavily subsidized that it is virtually free \u2014 perhaps because he is fearful of a backlash before the elections.Things get stranger by the day.Need a new car battery? Bring a pillow, because you will have to sleep overnight in your car outside the shop. On a recent night, more than 80 cars were lined up.Want a new career? Plenty of Venezuelans have quit their jobs to sell basic goods like disposable diapers or corn flour on the black market, tripling or quadrupling their salary in the process.Need cash? O.K., but not too much. Some A.T.M.s limit withdrawals to the black-market equivalent of about 50 cents.Given the chronic shortages of basic goods, supermarkets and pharmacies fill long rows of shelves with a single product. One store recently had both sides of an aisle lined with packages of salt. Another did the same thing with vinegar. A pharmacy had row after row of cotton swabs.But among all the shortages here, one of the most notable is a shortage of paper money, especially the coffee-colored 100-bol\u00edvar notes that are the largest in general circulation (black-market value, about 14 cents) and feature a portrait of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.\u201cYou want to understand why there\u2019s a lot of money and there\u2019s no money?\u201d Ruth de Krivoy, a former Central Bank president, asked with a rueful laugh. She said the main problem was that the government had failed to respond to rapidly rising prices by issuing larger-denomination bills, like a 1,000- or 10,000-bol\u00edvar note. So people need many more bills to buy the same goods they bought a year ago.Also, as people resort to the black market to buy more goods that cannot be found in stores, transactions that could once be made with debit or credit cards are now conducted with cash. That creates logistical problems, as banks must move around huge amounts of paper money and A.T.M.s empty out more quickly.Mr. Maduro is certainly aware of the symbolic impact of issuing larger bills with more zeros \u2014 and the inevitable comparison it would strike with his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2008, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez issued new bills and knocked off three zeros from a currency that had long suffered from devaluation and inflation, renaming it the strong bol\u00edvar.Today, the bol\u00edvar is anything but strong.The other day, Jaime Bello, an airline mechanic, visited his bank, the government-run Banco del Tesoro, only to find that its three cash machines were out of money. He recalled an earlier visit when he went to withdraw 2,000 bol\u00edvars and stood listening to the whirring sound as the machine spit out a great stack of 5-bol\u00edvar notes, each worth less than an American penny. He pulled out the stack of 200 bills and then waited while the machine counted out 200 more.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re living a nightmare. There\u2019s nothing to buy, and the money isn\u2019t worth anything.\u201dThe crisis has also meant opportunity for those willing to stand in long lines to buy cheap government-regulated goods that they can resell at a profit.\u201cI said to myself, \u2018I can make more doing this,\u2019 and I quit my job at the hair salon,\u201d said Geraldine Cassiani, who left her job as a manicurist in February for a career on the black market. She said she now earned four to five times what she had before.On a recent trip to the supermarket, she used contacts at the store to skip the line outside and bought four packages of disposable diapers, even though shoppers were limited to two each. Ms. Cassiani already had a \u201cclient\u201d lined up to buy the diapers for almost three times what she paid: a nurse who could not take time off to stand in line.Mr. Maduro regularly goes on television to denounce black marketeers and to blame them for shortages and high prices.\u201cPartly, I think that what I\u2019m doing is bad,\u201d Ms. Cassiani said, adding that she raised prices less than some black marketeers. A single mother, she said she had to provide for her child.\u201cNecessity has a dog\u2019s face,\u201d she said.Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The tone is not improved by Ms. Klein\u2019s super-sweet narration, which, in trying to avoid hectoring, too often coats complex issues in a deceptive simplicity.But Ms. Klein can hardly be blamed for the difficulty of condensing her prodigious and wide-ranging research into 89 minutes. Nor can the director, Avi Lewis (who spent four years filming in nine countries), be chastised for highlighting the uplift that Ms. Klein finds as she pokes around the globe. It\u2019s not easy to describe a systemic plundering of resources, and identify the culprit as global capitalism, without losing your train of thought or your cool, and the movie accomplishes this by focusing on the cheering reactions of the victims \u2014 in this case, a bottom-up environmentalism of regular folks fighting irregular circumstances.Moving, humane and unfailingly polite, \u201cThis Changes Everything\u201d presents a Panglossian view of approaching disaster that (according to the film\u2019s publicity notes) seeks to empower rather than to scare.

{"Headline": "Republican Candidates Take Sharp Tone in Third Debate", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Marco Rubio of Florida coolly rebuffed attacks from his onetime mentor, Jeb Bush, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas emerged as a champion of social conservatives at Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, as both men found their voices after months of lower-key performances.Testiness and sharpened jabs infused the night as struggling candidates like Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio ripped into their less experienced rivals and tried to portray them as unqualified for the White House.The free-for-all of verbal assaults reflected the new volatility in a race that Donald J. Trump dominated for months. It appears to be shifting in favor of candidates like Mr. Rubio and Ben Carson as the first nominating contests near and voters start paying closer attention to the field. Mr. Rubio, a first-term senator, had the best night of his campaign, showing the political talent that many insiders had long seen in him. He and Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon now leading in several polls, faced the toughest questions but emerged largely unscathed, with Mr. Rubio in particular winning strong applause from the audience at the University of Colorado Boulder for his confident performance and deft counterpunches.Mr. Bush, under great pressure to have a strong debate that would reassure his supporters and change the trajectory of his struggling campaign, had another lackluster night, raising the possibility that uncommitted donors will write him off and embrace candidates like Mr. Rubio.Frustration permeated the Bush camp: Danny Diaz, Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters that he had complained to CNBC, the cable network hosting the debate, that Mr. Bush was receiving too few questions from the moderators.Mr. Kasich made a strong impression by showing new aggressiveness from the debate\u2019s first moments, taking on Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson in hopes of improving his dismal standing in voter surveys. Mr. Trump, bent on recapturing his lead in the polls from Mr. Carson, was more restrained in his mockery of his rivals than in the previous two debates, and even faded into the background for long stretches.It was a night that saw a reversal of fortunes: Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush have been in the campaign spotlight for months as they jousted with each other and asserted their financial dominance in the race, but both were overshadowed Wednesday by the commanding performances of Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz.Mr. Rubio, an ally of Mr. Bush when he was governor of Florida and Mr. Rubio was the State House speaker, found himself under sharp attack over his reputation for chronic absenteeism in Washington. Mr. Rubio has missed more votes than any other senator this year. Mr. Bush, who has fared poorly with voters despite months of campaigning and heavy spending, blasted Mr. Rubio over his work ethic \u2014 a striking moment in the ongoing fraying of their friendship as they compete for support from moderate Republicans in Florida.\u201cMarco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term \u2014 you should be showing up to work,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cI mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek? You get like three days where you have to show up?\u201dMr. Rubio hit back forcefully, noting that Mr. Bush has said he is modeling his campaign after Senator John McCain\u2019s in 2008, and that Mr. McCain missed many votes in the chamber during that run. And he attributed the criticism to the fact that Mr. Bush is struggling in the polls.\u201cThe only reason you\u2019re doing it now is because we\u2019re running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Cruz also stood out far more than he had in the first two debates, reminding viewers of his fights against Republican leaders and blistering the news media in a fashion that delighted the crowd. He made a strong case for why he could emerge as the candidate of choice for evangelical voters, a vital Republican bloc.\u201cMy mom, who\u2019s here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cNow, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again, and he came back to my mom and me, and we were raised together. But I \u2014 the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.\u201dMr. Bush, whose mild-mannered, pragmatic persona and family lineage have turned off many voters, drew little applause as he dwelled mostly on policy and did little to undercut his chief antagonist in the race, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly belittled him. He did not directly take on Mr. Trump, saying obliquely and in somewhat rambling language, \u201cIt troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never been that way in American politics before,\u201d Mr. Bush continued. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that this country\u2019s days are going to be deeply \u2014 you know, going down. I think we\u2019re on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.\u201dMr. Bush receded after his unsuccessful skirmish with Mr. Rubio, failing to turn in the sort of bravura performance his supporters had hoped for.Even when Mr. Bush boasted lightheartedly about his undefeated fantasy football record this year, the line was hurled back in his face. \u201cWe have $19 trillion in debt, we have people out of work, we have ISIS and Al Qaeda attacking us, and we\u2019re talking about fantasy football?\u201d Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey demanded, turning his fire on Mr. Bush and the moderators, who had asked about regulation of the fantasy sports industry.While the debate was ostensibly dedicated to the economy, the fluid dynamics of the Republican race \u2014 with new polls showing Mr. Carson in the lead in Iowa and nationally, and Mr. Trump and especially Mr. Bush in decline \u2014 drove the candidates to seek moments that would emphasize their credibility and electability and resonate with conservative voters who are dissatisfied with Washington and politics as usual.Mr. Kasich was more impassioned than Mr. Bush in his attacks, which began when Mr. Kasich ignored the debate\u2019s first question, about each candidate\u2019s weaknesses. Instead, he made implicit criticisms of Mr. Trump and other Republicans as unprepared for the presidency or wrongheaded on issues, referring, for example, to Mr. Trump\u2019s strong support for deporting unauthorized immigrants.\u201cMy great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cWe need somebody who can lead.\u201dMr. Trump ripped into Mr. Kasich for turning negative against his rivals. \u201cHe was such a nice guy, and he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m never going to attack,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut then his poll numbers tanked. He has got \u2014 that is why he is on the end,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Kasich\u2019s placement on the debate stage. \u201cAnd he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.\u201d Several candidates faced tough questioning about their financial policies. Mr. Carson defended his plan to radically overhaul the tax system: He has said he would take inspiration from God and push for a \u201cproportional tax system\u201d based on tithing, in which people would pay the same percentage \u2014 close to 15 percent \u2014 of income in taxes, while deductions and loopholes would be eliminated.When a moderator insisted that his plan would leave the government with a trillion-dollar revenue hole, Mr. Carson pushed back.\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt works out very well.\u201dMr. Kasich was quick to dispute Mr. Carson. \u201cThis is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning,\u201d he said of Mr. Carson\u2019s tax ideas. \u201cThese plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.\u201dNearly everyone onstage at Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate had an achievable mission, including CNBC, which stood to gain by reaching a big prime-time audience with a major newsmaking event. Here\u2019s a look at how well they did.Mr. Rubio seemed to get the better of Mr. Bush again when they discussed their own economic plans in close succession. While Mr. Bush spoke wonkishly of \u201cthe code\u201d and \u201cregulatory cost,\u201d Mr. Rubio cast the issue in personal terms, talking about how a tax overhaul would affect \u201cthe guy that does my dry cleaning.\u201dMr. Rubio also faced questions about money \u2014 in his case, about his management of his personal finances: He has acknowledged mistakes such as using personal credit cards to pay for his campaigns, and using a Florida Republican Party credit card to pay for a paving project at his home and for travel to a family reunion. He responded by implicitly swiping at Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump, who benefited from being the scions of wealthy fathers.\u201cI didn\u2019t inherit any money \u2014 my dad was a bartender and my mother was a maid,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about my finances; I\u2019m worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good-paying jobs.\u201dAgain and again, Mr. Rubio repelled attacks from his opponents and difficult questions from the moderators with ready responses that turned issues back on his interlocutors and prompted loud applause from the crowd.He defended himself by attacking a Florida newspaper that had called for his resignation on Wednesday \u2014 and, more broadly, by castigating the news media, a favorite target of Republicans.Mr. Cruz picked up where Mr. Rubio left off and won his own round of booming applause for attacking the CNBC moderators, saying they were focused on provoking fights rather than examining policy issues.\u201cThis is not a cage match. And you look at the questions \u2014 Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? John Kasich, will you insult two people over here? Marco Rubio, why don\u2019t you resign? Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHow about talking about the substantive issues people care about?\u201dMr. Rubio appealed to the audience not only with his attacks on the news media, but also by taking aim at Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate.\u201cIt was the week she got exposed as a liar,\u201d he said, referring to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s testimony last Thursday before a congressional panel investigating the 2012 attacks on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya.Another candidate, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief, who benefited from her debate showing last month, did not make the same impact on Wednesday. She echoed Mr. Rubio\u2019s comments about Mrs. Clinton in her concluding statement, looking into the camera and telling viewers: \u201cIn your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Carly Fiorina and Hillary Clinton.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with the continuation of an article about the Republican presidential debate misidentified, in some editions, the candidates shown. The photograph included, from left, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Rand Paul; the picture did not show John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio.Patrick Healy reported from New York, and Jonathan Martin from Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slowdown Continues for China in Factories", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The slump in China\u2019s sprawling manufacturing sector continued to worsen in September, data released on Thursday showed, the latest sign that the country\u2019s economic slowdown appears to be sharpening. Manufacturing output, as measured by the official purchasing managers index was 49.8 points in September, compared with a reading of 49.7 in August. The survey measures the change in conditions from the previous month; readings below 50 signal a contraction.The results of another survey, compiled by Caixin, a Chinese financial news company, and Markit, an economic data provider, suggested an even steeper contraction. The Caixin manufacturing P.M.I., also released Thursday, was 47.2 in September, down slightly from 47.3 in August and the lowest reading since the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009.\u201cThe industry has reached a crucial stage in its structural transformation,\u201d He Fan, the chief economist at the Caixin Insight Group, said in a statement accompanying the data release. \u201cTepid demand is a main factor behind the oversupply of manufacturing and why it has not recovered.\u201dChina\u2019s economic growth has been battered in recent months by a falloff in housing construction and a huge oversupply in certain sectors, like steel and cement, that has idled plants or seen them operate at a loss.At the same time, lackluster demand in key export markets in Asia and the West has combined with a broad slump in trade and investment in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia or Turkey to weigh further on China\u2019s economic prospects.On Monday, official figures showed profits at China\u2019s larger industrial firms contracted 8.8 percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest drop since the state statistics agency began releasing monthly data in 2011. Profit fell 22 percent at automakers and 72 percent at oil and gas firms.The statistics agency said industrial profits had been negatively affected by China\u2019s surprise decision on Aug. 11 to devalue its currency, the renminbi, by the most in nearly two decades.Such a move could benefit exporters, making China\u2019s goods relatively cheaper for overseas buyers. But it also makes imported materials more expensive for Chinese industrial companies.While questions over China\u2019s economic data are not new, many economists now doubt the country will be able to reach its official target for economic growth of 7 percent this year, despite having reported achieving that rate in the first six months of the year.Officials had hoped that consumer demand and the rise of a vibrant services sector would help offset the industrial slowdown and become the economy\u2019s main engines of growth.Separate services P.M.I. surveys released on Thursday showed that the sector continued to expand in September, but that growth, too, faces pressures. The official nonmanufacturing survey result was 53.4 points, unchanged from August. The Caixin services P.M.I. reading was 50.5, down from 51.5 in August and a 14-month low.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Save Iraq, Arm the Kurds", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsMore than a year after the so-called Islamic State overran Mosul and threatened Baghdad, the United States still can\u2019t rely on the Iraqi Army to defeat the jihadist forces. If President Obama wants to break the Islamic State in Iraq and give that country a chance to survive, he needs to help organize and equip a true Kurdish army.Until now, Mr. Obama has refused substantial aid to the Kurds because of the State Department\u2019s \u201cOne Iraq\u201d policy. Washington fears that a strong Kurdistan could end up fighting the Iraqi Army for disputed territory or declaring independence, upending United States policy and pitting Turkey against the new state.In the meantime, the Islamic State has made the \u201cOne Iraq\u201d policy obsolete. The jihadists now control close to a third of Iraq. And although Iraqi forces are showing more willingness to fight than they did when they fled Ramadi in May, they are still struggling to regain territory from the Islamic State. By contrast, the pesh merga, the Kurdish fighters, have successfully forced a broad Islamic State retreat at the cost of 1,500 Kurds killed in action and over 7,000 wounded. The Islamic State, clearly worried by the pesh merga, has responded with chemical weapons.The Kurdish gains are remarkable given the lack of American support. The United States and its allies have provided the Kurds with obsolete rifles, a few dozen armored vehicles and no tanks. One excuse for refusing to supply Kurdistan with advanced weaponry is that Kurdish fighters haven\u2019t undergone sufficient basic training yet. Meanwhile, the Islamic State, with no formal instruction, operates hundreds of sophisticated weapons that it seized from the Iraqi Army. The Kurds now find that the easiest way to get their hands on quality American equipment is to capture it from the Islamic State.Added to the lack of weapons is insufficient funds. Many pesh merga fight only part time because their salaries are low and paid infrequently. This saps morale and effectiveness. As one high-ranking official in the Ministry of Pesh Merga Affairs in Erbil explained, \u201cIf they stay on the front line for a whole month, they can\u2019t even feed their families.\u201dKurdish politics also hold back the pesh merga. Iraqi Kurdistan\u2019s two main political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, fought a civil war in the 1990s and divided the region into two governments. Although the parties reunited their administrations in 2006, the result has been a tense power-sharing arrangement with long quarrels over any transition of power. At present, for example, President Massoud Barzani is refusing to leave office, even though his term ended on Aug. 20.Worse, the two parties exercise a divided influence over many pesh merga. Although they have created unified K.D.P. and P.U.K. brigades, these units largely function jointly only on paper. When the fighting starts, one experienced officer remarked, the P.U.K. and K.D.P. soldiers often answer to separate commanders.If American policy wants to be truly effective, it should do more than just give a few weapons and limited training. Instead, the United States must help Kurdistan to organize, train and equip a nonpolitical Kurdish army. The United States can do this by greatly increasing its support to the Ministry of Pesh Merga Affairs\u2019 program dedicated to building nonpartisan units. The program requires that new recruits join the nonpolitical units as individuals, not party members. The ministry has managed to raise one nonparty brigade, and needs additional support to increase the number of units.The United States can turn these nonparty brigades into the nucleus of a new Kurdish army by providing the necessary weapons and training to make them effective, which will in turn encourage further recruitment. An American-assisted Kurdish army could make Kurdistan more stable by depriving politicians of control over military units. And a politically independent army reduces the risk of the K.D.P. and P.U.K. turning their guns against each other again. Furthermore, American involvement in the Kurdish army would keep the Kurds focused on the Islamic State rather than any domestic agenda.Turkey should not be a problem. Although it is currently fighting its own Kurdish population, it has close relations with the Iraqi Kurds. And though Turkey would have much to gain from a stable Kurdistan \u2014 indeed, Turkey has strong commercial and security ties with the Iraqi Kurds \u2014 the United States should make support for an Iraqi Kurdish army conditional on no bid for independence.In any event, Iraqi Kurdish leaders are in no rush to seek independence. The Islamic State threat is a brutal reminder of the dangers of going it alone. The local economy is weak, Kurdistan is overwhelmed with refugees and its neighbors will not tolerate its separation from Iraq.Given what the Kurds have already achieved with so little, a properly trained and equipped Kurdish army would likely inflict significant damage on the Islamic State. This would prevent the Islamic State from entrenching its control over northwestern Iraq and relieve pressure on the Iraqi government. Crucially, that should provide Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq with the breathing space he needs to reform and properly rebuild his own forces.With Russian military intervention in the Middle East growing, President Obama needs to strengthen his Kurdish ally, which has demonstrated an authentic commitment to the anti-Islamic State campaign in Iraq. A Kurdish army able to fight the Islamic State more seriously is the only way to achieve victory without sending American soldiers back to the battlefield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadly Ankara Attack Not Enough to Unify a Polarized Turkey", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, though usually a dominating presence in public life, issued only a short statement and did not make a speech.Instead of jubilation, a debate erupted on social media about whether he is truly Turkish, given that he is a distant relative of a lawmaker in the Kurdish party and was born in the Kurdish-dominated southeast. In an interview with the BBC, Dr. Sancar said: \u201cI do not speak Kurdish. I am Turkish. That\u2019s it.\u201dNothing seems to be enough to bring Turks together these days, even for a shared moment of grief or triumph. And the recent reactions reflect a deepening feeling that the country has become dangerously polarized.\u201cThis is the most fatal terror attack on Turkey in its history, and the fact that we cannot come together as a country at the moment and mourn for the loss of our citizens is deeply saddening,\u201d said Ziya Meral, a Turkish academic who lives in London.Within hours of the attack on Saturday outside the train station in Ankara, the capital, where two suicide bombers killed nearly 100 people, political leaders engaged in more bickering than consolation, and angry citizens began protesting against the government.After the attack, which struck a peace rally organized by Kurdish and leftist groups, the Kurdish political leader Selahattin Demirtas squarely blamed the government for the violence, in comments later criticized even by those who view the government unfavorably. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, at a nationally televised news conference, appealed to national unity but bashed his political opponents, and was criticized for showing little empathy.Analysts explain the lack of unity in Turkey, even in the face of such a tragedy, as a result of the increasingly divisive leadership of Mr. Erdogan and his Islamist Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., which has governed for 13 years.Turkey has long been divided by a number of fault lines \u2014 secular and religious, rich and poor, Turks and Kurds \u2014 and at one time Mr. Erdogan seemed capable of resolving those tensions. He sought peace with the Kurds, empowered the formerly oppressed religious masses and presided, for a time, over a robust economy.In recent years, though, that has all been reversed, as Mr. Erdogan has alienated many of his former supporters. His government has jailed journalists, chased businessmen with politically motivated tax investigations and cracked down on peaceful protesters. \u201cToday, so deep is the rift between the pro-government and anti-government sides that it cannot be bridged anymore, not even in celebration or grief,\u201d said Elif Shafak, the prominent Turkish novelist.Analysts say the political environment now, before snap parliamentary elections scheduled for Nov. 1, is the most combustible they have seen. In recent weeks, the government has cracked down on the Kurdish political movement, which did well in elections in June, and has increased pressure on journalists.\u201cTurkey is so deeply polarized after 13 years of A.K.P. rule,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, a Turkish analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Once so optimistic about Turkey\u2019s future that he wrote a book, published last year, called \u201cThe Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century\u2019s First Muslim Power,\u201d he now fears the country is \u201cabout to come apart at the seams.\u201dAfter more than a decade as prime minister, last year Mr. Erdogan rose to the presidency, once a largely ceremonial position that he has used to remain the country\u2019s pre-eminent political figure.If anything, the job of the president is to be above the political fray. But analysts said he had become too divisive a figure to try to comfort a country in the immediate aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack.\u201cRight now it would be the job of the president to rise to be a statesman and console the nation,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said. \u201cPresident Erdogan is nowhere to be seen.\u201dThe bombs that tore through a peace rally in Ankara on Saturday roiled a complex political landscape, rived by ideology, ethnicity and bitter conflict that spills across borders. A look at the parties and player struggling for power.Turkey faces a number of substantive security threats \u2014 from the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group that controls areas of Syria and Iraq; the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has waged an insurgency within Turkey for decades; and Marxist militants who were active during the Cold War and still are today.But as the reaction from all segments of society in the aftermath of the Ankara bombing demonstrated, Turkey is also largely at war with itself.Ahmet Hakan, a prominent columnist with the Turkish daily Hurriyet who has been critical of the government, was beaten up outside his home recently by a group of men, three of whom were determined to be members of the governing party.Mr. Hakan, who suffered a broken nose and broken ribs, wrote in a column published Monday that the government\u2019s polarizing and demonizing language \u201chas made this country a country of those who hate each other.\u201dMr. Davutoglu, in an interview on Monday with NTV, a private television channel, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was the \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the bombing. Even if the Islamic State is determined to be the culprit, it is unlikely to result in a sense of shared purpose in the fight against terrorism; the Kurds \u2014 the primary victims of Saturday\u2019s attack \u2014 have long blamed the Turkish government for enabling the rise of the Islamic State by supporting rebel groups fighting against the Syrian government.According to The Associated Press, the deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, told reporters on Monday that two suicide bombers had each exploded 11 pounds of TNT. He added that the authorities had detained \u201ca large number of suspects\u201d but refused to provide a figure, The A.P. reported. On political issues, one of the sharpest divides in Turkey is on foreign policy and the government\u2019s involvement in Syria. Many saw the terrorist attack as evidence of spillover from the conflict in Syria. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, an opposition politician who leads Turkey\u2019s main secular party, placed blame for the violence on the government\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in Middle Eastern affairs.\u201dAs if to underscore the depth of Turkish involvement in the Syrian civil war, a prominent Islamist rebel group in Syria that has close ties to Turkey, Jaysh al-Islam, issued a statement on Sunday offering condolences in the wake of the attacks.

One legislator, Ibrahim al-Zughaid, told a local television channel that representatives had reached a consensus not to accept the deal.But Fathi Bashagha, a senior negotiator in the peace talks, said that a small group of lawmakers led by the speaker had tried to impose their will on the rest to reject the peace agreement.

{"Headline": "New Limit for Smog-Causing Emissions Isn\u2019t as Strict as Many Had Expected", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Thursday unveiled a major new regulation on smog-causing emissions that spew from smokestacks and tailpipes, significantly tightening the current Bush-era standards but falling short of more stringent regulations that public health advocates and environmentalists had urged.Even so, the E.P.A. estimated that the annual cost to the economy would be $1.4 billion, making it one of the most expensive regulations in history. But it said those costs would be vastly outweighed by annual economic benefits of $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion because of fewer premature deaths, missed days of school and work, asthma attacks and emergency room visits.Depending on the severity of their ozone problem, states and counties will have from 2020 to 2037 to meet the standards. Business opponents of the regulations will almost certainly sue to delay or stop them.The agency\u2019s scientific panel had recommended a new standard of 60 to 70 parts per billion, and last year, the administration released a draft proposal that would have lowered the standard to a range of 65 to 70 parts per billion. Administration officials had sought public comment on a 60-parts-per-billion plan, keeping open the possibility that the final rule could be even stricter. In President Obama\u2019s first term, the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, recommended a rule of 65 parts per billion.Over the past year, the nation\u2019s business and manufacturing lobbies, including the Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable and American Petroleum Institute, have waged an all-fronts campaign to persuade the Obama administration to make the new standard as weak as possible. The groups were joined by dozens of mayors and local lawmakers, including many Democrats, who, in letters to the E.P.A. and the White House, said that a strict new ozone rule could lead to the closing of factories and power plants across the country.Some Democratic governors had also urged the administration to put forth a weaker rule. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia told the White House that he would like to see the looser 70-parts-per-billion standard. Labor groups such as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers asked the White House to keep the standard at the 75-parts-per-billion level.The new rule, set at the weakest standard in the range recommended by the E.P.A.\u2019s scientists, suggests that the industry groups were influential.The current E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy, who served as Ms. Jackson\u2019s assistant administrator when she drafted a standard of 65 parts per million, said that lobbying and political concerns had no impact on her decision.\u201cOur job is to set science-backed standards that protect the health of the American people,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action is one of the most important measures we can take for improving public health, reducing the costs of illness and protecting our children\u2019s health.\u201dAsked why she had settled on a significantly weaker standard than the one recommended by her former boss, Ms. McCarthy replied, \u201cWith apologies to Lisa Jackson, there\u2019s a lot more health data available today than she had available.\u201d\u201cWe have 1,000 more studies that were not available to her,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of those studies gave us a lot more information. And we decided 70 was the standard based on the science that was available. To me, this is a significant step forward, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s not based on anything except science and the law.\u201dIn preparing the standard, E.P.A. officials said, the agency examined nearly 2,300 scientific studies, considered more than 430,000 public comments and held three public hearings.The industry lobbies said they were disappointed that the standard had been tightened at all, but pleased that the new rule was the least stringent of the options on the table.\u201cToday, the Obama administration finalized a rule that is overly burdensome, costly and misguided,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cFor months, the administration threatened to impose on manufacturers an even harsher rule, with even more devastating consequences. After an unprecedented level of outreach by manufacturers and other stakeholders, the worst-case scenario was avoided.\u201dThe new rules will still require the owners of factories and power plants to install costly \u201cscrubber\u201d technology on their smokestacks, designed to clean out the polluting chemicals. Each scrubber can cost tens of millions of dollars.The weaker rule did not appease Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican critics.\u201cNationwide, it could lead to massive job loss and cost tens of billions annually in lost economic growth,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. \u201cNo wonder we\u2019ve seen even the Obama administration\u2019s traditional union allies fret publicly about \u2018the detrimental impact\u2019 these \u2018extreme requirements\u2019 would have on American jobs and the American economy.\u201dBut environmental advocates still saw the new rule as a blow.\u201cDisappointing is too mild a term,\u201d said Frank O\u2019Donnell, president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch. \u201cThe big polluters won this time, for the most part,\u201d he added. \u201cThis decision will tarnish the president\u2019s environmental legacy. The national clean air standards are the heart of the Clean Air Act. This decision is heart failure.\u201dAlthough environmentalists have praised Mr. Obama for many of his environmental policies, the efforts to control smog have long been a sore spot for them.The E.P.A. had planned to release the new ozone rule in August 2011, when Ms. Jackson intended to issue the stringent rule of 65 parts per billion. Ms. Jackson, whose son has asthma, saw the smog rule as a centerpiece of her own environmental legacy.At the time, Mr. Obama said the regulation would impose too severe a burden on industry and local governments at a time of economic distress. Ms. Jackson nearly resigned over the issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau Is Expected to Set a Pragmatic, Not Partisan, Course in Canada", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince becoming leader of the Liberal Party two years ago, Mr. Trudeau, 43, has repeatedly emphasized that he wants politics to be about consensus, not ideology. That would be a shift from the hyperpartisan approach of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who has led Canada for nearly 10 years.But when he takes office on Nov. 4, he will find himself saddled with a problem that most elected officials would give anything for: a majority in Parliament. He should be able to pass his left-leaning agenda with little friction, yet that would probably alienate the very conservatives he has said he wants to reach out to.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s associates insist that he is pragmatic above all. \u201cHe\u2019s committed to try to make the right decision and not always ideological decisions,\u201d said Anna Gainey, the president of the Liberal Party and a longtime friend of Mr. Trudeau.To those who question his sincerity to consult widely on policy, she said, \u201cThere is always going to be cynicism and criticism no matter whether you\u2019re left or right or up or down.\u201d\u201cA whole lot of what people wanted was a change in style,\u201d said a former senior bureaucrat who did not want to be identified talking publicly about the government\u2019s inner workings. \u201cSo the plan will be: Deliver some goodies right away; show that you mean business. It\u2019s a very practical platform in that they didn\u2019t make promises that depended on convincing others.\u201dAs was the case with his campaign, Mr. Trudeau will rely on a personal team largely made up of contemporaries \u2014 many of them old friends \u2014 to set his legislative agenda and run the prime minister\u2019s office.Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party won a sweeping victory in Canada\u2019s national election on Monday. Here is a look at how the 43-year-old father of three worked his way to becoming Canada\u2019s second-youngest prime minister.While for the most part those on his team are Ottawa outsiders, they are not inexperienced in their new roles. Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s friend from McGill University, is his closest adviser and the chief architect of the party\u2019s election campaign. In the past, he was principal secretary to Dalton McGuinty, the former Liberal premier of Ontario. Others in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s inner circle have similar backgrounds and connections.But while the Liberals will effectively have absolute control over the House of Commons, the same will not be true of the public service. Even the top positions within Canada\u2019s system are held by professional public servants, not by political appointees.Relations between the public service and Mr. Harper, who openly denigrated the bureaucracy and barred government scientists from publicly discussing their research, verged on poisonous. While a near sweep by Liberal candidates during the election in Ottawa suggests that bureaucrats will welcome Mr. Trudeau, that does not mean the handover will be seamless.\u201cThere are some public servants who only know the Conservative government and only know its way of doing things, so it may be hard to get them working in a new way,\u201d the former bureaucrat said.Officials in the Privy Council Office, the headquarters of the bureaucracy, he said, have already studied Mr. Trudeau\u2019s promises and, separate from the coming prime minister\u2019s transition team, have begun developing recommendations on how to put them in effect.Mr. Trudeau, of course, will not be able to do everything immediately. Developing the party\u2019s legislative timetable \u201cwill require a great deal of reflection by our leader; it\u2019s clearly one of the things he is focusing on,\u201d Ms. Gainey said.\u201cThere will be some things that can easily be done with a stroke of a pen,\u201d she added.The former bureaucrat said that he expected Mr. Trudeau to move swiftly on issues that did not require parliamentary approval, like setting up an inquiry into the disproportionately large number of missing or murdered aboriginal women.Mr. Trudeau, he said, was also careful to make specific commitments only on issues that can be done through direct orders from the cabinet or by Parliament, like increasing tax rates for the wealthy and reducing middle income tax rates.But, he said, Mr. Trudeau makes only broad, sometimes even vague, commitments on issues like developing a new climate change policy \u2014 which will require cooperation or approval by provincial governments. Canada\u2019s provinces fiercely protect their powers, making it difficult for any prime minister to get agreement from their 10 leaders. Mr. Harper notably did not even try. While much of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s platform leaned leftward, other parts of it, like support for the Keystone XL pipeline project, were shared by Mr. Harper.Mr. Trudeau has invited all 10 premiers to join him at the international climate summit in Paris. And issues that will require substantial regulatory and legal changes, like legalizing marijuana, will be stalled through study, the bureaucrat said.At the same time that Mr. Trudeau is setting his legislative agenda, he will also have to choose a cabinet from his caucus. On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau said that he would follow up on a promise to ensure that at least half of the cabinet members are women. The Liberals elected 50 women, so that should not be hard to achieve even with the ever fraught business of ensuring regional representation.It seems unlikely that the Conservatives will be able to spoil the general good will at least in the short term, said Peter Loewen, a political scientist at the University of Toronto.For 10 years, the Conservative Party has identified itself around Mr. Harper even to the extent that government announcements referred to \u201cthe Harper government\u201d rather than the \u201cgovernment of Canada.\u201d His highly centralized administration allowed few of his cabinet ministers to shine. The result is that now that Mr. Harper has said he will resign as leader of the Conservative Party, he has no obvious successor.And while Tom Mulcair has stayed on as leader of the New Democratic Party despite its drubbing at the polls, he faces a leadership review in the spring.\u201cI suspect when Stephen Harper sat down in the prime minister\u2019s office for the first time, he didn\u2019t blink,\u201d Professor Loewen said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we underestimate Justin Trudeau at our peril.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unelected Chamber in Britain Delays Cameron\u2019s Spending Cuts", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In Britain\u2019s general election in May, Prime Minister David Cameron emerged with a majority in the House of Commons and his opponents diminished and in disarray. But on Monday, he suddenly faced a new and unexpected challenge \u2014 when the House of Lords delayed his government\u2019s latest round of spending cuts.The proposal that alarmed many of the Lords, who are unelected, involves scaling back a cash benefit available to people in low-paying jobs.The Anglican bishop of Portsmouth, Christopher Foster, described the proposal as \u201cmorally indefensible.\u201d A former Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, also expressed concern about the consequences for the poorest citizens.Though Britain has been spared the kind of austerity that unfolded in Ireland, Greece and Spain, public spending has been constrained in recent years, and the squeeze is expected to continue for several more.Monday\u2019s vote focused attention on the scale and effect of those spending cuts, on the government\u2019s broader vision of a shrinking state, and on the question of who would be affected.By convention, the House of Lords does not reject finance measures that, like the welfare proposal, have been agreed upon by elected lawmakers.After a highly charged debate, the Lords averted a constitutional crisis by rejecting calls to remove the welfare cuts entirely. Instead, they voted for two motions to delay them, including one to protect existing claimants for three years \u2014 something that could create a fissure in the government\u2019s plans to eliminate Britain\u2019s budget deficit.Mr. Cameron\u2019s office had appealed to the Lords to not contradict elected lawmakers. It remains unclear how the government would respond to the defeat, and whether it would seek to reverse the vote or to revise its spending plans.Tina Stowell, leader of the House of Lords, said that George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, would \u201clisten very carefully\u201d if her colleagues voiced their concerns without blocking the legislation \u2014 a hint that concessions could be made next month.It was Mr. Osborne who proposed reductions in the benefits, a kind of tax credit, that were designed to supplement incomes of workers in low-paying jobs and people with children, whether or not they are employed.Such cuts have been fiercely opposed by the main opposition parties, but have also unnerved some of Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative lawmakers, who are fearful of angry reactions from voters. Coming soon after the annual convention, where the Conservatives presented themselves as a party for working people, the issue has struck an awkward note.Critics argued that up to three million people could be worse off if the proposal passed, and that the House of Lords was entitled to oppose it on technical grounds, because it came in the form of a regulation, rather than a full piece of legislation. The critics also said that, while the government made clear before the election that it wanted to reduce welfare costs, it had suggested that tax credits would be safe.The dispute also was affected by the internal politics of the Conservative Party, and in the positioning to succeed Mr. Cameron, who announced before the general election in May that he would not lead the Tories in the next general election, which is set to be held by 2020.Mr. Osborne, the public face of Mr. Cameron\u2019s austerity policies, is a leading contender to succeed him. A potential rival, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has expressed reservations about cutting the tax credit. Mr. Osborne has been seen as the favorite to become the next leader because his stewardship of the economy was credited by many with helping Mr. Cameron win in May.That victory allowed Mr. Cameron to abandon the centrist Liberal Democrats, who had served as his coalition partners since 2010 and whose parliamentary presence was decimated in the election. Last month, the opposition Labour Party elected a new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a left-winger who is at odds with many of his own lawmakers over crucial policies.By then, Mr. Osborne had outlined his plans to balance the public finances by the end of the decade. Tax credits were a target, the government said, because, since being introduced by a previous Labour government, the cost of the policy has increased from 4 billion pounds, or about $6.1 billion, to \u00a330 billion a year. Some employers pay workers low wages, knowing that the state will supplement them.Mr. Osborne argues that he would help many low-paid workers through other changes in the tax system, and by forcing employers to pay a higher minimum wage. But, while the impact of the changes is disputed, almost everyone agrees that some workers will be hit.One possible government response might be to nominate dozens more Conservatives to the Lords to give it a majority there and drive the measures through. Yet among Mr. Cameron\u2019s campaign promises was one to reduce the cost of politics \u2014 and the House of Lords is already the world\u2019s largest legislative assembly outside China.Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 27 about a challenge by Britain\u2019s House of Lords to a government proposal to reduce a cash benefit for people in low-paying jobs misstated the dollar equivalent of 4 billion pounds, the original cost of the benefit. It is about $6.1 billion, not $6.1 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Call for Competence, Fairness and Leadership in Europe", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyPopulism has infected European politics. But it can be beaten. The three things needed for mainstream politicians to win back control of the debate are competence, fairness and leadership. To some extent, the fight is already succeeding.Demagogic movements of the left and right have gained traction in most European Union countries since the credit crunch. Parties such as the National Front of France, the U.K. Independence Party of Britain, the Five Star Movement of Italy, Podemos of Spain and Syriza of Greece have burst into prominence.Populists are damaging because they propose seemingly attractive policies that would have disastrous results if implemented. This was glaringly the case after Alexis Tsipras \u2014 so far the only one of the current crop of populists to have taken power \u2014 became Greek prime minister in January.The first step, if mainstream politicians hope to beat back populism, is competence. For Europe at the moment, that means competent management of the economy. This is the main explanation for David Cameron\u2019s re-election as British prime minister in May and Pedro Passos Coelho\u2019s victory in Portugal this month. Mariano Rajoy, who is presiding over a fast-growing Spanish economy, should benefit from the same trend when he faces the voters in December.Mr. Passos Coelho and Mr. Rajoy have also benefited from Mr. Tsipras\u2019s terrible first term in office, followed by a huge U-turn that has given the Greek prime minister a chance to redeem himself. This has been a useful antidote to left-wing populism in Portugal and Spain \u2014 so much so that Podemos has dropped to fourth place in some recent Spanish opinion polls.Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, is also pushing hard to establish his credentials for competence. Mr. Renzi has initiated a whirlwind of reforms \u2014 to the gummed-up jobs market, the banking system and the country\u2019s dysfunctional Constitution \u2014 in the hope that this will bear fruit by the time he faces the electorate in 2018.Mr. Renzi seems unafraid to bash far-left populists from foreign countries to remind colleagues in his center-left Democratic Party of the importance of sticking to the middle ground. Last month, he lambasted both Yanis Varoufakis, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s disruptive former finance minister, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France hasn\u2019t shown the same commitment to change as Mr. Renzi \u2014 although his prime minister, Manuel Valls, and economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, have bought into the need to reform France\u2019s sclerotic economy.While competence is the most important way to combat populism, it may not be enough. After all, Mr. Tsipras was re-elected last month despite a dazzling display of incompetence.Part of the explanation is that new parties are not yet associated with corruption. That includes nonpopulist parties such as Ciudadanos of Spain. By contrast, almost all established parties carry baggage.The right-wing ones need to stop kowtowing to big business. The left-wing ones have to cease pandering to trade unions and public employees. But all find it hard to break with their client-list pasts.Mr. Renzi has been the most successful politician in forging a new path. Though a man of the left, he has no truck with the vested interests of the left. He has started to articulate a concept of social justice, a central value for the left, which depends on giving everybody a fair chance rather than doling out goodies to specially favored groups.Mr. Cameron is tentatively taking a similar approach, albeit coming from the right. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference last week, he laid out a liberal, centrist vision of a society where everybody had opportunity. Now he needs to deliver on this.Even competence combined with a modern vision of fairness may not be enough to combat the demagogues. Leadership is also needed. Populism has found fertile ground in the eurozone partly because Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany lacked the courage to explain to her people how their country benefits from the common currency, and how foolish lending by its banks was partly responsible for the Greek crisis.Equally, if Britain quits the European Union, it will be largely down to Mr. Cameron\u2019s lack of leadership. Not only has he done little to explain how Britain benefits from being in the union; his government has even told British business not to campaign in favor of membership until he has finished renegotiating the country\u2019s relationship with it. The field has been left wide open to euro-skeptics to peddle the populist line that Britain can enjoy all the benefits of membership without the costs.Mainstream politicians need to have the guts to take the fight to the demagogues, in the same way that Mr. Renzi is. Combine that with competence and justice, and Europe will be able to keep the populist bacterium from escaping its Petri dish.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Russian Ships Near Data Cables Are Too Close for U.S. Comfort", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.The issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables \u2014 a task American intelligence agencies also mastered decades ago. The alarm today is deeper: The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West\u2019s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.While there is no evidence yet of any cable cutting, the concern is part of a growing wariness among senior American and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the United States is increasingly viewing every Russian move through a lens of deep distrust, reminiscent of relations during the Cold War.Inside the Pentagon and the nation\u2019s spy agencies, the assessments of Russia\u2019s growing naval activities are highly classified and not publicly discussed in detail. American officials are secretive about what they are doing both to monitor the activity and to find ways to recover quickly if cables are cut. But more than a dozen officials confirmed in broad terms that it had become the source of significant attention in the Pentagon.\u201cI\u2019m worried every day about what the Russians may be doing,\u201d said Rear Adm. Frederick J. Roegge, commander of the Navy\u2019s submarine fleet in the Pacific, who would not answer questions about possible Russian plans for cutting the undersea cables.Cmdr. William Marks, a Navy spokesman in Washington, said: \u201cIt would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables; however, due to the classified nature of submarine operations, we do not discuss specifics.\u201dIn private, however, commanders and intelligence officials are far more direct. They report that from the North Sea to Northeast Asia and even in waters closer to American shores, they are monitoring significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of the cables, which carry the lifeblood of global electronic communications and commerce.Just last month, the Russian spy ship Yantar, equipped with two self-propelled deep-sea submersible craft, cruised slowly off the East Coast of the United States on its way to Cuba \u2014 where one major cable lands near the American naval station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It was monitored constantly by American spy satellites, ships and planes. Navy officials said the Yantar and the submersible vehicles it can drop off its decks have the capability to cut cables miles down in the sea.\u201cThe level of activity,\u201d a senior European diplomat said, \u201cis comparable to what we saw in the Cold War.\u201dOne NATO ally, Norway, is so concerned that it has asked its neighbors for aid in tracking Russian submarines.Adm. James Stavridis, formerly NATO\u2019s top military commander and now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said in an email last week that \u201cthis is yet another example of a highly assertive and aggressive regime seemingly reaching backwards for the tools of the Cold War, albeit with a high degree of technical improvement.\u201d\u201cThe risk here is that any country could cause damage to the system and do it in a way that is completely covert, without having a warship with a cable-cutting equipment right in the area,\u201d said Michael Sechrist, a former project manager for a Harvard-M.I.T. research project funded in part by the Defense Department.\u201cCables get cut all the time \u2014 by anchors that are dragged, by natural disasters,\u201d said Mr. Sechrist, who published a study in 2012 of the vulnerabilities of the undersea cable network. But most of those cuts take place within a few miles from shore, and can be repaired in a matter of days.What worries Pentagon planners most is that the Russians appear to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths, where the cables are hard to monitor and breaks are hard to find and repair.Mr. Sechrist noted that the locations of the cables are hardly secret. \u201cUndersea cables tend to follow the similar path since they were laid in the 1860s,\u201d he said, because the operators of the cables want to put them in familiar environments under longstanding agreements.The exceptions are special cables, with secret locations, that have been commissioned by the United States for military operations; they do not show up on widely available maps, and it is possible the Russians are hunting for those, officials said.The role of the cables is more important than ever before. They carry global business worth more than $10 trillion a day, including from financial institutions that settle transactions on them every second. Any significant disruption would cut the flow of capital. The cables also carry more than 95 percent of daily communications.Modern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.Attention to underwater cables is not new. In October 1971, the American submarine Halibut entered the Sea of Okhotsk north of Japan, found a telecommunications cable used by Soviet nuclear forces, and succeeded in tapping its secrets. The mission, code-named Ivy Bells, was so secret that a vast majority of the submarine\u2019s sailors had no idea what they had accomplished. The success led to a concealed world of cable tapping.And a decade ago, the United States Navy launched the submarine Jimmy Carter, which intelligence analysts say is able to tap undersea cables and eavesdrop on communications flowing through them.Submarines are not the only vessels that are snooping on the undersea cables. American officials closely monitor the Yantar, which Russian officials insist is an oceanographic ship with no ties to espionage.American concern over cable cutting is just one aspect of Russia\u2019s modernizing Navy that has drawn new scrutiny.Citing public remarks by the Russian Navy chief, Adm. Viktor Chirkov, Admiral Ferguson said the intensity of Russian submarine patrols had risen by almost 50 percent over the last year. Russia has increased its operating tempo to levels not seen in over a decade. Russian Arctic bases and their $2.4 billion investment in the Black Sea Fleet expansion by 2020 demonstrate their commitment to develop their military infrastructure on the flanks, he said.Admiral Ferguson said that as part of Russia\u2019s emerging doctrine of so-called hybrid warfare, it is increasingly using a mix of conventional force, Special Operations mission and new weapons in the 21st-century battlefield.\u201cThis involves the use of space, cyber, information warfare and hybrid warfare designed to cripple the decision-making cycle of the alliance,\u201d Admiral Ferguson said, referring to NATO. \u201cAt sea, their focus is disrupting decision cycles.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politicians Turn to Start-Ups for Grasp of \u2018Gig Economy\u2019 ", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI never had the expectation that senators and presidential hopefuls would want my views,\u201d said Mr. Zappacosta, 30, who helped found Thumbtack six years ago.Thumbtack is one of several start-ups that are being drawn into the debate over the future of work by politicians and policy makers. With the approach of an election year in which income inequality is expected to be fiercely debated, the security \u2014 or lack of security \u2014 that these types of jobs provide has become a central issue.Many of today\u2019s technology start-ups are enabling people to try to make a living by fulfilling one-time tasks or doing freelance work, fueling the rise of the gig economy. The trend is exemplified by Uber, the giant ride-hailing company, which directly employs about 4,000 people but has more than 160,000 drivers in the United States who depend on it for at least part of their livelihood.Politicians are seeking out start-ups like Thumbtack to learn more about how they work, especially because their business models represent a counterpoint to Uber\u2019s.While Uber requires drivers to use its app to find passengers for rides, for example, Thumbtack merely arranges an introduction between a worker and a job \u2014 the relationship is maintained outside the company. Other start-ups that have been approached by politicians include Munchery, a food delivery company that employs its chefs and drivers, and Managed by Q, an on-demand office maintenance service that also has full-time workers. (By contrast, Uber drivers are classified as independent contractors.)\u201cWe create numerous jobs in every market we\u2019re in,\u201d said Tri Tran, chief executive of Munchery, which hosted Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, in August for a conversation with tech start-ups including Shyp, Instacart and Uber. \u201cUber and Airbnb create a massive amount of jobs in different ways. When that happens, policy makers have to pay attention.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment.\u201cThis time last year few politicians were paying attention to the work force that powers these start-ups, and now they\u2019re trying to figure out how to protect them,\u201d Professor Sundararajan said.That legal strife has since prompted a stream of policy makers and politicians to visit start-up executives in Silicon Valley, and tech leaders to head to Washington to discuss worker protections and classifications.David Kochel, the chief strategist for Mr. Bush, said the candidate was reaching out to start-ups because \u201cthe gig economy is transforming the way we think of work.\u201d\u201cYou have to be on the ground to understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.Start-up executives say they have pushed politicians to be more proactive on the topic of the future of work. When Mrs. Clinton visited Munchery, for example, Mr. Tran said, he urged her to be a \u201cleader\u201d on the issue.\u201cWhether or not she becomes the next president, she\u2019s in a position to influence policy makers and champion the ways that mobile devices and technology are coming up with new ways to offer flexible job opportunities,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said she had visited Munchery to understand better how to support entrepreneurship.Last month, Mr. Warner also visited several Silicon Valley companies, including Lyft and Airbnb, to talk about the future of labor. Coming up with parameters to deal with the shifting nature of work \u201cis too important to leave to the courts alone,\u201d he said in an interview. He added that he was worried the United States could end up with a patchwork of state laws that provide uneven protection for workers.Mr. Zappacosta said start-ups were becoming more interested in politics generally as they begin to engage in issues like employment laws. He said he had participated in panels where start-ups were pushing lawmakers to take a more complete view of what it means to freelance; some want lawmakers to create a new worker classification that better describes the jobs offered by some companies that fall somewhere between full-time employment and independent contracting.The ways these start-ups are changing work \u201cisn\u2019t just about the gig economy,\u201d Mr. Zappacosta said. \u201cThis is about the whole economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Glowing Hearts, a Nation Unites Behind the Blue Jays", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. JOHN\u2019S, Newfoundland \u2014 The vast stretch of Blue Jays Nation is awoken by dawn\u2019s rosy glow at Cape Spear, a rocky promontory jutting out into the frigid North Atlantic, about 1,300 miles from Rogers Centre in Toronto.It is known as the easternmost point in North America, closer to Portugal\u2019s Azores Islands than to Toronto, and just a short sail to Greenland. But make no mistake: This, too, is Blue Jays country.\u201cOh, we are 100 percent behind the Jays,\u201d Evan Puddister said Wednesday as he sat on the wheelhouse of the Gesmer I, a family-owned ferry docked in St. John\u2019s harbor. \u201cThat\u2019s all people are talking about here.\u201dCanada, a nation of some 35 million, has only one Major League Baseball team, with the Expos having moved to Washington in 2005. Some Canadians may prefer the Minnesota Twins, the Seattle Mariners or the Boston Red Sox, but from Vancouver to Moose Jaw to Witless Bay just south of here, the Blue Jays are the home team.\u201cWhen you have a whole country pulling for you, it\u2019s different than other teams,\u201d Jose Bautista, the Blue Jays\u2019 slugging right fielder, said in a recent interview. \u201cMaybe the Yankees are the only ones who can say they have as many fans as we do. We hear it from every angle.\u201dIn the United States, there are 29 teams. Some, like the Yankees, the Atlanta Braves, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Red Sox, have historically enjoyed overwhelming regional popularity. But none have attracted the full support of their nation.The Blue Jays get it all.In Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, fans formed a Facebook page to complain about the early starting times of Blue Jays playoff games in the Pacific time zone. Viewership for the Blue Jays\u2019 playoff games is said to be over seven million across Canada.In Vancouver, British Columbia, a big issue recently was whether bars would open for postseason games that started at 9:30 a.m. Some did.St. John\u2019s is in the Newfoundland time zone \u2014 oddly enough, 1 hour 30 minutes ahead of Toronto and New York. It is not the only unique thing about this enchanting land, where icebergs float off the wind-swept coast and the local accent is infused with the most distinct Irish brogue heard west of Tralee.The first pitch of Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, which the Blue Jays won, 7-1, was at about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday (4 p.m. in Toronto and New York). Mike Buist, a former Mets minor league pitcher, and his friends gathered at the local Elks club to watch on a large projector screen.Buist (pronounced boost) was signed by the Mets in 1964 and played alongside Tug McGraw for the Mets in the Florida Instructional League, and he later pitched against Nolan Ryan in the minor leagues. Born in Hamilton, Ontario, he moved to St. John\u2019s after his playing career ended, and he began coaching and administering in the local baseball leagues.Buist is the executive director of St. John\u2019s Minor Baseball, which supervises and organizes youth leagues for some 600 children. There are also adult leagues like St. John\u2019s Amateur Baseball.\u201cPeople here love baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest and participation. And, of course, everyone is following the Jays.\u201dMark Healy is the president of St. John\u2019s Amateur Baseball and, even at 42, is a catcher for Holy Cross, a local team. He also helps run one of the indoor winter leagues. He had a curling match on Wednesday but was still eager to watch Game 5 at the pristine arena just outside downtown St. John\u2019s.He noted that Newfoundland had produced good college players, including Gerald Butt, an outfielder who was drafted by the Yankees in 1994 and played several years in independent leagues.Hockey is still the national sport, but baseball has its place, too, and the Blue Jays are Canada\u2019s team.\u201cEvery kid now has some piece of Blue Jays paraphernalia,\u201d Healy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of Blue Jays rallies here. There\u2019s a ton of interest and hype right now. Everyone is talking about it and questioning all of the manager\u2019s moves.\u201dThe Blue Jays conduct clinics all around Canada, including a popular Girls\u2019 Day clinic in St. John\u2019s. They also refurbished one of the local fields. Geographically, that would be like the Red Sox running clinics and fixing up fields in Omaha.Newfoundland, the setting for Annie Proulx\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u201cThe Shipping News,\u201d is an island whose nickname is the Rock. It does not do justice to its breathtaking coastal views and charming local flavor.For centuries, it was a stopping point for explorers, traders and settlers. Cod was abundant and the fishing industry flourished, and now the local economy is also heavily invested in oil and shipping.There is also ample hunting and fishing in Newfoundland. Michael Saunders, an injured Blue Jays outfielder, grew up in Victoria, British Columbia, but spent his boyhood summers in Gander, Newfoundland, at his grandparents\u2019 hunting and fishing lodge about 130 miles northwest of St. John\u2019s.He would while away the long daylight hours fishing and playing in the wilderness, but the only sport he played here was soccer.\u201cI loved it there,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cBut after I was about 12, I started concentrating on sports, and I haven\u2019t been back since. But I\u2019ve heard they are big time into the Jays.\u201dRod Dunne, a 32-year-old painter, is one of those fans. He said he never misses a game, even when the Blue Jays are not good.\u201cEverybody around here is into the Blue Jays,\u201d said Dunne, a lifelong resident of St. John\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the only team in Canada.\u201dSt. John\u2019s itself is a quaint port town of about 100,000 on the eastern edge of the Rock, full of art galleries, coffee shops and a Labatt brewery. The local arena hosts the St. John\u2019s IceCaps, a minor league hockey outfit, and the harbor is choked with Coast Guard vessels, tankers and ferries, like Puddister\u2019s Gesmer I.Puddister, 24, watched Game 4 of the A.L.C.S. below deck with co-workers on a satellite feed, but it turned out to be a 14-2 loss for the Blue Jays. He had planned to watch Game 5, a most happy affair, at one of the many pubs that line St. John\u2019s famous George Street.\u201cDeadly game,\u201d he said in a text message after the Blue Jays won Game 5. \u201cSuch a big win.\u201dEarlier in the day, Roger Tonkin walked by wearing a crisp new Blue Jays cap. Tonkin, 31, is a derrick man on oil rigs. He spends three weeks on the rigs and three weeks off back home in Toronto, using St. John\u2019s as his transport hub. The rigs are 150 nautical miles off shore and require a two-hour helicopter flight from St. John\u2019s.\u201cWe do watch a lot of Blue Jays games on the rig,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing well like now, everyone is into it.\u201dDown the block, at Maverick Sports & Collectables, Andrew Corbett, the proprietor, opened the store 16 years ago, but he has never had business as he does now. \u201cIn the last month, we probably sold as much as we have in the last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe suppliers can\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201dCorbett\u2019s small store, just a minute\u2019s walk from the waterfront, had a long waiting list of anxious customers hoping their shirts would arrive before game time Wednesday. With the Blue Jays on the verge of elimination, there was fear that the goods would not show up in time for what could have been the final game.But the Blue Jays won in a rout \u2014 Troy Tulowitzki hit a bases-clearing double, and Toronto\u2019s pitching dominated \u2014 and so the sun will come up over Cape Spear again to signal a new day for a vast Blue Jays nation.As two visitors walked out of Corbett\u2019s store and into a chilled rain, Corbett had a request.\u201cIf you see a delivery truck,\u201d he said, \u201csend them here quick.\u201dAn article in some editions on Thursday about Canada\u2019s relationship with the Toronto Blue Jays misspelled, in one instance in some copies, the surname of the president of St. John\u2019s Amateur Baseball in Newfoundland. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Mark Healy, not Healey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 2nd Fed Governor Opposes Raising Rates This Year, Breaking With Yellen", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe comments by two officials on the Federal Open Market Committee who rarely speak publicly about monetary policy suggested that Ms. Yellen is facing growing internal opposition to the view she expressed last month that it will probably make sense to start raising rates this year to maintain control of inflation.\u201cYellen appears to have a revolt on her hands,\u201d said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon who follows the central bank closely. \u201cShe now faces the prospect of multiple dissents from the dovish wing of the F.O.M.C. if she insists on pushing through with a rate hike this year. Such a split decision would not enhance the institution\u2019s credibility.\u201dMs. Brainard, a former Obama administration official who joined the Fed in 2014, and Mr. Tarullo, an adviser to Mr. Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign before joining the Fed in 2009, both have roots in the world of Democratic economic policy making.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Leading members of that community, including the Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers, have sharply criticized the Fed\u2019s movement toward raising interest rates. Those critics have coalesced around a fairly uniform set of concerns that appear to resonate with Ms. Brainard and Mr. Tarullo.The differences, however, remain relatively narrow and could be resolved by new rounds of economic data in the coming months. Slower growth could persuade Ms. Yellen \u2014 who also has strong Democratic credentials and was a chief economic adviser to President Bill Clinton \u2014 to wait a little longer. Better news or rising inflation could persuade the skeptics to move more quickly.Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that despite the fragmentation of the policy making committee, he expected Ms. Yellen and her right-hand man, Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Fed, to maintain control.\u201cWe still believe the Yellen-Fischer leadership can pull the committee together for a December liftoff, but in the interim the communications may continue to sound inharmonious,\u201d he wrote Tuesday.The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since 2008 to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. Now, in the sixth year of a slow-but-steady expansion, officials are debating the right moment to start raising rates.The Fed could stall the economy if it scares borrowers by raising rates too quickly. Waiting too long could also end badly if inflation starts to rise or speculative asset bubbles pop.The most likely date is the final 2015 meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy making committee on Dec. 15 and 16. Fed officials have said they are not likely to act at the committee\u2019s Oct. 27 and 28 meeting.The Fed said Tuesday, in a scheduled release, that eight of the 12 regional reserve banks had supported a September increase in a secondary but symbolic rate called the discount rate.Two Fed officials were already on the record as opposing a rate increase this year: Charles L. Evans, the Chicago president, and Narayana Kocherlakota, the Minneapolis president. But regional Fed presidents often take public stands. The Washington-based governors like Mr. Tarullo and Ms. Brainard seldom do.The unemployment rate is approaching a normal level by historical standards, but by other measures the labor market remains weak. Moreover, the historical pattern that inflation rises as unemployment falls \u2014 a relationship that economists call the Phillips Curve \u2014 has weakened in recent years. Inflation is also being suppressed by other forces, including a strong dollar, low energy prices and what Mr. Tarullo described as a \u201cglobally disinflationary environment.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows how much more progress could be made in a noninflationary fashion,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cMy own perspective is that one should watch to see some tangible evidence that inflation would return to target.\u201dHe said the Fed could not easily correct its mistake if it moved too soon and growth stalled.Ms. Brainard would not say when she expected to start raising rates, but she expressed even stronger reservations than Mr. Tarullo that strong job growth was a sufficient reason to do so as long as inflation is quiescent.\u201cI do not view the improvement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for inflation,\u201d she said. \u201cA variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic Phillips Curve influence of resource utilization on inflation is, at best, very weak at the moment.\u201dMs. Yellen said in September that if the Fed waited to raise rates and then was forced to increase rates more sharply to control inflation, it \u201cwould risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.\u201dMs. Brainard said she was not overly concerned the Fed might wait too long.\u201cWe have well-tested tools to address such a situation,\u201d she said, \u201cand plenty of policy room in which to use them.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Congressmen Propose Barring U.S. Prosecutors From Reading Inmates\u2019 Emails to Lawyers", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bill introduced on Thursday by two members of Congress would bar federal prosecutors from reading emails between inmates and their lawyers, ending a practice that has angered defense lawyers and divided judges.Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from Brooklyn, and Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia, sponsored the bill, which Mr. Jeffries said would correct an emerging inequity in the criminal justice system.\u201cI assume that most fair-minded prosecutors understand that our system of justice requires a dynamic where individuals are able to have the effective assistance of counsel necessary to adequately defend themselves,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said in an interview, adding that \u201cemail is the most efficient way for an attorney to communicate with an incarcerated client.\u201dBrooklyn federal prosecutors argued that prisoners had to agree to terms of service telling them that emails could be monitored when they used the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 email system. Prosecutors said it was a logistical issue: The bureau\u2019s system could not distinguish emails to lawyers from other messages, which are automatically monitored. The office of the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York no longer wanted to appoint \u201ctaint teams\u201d to sort through the emails, as it had been doing.Defense lawyers in a handful of cases in Brooklyn had objected to that, arguing that it hindered the right to counsel. In-person visits, postal mail and phone calls are all considered protected by lawyer-client privilege. However, arranging such interactions was inefficient, lawyers said \u2014 a single visit to a jail could take several hours of travel and waiting. They needed access to unmonitored email, they argued, to provide effective counsel.Federal judges in Brooklyn, and around the country, were split on the issue. In one case last year, a district judge, Dora L. Irizarry, instructed prosecutors to stop the practice, suggesting they were looking for a strategic advantage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me you don\u2019t want to know what your adversary\u2019s strategy is? That\u2019s hogwash,\u201d Judge Irizarry told a prosecutor.In another case, another district judge, Allyne R. Ross, ruled that because defense lawyers had other ways of communicating confidentially with their clients, the government\u2019s policy did not unreasonably impinge on the defendant\u2019s rights, and she allowed the practice to continue.Mr. Jeffries said that he had spoken to the Bureau of Prisons, and that people at the agency said its email system did not allow inmates\u2019 emails to lawyers to be filtered from other emails.\u201cWe live in an era where there\u2019s been tremendous innovation that has taken place across every spectrum of our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me that we have the ability to develop a system where attorney-client communication can be segregated out.\u201dThe Bureau of Prisons referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond.Alan Dayley, a research director at Gartner, a technology-information company, said a number of tools were available to capture emails based on criteria such as \u201csent to\u201d or \u201creceived from,\u201d and the tools \u201ccan also capture certain email based on content.\u201dThe bill would allow an exception in cases where the attorney general believes there is a national security issue.Doug Jones, a former United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama who is now in private practice, said the legislation was sensible.\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult representation to represent a client who is in custody,\u201d Mr. Jones said.He gave the example of Birmingham defendants who were kept at a county jail three blocks from him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think that would be a problem, but it\u2019s an itty-bitty room; it\u2019s hard to bring tapes and transcripts and other things,\u201d he said, adding that it was also difficult to contact a client with a quick question.Donald K. Stern, a former United States attorney for Massachusetts, said that while there would no doubt be some cost to overhauling the email system, there was also a cost to the current setup. Court-appointed defense lawyers who have to spend several hours trying to visit their clients are ultimately paid by the government, he pointed out.\u201cYou have to balance the cost of doing that with the importance of permitting the ability of counsel to communicate freely with a client,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThe lawyer ought to be able to have very free access to their clients \u2014 not only for the right to counsel and the Sixth Amendment, but also to provide a more efficient and fair criminal justice system.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Politics", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Bashing the country of Voltaire has long been a favorite pastime in American Republican politics.The French were mocked as \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d in 2003 for opposing the Iraq war, and French fries were renamed \u201cfreedom fries.\u201dGrimacing with apparent mock horror, he said: \u201cI mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek?

Despite the symbolism of the 35-hour week for many French as a sign of the country\u2019s enviable work-life balance, many employers find ways to circumvent the law, including paying overtime at higher rates.Full-time French workers last year put in an average of 38.9 hours a week, compared with the eurozone average of 39.6 hours a week, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Nevertheless, France\u2019s governing Socialist Party has been deeply reluctant to change a law that some now regard as quintessentially French as pain au chocolat, and attempts to question the 35-hour workweek by the country\u2019s young economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, have sometimes spurred open rebellion.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Next From Christo: Art That Lets You Walk on Water", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been a decade since those 16 days in February 2005 when the artist duo Christo and Jeanne-Claude installed 7,500 gates along Central Park\u2019s walkways, each adorned with shimmering saffron-colored panels creating what Christo described as \u201ca golden river appearing and disappearing through the branches of the trees.\u201dIt was a spectacle like no other in the park\u2019s long history. The $20 million project, financed by the sale of Christo\u2019s artworks, pumped nearly $250 million into the city\u2019s economy and attracted four million visitors. \u201cIt put New York City in the international headlines for something hopeful for the first time since 9/11,\u201d recalled Patricia E. Harris, the former deputy mayor and, for decades, a leading supporter of the project with her boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cIt reminded the world that our city\u2019s artistic spirit was alive and well.\u201dAnd also showed the world that art has the power to change the landscape. Whether they were wrapping the Reichstag in a million square feet of fabric, or raising a 365-foot-high curtain across a valley in Colorado, Christo and Jeanne-Claude produced visual feats that resonated with the public in a way few artists ever have. \u201cYou become part of the dialogue,\u201d said Germano Celant, the Italian curator. \u201cThese projects are a kind of dream, one that everybody can understand and everybody can participate in.\u201dIn fact, Christo has been quietly busy, juggling several projects at once. And now, he is poised for a comeback on his own. His first commercial art exhibition in nearly 50 years opens on Nov. 6, at the Craig Starr Gallery in Manhattan, with examples of some of his earliest works, his Show Windows and Store Fronts, architectural installations he started making in the early 1960s, shortly after he and Jeanne-Claude arrived in New York from Paris.A wiry figure with tufts of snow-white hair, Christo speaks quickly, with a thick Bulgarian accent, in a high-octane, animated fashion. He often gets so wound up that he is actually unable to sit still.\u201cI love to work; I love to walk. Basically I like to move around and do physical things,\u201d he said recently, wearing baggy bluejeans and a light blue shirt, pacing up and down the second floor of his SoHo home and studio in a 200-year-old building he and Jeanne-Claude bought in 1973. This is where collectors come to buy his artwork \u2014 impeccably rendered collages of his projects, with the proceeds channeled back into his public projects. Right now the walls are filled with \u201cFloating Piers\u201d drawings alongside some of his wrapped objects, including an old-fashioned wall telephone clad in canvas and plastic tied together with bits of old string.\u201cI don\u2019t like anything about computers,\u201d Christo continued. \u201cYoung people today on their flat screens, it\u2019s all virtual; nothing is real. All our projects involve real things \u2014 real wind, real sun, real wet, real danger, real drama. And this is very invigorating for me.\u201dBut another very real constant throughout his career is the often excruciating process of waiting \u2014 sometimes decades \u2014 for a project to come to fruition. Works are sometimes held up because of politics \u2014 securing the necessary government clearances and permits or wading through opposition from local dissenters. Other times, delays are caused by the sheer complexity of the undertaking.Christo and Jeanne-Claude waited 32 years to shroud 161 trees in black and white polyester mesh in a park in Basel, Switzerland; nearly 25 years to get the green light to install \u201cThe Gates\u201d in Central Park; 24 years for the German government to give the approval to wrap the Reichstag in Berlin in aluminum-colored fabric; 10 years for French authorities to approve their vision for shrouding the Pont Neuf in Paris with 454,178 square feet of champagne-colored textile; seven years before they were able to plant a forest of umbrellas in the rice paddies near Tokyo and along the hillsides of Southern California.\u201cI turned 80 in June,\u201d Christo declared one afternoon during an interview at his house. He recalled a car ride he took last year from Stuttgart, Germany, to his warehouse in Basel, Switzerland, with his nephew Vladimir Yavachev, and Wolfgang Volz, his photographer and the project manager of \u201cThe Floating Piers.\u201d\u201cI cannot wait so long anymore,\u201d he told them. \u201cI am not sure I will live another 10 years. I think we should do something not so complicated. Something we can manage. Something we can actually get done.\u201dJeanne-Claude had taken care of the practical side of their projects \u2014 the organization and financial details \u2014 leaving Christo to throw himself into the creative end. \u201cI have always worked alone,\u201d he explained about his art. He has kept his studio a family affair, relying on Jeanne-Claude\u2019s two young assistants: Mr. Yavachev, now operations manager of \u201cPiers,\u201d and Jonathan Henery, Jeanne-Claude\u2019s nephew, who runs Christo\u2019s office.\u201cI\u2019m always missing Jeanne-Claude,\u201d Christo said a bit wistfully. A brilliant problem-solver, \u201cher ferociously critical mind\u201d has left a huge void, he said.\u201cThe Mastaba\u201d is to be one of Christo\u2019s few permanent installations and \u2014 though it may have been designed years ago \u2014 it feels fitting to ask if he isn\u2019t seeing it in different terms now, perhaps as a marker of his life and mortality.Balking at the premise that it is in any way about death, he instead called this monumental work \u201ca very natural, three-dimensional shape that is older even than a pyramid.\u201dIn contrast, \u201cThe Floating Piers,\u201d 60 miles east of Milan, has been a breeze. \u201cGiuseppe Faccanoni, the president of the lake, helped us get the permissions in less than a year,\u201d Christo said. \u201cI wanted to go back to Italy. We have done projects there before. There\u2019s great food, beautiful landscape.\u201dLake Iseo is perhaps the least known of Italy\u2019s northern lakes, an idyllic spot with two small islands not yet overrun with tourists (unlike Lake Como, known for celebrity residents like George Clooney). To Christo, Lake Iseo also offers a storybook landscape. \u201cIt has beautiful small villages and houses and churches and Roman ruins. To go to the mainland, residents go by traghetto,\u201d he said, using the Italian word for a small boat or ferry. \u201cThe Floating Piers\u201d will connect the islands to each other and to the mainland. \u201cYou will be able to walk the entire area,\u201d Christo explained. The project will also be visible from the surrounding mountains. As the light changes throughout the day, the view of the piers will change, too, from deep yellow to shimmering gold to a reddish hue when wet.About a half-million people are expected to visit \u201cThe Floating Piers,\u201d its opening timed to coincide with the last two days of Art Basel, the contemporary art fair, an easy pilgrimage of roughly 275 miles. The project is estimated to cost about $11 million, money Christo said he has already raised from the sale of his art. (Works for sale in Craig Starr\u2019s show range from $400,000 for a collage to $7 million for one of the 1960s Store Fronts, similar to the ones first shown by Leo Castelli, the legendary dealer.)Mr. Celant, the project director of \u201cThe Floating Piers,\u201d helped Christo get the necessary approvals. Scientists, structural engineers and divers, along with teams of construction workers, have been involved in the Piers creation, floating a section with the covered fabric on a lake in Germany last year to see how they would look. In February, Christo tested the structural integrity of the piers for wind and wave heights by placing sections in the Black Sea. Starting in December, divers will place 140 five-ton anchors up to 300 feet deep in Lake Iseo. Right now, about one million square feet of fabric is being specially woven in a factory in Germany.The final installation is expected to take a week and will involve a team of some 600 workers.Again, as he and Jeanne-Claude did beginning in the 1980s, Christo plans to give each visitor a party favor of sorts, perhaps an actual piece of fabric from the installation. \u201cNormally it\u2019s a postcard you bring home,\u201d Mr. Celant said. \u201cA bit of fabric becomes a part of history.\u201dGiven the ephemeral nature of these installations, all that remains is the indelible memory. \u201cIt creates an incredible urgency,\u201d Christo said, \u201cbecause it will never take place again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Minimum Wage: How Much Is Too Much?", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHE federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. While Congress has refused to take action, Democratic politicians have been engaged in something of a bidding war to propose raising the minimum wage ever higher: first to $10.10, then to $12, and now some are pushing for $15 an hour.When Congress delays raising the minimum wage, states and cities typically step in and raise their own minimum wages. That is exactly what is happening now.When I started studying the minimum wage 25 years ago, like most economists at that time I expected that the wage floor reduced employment for some groups of workers. But research that I and others have conducted convinced me that if the minimum wage is set at a moderate level it does not necessarily reduce employment. While some employers cut jobs in response to a minimum-wage increase, others find that a higher wage floor enables them to fill their vacancies and reduce turnover, which raises employment, even though it eats into their profits. The net effect of all this, as has been found in most studies of the minimum wage over the last quarter-century, is that when it is set at a moderate level, the minimum wage has little or no effect on employment.I am frequently asked, \u201cHow high can the minimum wage go without jeopardizing employment of low-wage workers? And at what level would further minimum wage increases result in more job losses than wage gains, lowering the earnings of low-wage workers as a whole?\u201dBut $15 an hour is beyond international experience, and could well be counterproductive. Although some high-wage cities and states could probably absorb a $15-an-hour minimum wage with little or no job loss, it is far from clear that the same could be said for every state, city and town in the United States.More logical is the proposed legislation from Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, calling for raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. Their bill is co-sponsored by 32 senators, and supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. High-wage cities and states could raise their minimums to $15.Although the plight of low-wage workers is a national tragedy, the push for a nationwide $15 minimum wage strikes me as a risk not worth taking, especially because other tools, such as the earned-income tax credit, can be used in combination with a higher minimum wage to improve the livelihoods of low-wage workers.Economics is all about understanding trade-offs and risks. The trade-off is likely to become more severe, and the risk greater, if the minimum wage is set beyond the range studied in past research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For True Freedom, Learn to Deal With Uncertainty", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyAlmost 10 years ago, I knew a guy on a financial rocket ship. He had a great house, a successful business and a solid income.But then things changed. With the benefit of hindsight, it was clear he bought a little too much house and spent a little too much money. At the beginning, he was rewarded for buying the house. Its value went up a lot in a short time. For context, imagine Florida, Arizona or Las Vegas in 2006-7. Houses were selling even before hitting the official market and for way more than the asking price.Things continued to go well for this guy, and he decided to borrow money against the equity in his home to start a new business. But not long after, the rocket ship ran out of fuel.The value of his home dropped. In fact, the house eventually was worth less than what he paid for it. Then, his income dropped significantly because his business was tied closely to the local economy.Again, with the benefit of hindsight, this story looks like a series of obvious mistakes. And to his credit, this guy took full responsibility for every one of those decisions. Along the way, he dealt with mental and physical stress while trying to juggle the web of consequences arising from this experience.I imagine you can relate personally to this story or know someone who can. Given our history of booms and busts over the last 15 years, you\u2019ve probably watched some version of this story play out more than once.Now fast-forward a couple of years. This guy had a bunch of stuff go well in his life. He now has superpositive net worth. His relationships are better than ever. He has taken steps to avoid repeating earlier mistakes.Notice how loaded the language is, with the emphasis on whether and when I was deserving.Over a series of conversations with a friend, I talked through my story and realized I could only identify the mistakes I made with the benefit of hindsight. As is often the case, it is very easy to look backward and make up stories about why certain things happened and then take either the blame or the credit for them. The reality of life is often a bit more nuanced. As I carefully reflect on the good and the bad experiences, I have come to the conclusion that, in both cases, I was simply doing the best I could with the knowledge and experience I had at the time.But when we look back at our stories, we need to be careful. Because, as I told my friend, \u201cI can\u2019t define exactly what I did to deserve the bad stuff or to deserve the good stuff.\u201dBased on my past experiences, I reasoned with my friend, \u201cIf you fast-forward five years, I could end up homeless or own a private jet, or anything in between.\u201d This friend, who happens to be a life coach, replied, \u201cYeah, and if you can get yourself to accept that, you\u2019ll finally be free.\u201dIt took me awhile to understand what he meant. But I realized he was talking about the freedom we feel when we let go of the idea that we \u201cdeserve\u201d any specific outcome.We\u2019re certainly not free of personal responsibility. But consider the people who say they believe they can control their future. They tell themselves the story that if they just plan carefully enough, they can achieve certainty about what will happen.For years, many of us have believed this myth. In reality, life is irreducibly uncertain. That doesn\u2019t make us more or less successful or more or less happy. The true joy in life, the real peace, comes when we let go of the idea that we deserve a predetermined happy ending.Of course, we\u2019re going to have a goal on the horizon, and we\u2019ll head toward it. But we may wake up tomorrow and say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the best direction to go anymore.\u201d We then need to ask ourselves if things have changed, or if our goal just feels too hard. Do we need to push through a tough spot or chart a different path?Right now, I\u2019m working really hard on both having goals and accepting the reality of uncertainty. In fact, I embrace the uncertainty and say to myself, \u201cGiven that goal, and given the uncertainty, what\u2019s to be done next?\u201dI repeat this process over and over. Every once in a while, I stick my head up and say, \u201cI still want to head to that goal. Yes, I\u2019m uncertain I\u2019ll get there, but for now, I think that\u2019s where I want to go.\u201d Then, I put my head back down, figure out what\u2019s to be done next and go do it.Whatever the goal, we can learn to trust ourselves and deal with the reality of uncertainty. And for me that\u2019s become the definition of true freedom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data Transfer Pact Between U.S. and Europe Is Ruled Invalid", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ruling, by the European Court of Justice, said the so-called safe harbor agreement was flawed because it allowed American government authorities to gain routine access to Europeans\u2019 online information. The court said leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, made it clear that American intelligence agencies had almost unfettered access to the data, infringing on Europeans\u2019 rights to privacy.The court said data protection regulators in each of the European Union\u2019s 28 countries should have oversight over how companies collect and use online information of their countries\u2019 citizens. European countries have widely varying stances toward privacy.Data protection advocates hailed the ruling. Industry executives and trade groups, though, said the decision left a huge amount of uncertainty for big companies, many of which rely on the easy flow of data for lucrative businesses like online advertising. They called on the European Commission to complete a new safe harbor agreement with the United States, a deal that has been negotiated for more than two years and could limit the fallout from the court\u2019s decision.Some European officials and many of the big technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, tried to play down the impact of the ruling. The companies kept their services running, saying that other agreements with the European Union should provide an adequate legal foundation.But those other agreements are now expected to be examined and questioned by some of Europe\u2019s national privacy watchdogs. The potential inquiries could make it hard for companies to transfer Europeans\u2019 information overseas under the current data arrangements. And the ruling appeared to leave smaller companies with fewer legal resources vulnerable to potential privacy violations.\u201cWe can\u2019t assume that anything is now safe,\u201d Brian Hengesbaugh, a privacy lawyer with Baker & McKenzie in Chicago who helped to negotiate the original safe harbor agreement. \u201cThe ruling is so sweepingly broad that any mechanism used to transfer data from Europe could be under threat.\u201dAt issue is the sort of personal data that people create when they post something on Facebook or other social media; when they do web searches on Google; or when they order products or buy movies from Amazon or Apple. Such data is hugely valuable to companies, which use it in a broad range of ways, including tailoring advertisements to individuals and promoting products or services based on users\u2019 online activities.The data-transfer ruling does not apply solely to tech companies. It also affects any organization with international operations, such as when a company has employees in more than one region and needs to transfer payroll information or allow workers to manage their employee benefits online.Frans Timmermans, the first vice president for the European Commission, which will be charged with carrying out the ruling, tried to ease the concerns of companies on Tuesday. He said businesses could still move European data to the United States through other existing treaties.He added that the European Commission would work with national privacy regulators to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was carried out in a uniform fashion across the entire region.\u201cCitizens need robust safeguards,\u201d said Mr. Timmermans. \u201cAnd companies need certainty.\u201d\u201cFor those who are willing to take on big companies, this ruling will have empowered them to act,\u201d said Ot van Daalen, a Dutch privacy lawyer at Project Moore, who has been a vocal advocate for stricter data protection rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The safe harbor agreement has been in place since 2000, enabling American tech companies to compile data generated by their European clients in web searches, social media posts and other online activities.Under the deal, more than 4,000 European and American companies had been expected to treat the information moved outside the European Union with the same privacy protections the data had inside the region. The United States government had lobbied aggressively in Brussels in recent months to keep the agreement in place.The United States and the European Union have worked for roughly two years on a new safe harbor agreement. The court\u2019s ruling now puts pressure on negotiators to complete an agreement, but it may also complicate matters.Any new deal had already been expected to give Europeans greater say over how their online information is collected, transferred and managed by tech companies. But the talks have stalled over what type of access to European data American intelligence agencies should be given, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In addition, legal experts said that even if a new deal is reached, the court\u2019s decision would most likely still give the national privacy regulators some say over the transfer of data.In its ruling, the European court noted that the region\u2019s 500 million citizens did not have the right to bring legal cases in United States courts if they believed their privacy had been infringed by American companies or by the United States government. A bill to provide this legal recourse is being debated in Congress, though analysts said it was unlikely to become law before the American elections next year.Penny Pritzker, the American secretary of commerce, said she was disappointed about the European court\u2019s decision, adding she would work with the European Commission to finalize the new safe harbor agreement.The legal ruling \u201cputs at risk the thriving trans-Atlantic digital economy,\u201d she said in a statement on Tuesday.The lengthy negotiations have highlighted the different approaches to online data protection. In the United States, privacy is viewed as a consumer protection issue; in Europe, privacy is almost on a par with such fundamental rights as freedom of expression. Last year, Europe\u2019s top court ruled that anyone with connections to the region could ask search engines like Google to remove links about themselves from online results. European campaigners said this so-called right to be forgotten ruling would help protect people\u2019s online privacy, while many in the United States said the decision would curtail online freedom of speech.Those differences became more pronounced after Mr. Snowden revealed how American and British intelligence agencies had seemingly unfettered access to people\u2019s online activities.\u201cThe United States safe harbor scheme thus enables interference, by United States public authorities, with the fundamental rights of persons,\u201d the judges said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to access to European data by American intelligence agencies.That program is reported to have given the American agency significant access to data collected by several American tech companies. Facebook denies that the United States government had unlimited access to its users\u2019 data.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Schrems, who is pursuing a separate civil class-action lawsuit against Facebook in an Austrian court, praised the decision.\u201cGovernments and businesses cannot simply ignore our fundamental right to privacy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must abide by the law and enforce it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The resulting \u201ctransboundary haze,\u201d as it is known, has placed mounting pressure on the Indonesian government to devise a long-term solution. And it has exposed the inability of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to cooperate on cross-border issues that originate in one member state.At a recent Asean meeting in Kuala Lumpur, an Indonesian member of Parliament in charge of international relations and environmental affairs issued a formal apology to Malaysia and Singapore for this year\u2019s disruption. This echoed previous apologies made by Indonesian leaders, notably the former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\u2019s following the record-breaking 2013 haze.Much of the frustration felt in Malaysia and Singapore lies in the lack of institutional means to force Indonesia\u2019s hand. Asean, which provides a forum for the region\u2019s diplomatic relations, was formed on principles of national sovereignty and nonintervention \u2014 an approach that none of its members are keen to upset.While the political tussles continue, Indonesia remains the worst victim of its fires, with pollution readings reaching a record high of 984 in the central province of Riau, where 26,000 cases of acute respiratory ailments have been recorded this season. As always during the haze, thousands of army and police personnel were sent in to combat the fires, and cloud-seeding operations were tried.

{"Headline": "Argentine Front-Runner for President Is Expected to Resolve Standoff With U.S. Hedge Funds", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 As Argentina prepares for a new president, a glimmer of hope has emerged that a ferocious standoff with American hedge funds may be resolved within months.On Sunday, Argentines will vote on who will succeed President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. The front-runner, Daniel Scioli, has at times shared her taste for fiery populist oratory.Nonetheless, if elected president, he is expected to quietly seek a compromise with the hedge funds over nearly $100 billion of bonds that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to close out the holdouts issue,\u201d said Gustavo Marangoni, an economic adviser to Mr. Scioli. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pebble blocking a funnel of investment.\u201dThe standoff has kept the country locked out of global lending markets. Mrs. Kirchner has maneuvered to reach the end of her presidency without the need to return to those markets, but a new leader would need access to help rectify Argentina\u2019s economy, analysts said.\u201cWhoever wants to govern Argentina needs a country with access to capital markets,\u201d said Federico Thomsen, an economist based in Buenos Aires.That will mean ending the feud with the hedge funds, often referred to as holdout creditors \u2014 or \u201cvultures,\u201d in the words of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s government \u2014 led by a unit of the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s firm, Elliott Management. The impasse dates to 2012, when Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Argentina could not service the debt it restructured in the years after its 2001 default if it did not pay the litigating holdout creditors, in full, at the same time.Argentina refused to accept the ruling, earning rebukes from Judge Griesa. Even facing the judgment of a United States federal court, Argentina issued dollar-denominated bonds this year under local law, but it had to pay premium interest rates of 8 to 9 percent. This angered the holdouts, who claim the new debt was marketed internationally and therefore subject to Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling.Mrs. Kirchner, 62, who is not permitted to run for a third consecutive term, has led a crusade against the hedge funds, accusing them of extorting her government.Polls here suggest that Mr. Scioli could win on Sunday without the need for a runoff. His closest challenger is Mauricio Macri, a former businessman and soccer club president who has traditionally been viewed more favorably by investors. Mr. Macri has said that he would negotiate with the holdouts.Yet politics colors these positions. Mr. Macri\u2019s statements appear to have been intended as just criticisms of the government. In interviews, Mr. Macri\u2019s economic advisers said they would let the issue languish and straighten out the economy by addressing other problems.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s life or death for Argentina,\u201d said an adviser, referring to resolving debt dispute.And on the campaign trail, Mr. Scioli, having been endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner, has been nearly as aggressive as the president in calling for a \u201cworld without vultures.\u201dMr. Scioli, a former powerboat racer turned state governor, indicated that he would not improve on the terms agreed to by a majority of bondholders in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010. They received about a 65 percent \u201chaircut\u201d with some deals enhanced by payments pegged to Argentina\u2019s growth rate. That is an offer that the hedge funds have already rejected.\u201cArgentina\u2019s proposal is clear,\u201d Mr. Scioli, 58, told reporters recently, smoking a cigarillo on the sidelines of a boxing match at a sports club he built next to his home in the Paran\u00e1 River delta. \u201cWe have to see now if they have the willingness to adapt to what Argentina has been offering.\u201dMr. Scioli\u2019s reliance on Mrs. Kirchner \u201cmeans he cannot address these issues publicly,\u201d Nicholas Watson, who analyzes Argentina for Teneo Intelligence, a global advisory firm based in New York, wrote in a note to clients.But if Mr. Scioli wins the presidency, he is expected to forge his own path, independent of the ideological constraints of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s leftist political movement, known as Kirchnerismo. \u201cKirchnerismo is over,\u201d said an adviser to Mr. Scioli who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cSoon enough, they\u2019ll realize.\u201dMr. Marangoni and Mario Blejer, another adviser, said that Mr. Scioli\u2019s government would reinitiate talks that have long been at an impasse.\u201cI\u2019m in favor of opening negotiations with a very firm stance,\u201d Mr. Blejer said in an interview.A third adviser, Miguel Bein, who could not be reached for comment, said at a conference in May that Argentina might pay up to 70 percent of the roughly $1.7 billion owed to the holdouts, a sum that includes interest.That may not be enough to satisfy the holdouts, who have asked for nothing less than the full $1.7 billion.Mr. Scioli is expected to make other changes in economic policy, including reducing monetization of the fiscal deficit to calm inflation, which is estimated at more than 25 percent, and a gradual devaluation of the peso that could help lure foreign investment and boost competitiveness.These will require tapping global bond markets to bring in dollars, said Jimena Blanco, who monitors Argentina for Verisk Maplecroft, a risk analysis firm in London.In the short term, the country may also need those dollars to bolster the central bank\u2019s reserves, which dropped far below $30 billion this month after the government paid off $5.9 billion of maturing bonds.Although many economists agree that Argentina should end the dispute with the hedge funds so it can bring in dollars by issuing debt abroad, others offer another argument: that the country can talk but delay a deal until the hedge funds cede ground and, in the meantime, attract big foreign investment or even issue debt.Another presidential candidate, Sergio Massa, 43, an energetic lawmaker who bolted from Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s party in 2013, supports this approach.Mr. Massa said he would seek to strengthen his negotiating position with the holdouts by first returning to debt markets, using risk mitigation instruments offered by regional development banks to issue bonds at around half the rate investors currently demand.\u201cArgentina cannot go to Griesa\u2019s bench and surrender,\u201d Mr. Massa said at a lunch with reporters.If the government reaches a settlement in the coming months, it could still have trouble raising money if it does not also make repairs to its economy, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York. She cited Argentina\u2019s fiscal deficit, which is estimated at about 7 percent of gross domestic product, and the precariousness of the central bank\u2019s reserves.\u201cDoes legal access to the markets mean market demand?\u201d Ms. Morden said. \u201cNo. The markets aren\u2019t lenders of last resort.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Theme", "Date": "2015-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile alienation among Republicans has drawn more attention, given the fiery language of the race\u2019s front-running celebrity, Mr. Trump, the anti-establishment mood on the left is just as intense and potentially just as consequential to the selection of a Democratic nominee.Mrs. Clinton has tried to lift her declining poll numbers by highlighting endorsements from governors and lawmakers \u2014 but such establishment backing has yet to do much good. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could face the same anti-establishment headwinds if he enters the race, given his four decades in Washington, although allies believe he has the personal touch to win over angry Democrats. Mr. Sanders castigates \u201cthe entire political and economic establishment\u201d regularly, by contrast, a message that has drawn 650,000 donors and huge crowds of fervent supporters, like the 20,000 people at his Boston rally on Saturday evening.\u201cI volunteered for Hillary when she ran for president in 2008, but her time is past, I think,\u201d said Nikky Raney, 25, a Democrat from Dover, N.H. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Bernie who seems most genuine about universal health care and getting big money out of politics.\u201dThough Mrs. Clinton remains popular in the party, especially among those who want to see a first female president, Mr. Sanders\u2019s call for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and his consistently left-wing policy ideas are inspiring to younger voters, seniors and liberals who would prefer to see a true believer overcome an establishment goliath.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cIncome inequality has been growing for so many years that a lot of young people feel their Democratic leaders aren\u2019t fighting hard enough on the issue,\u201d said Brandon Lemay, the president of the Plymouth State University Democrats, after attending a speech by Mrs. Clinton near the campus in central New Hampshire. Mr. Lemay said he was undecided between her and Mr. Sanders. \u201cHillary has definitely been refining her message to sound more liberal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Bernie\u2019s convictions are just very strong, very intense.\u201dImpatience with politics-as-usual has also led liberals to enter Democratic Senate primaries and mount more aggressive and well-financed challenges than in years past to candidates backed by the national party establishment. In Florida, Representative Alan Grayson, a self-styled \u201cprogressive champion,\u201d is portraying Representative Patrick Murphy, the Democratic Party\u2019s preferred candidate for the seat being vacated by Senator Marco Rubio, as a \u201clightweight, empty-suit errand boy for Wall Street.\u201d A former president of the Chicago Urban League, Andrea Zopp, is running in Illinois against the party-backed Representative Tammy Duckworth. And former Representative Joe Sestak is running as a liberal anti-establishment candidate in Pennsylvania.The contested primaries extend to House races. In New Jersey, a 24-year-old Sanders supporter, Alex Law, is challenging Representative Donald Norcross, portraying him as a machine politician.The disaffection among Democrats flows mainly from three sources, according to interviews with voters and strategists. Disappointment lingers with President Obama over the failure to break up big banks after the Great Recession and fight for single-payer health insurance, among other liberal causes. Fatigue with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s controversies endures, as does distaste with her connections to the rich. And anger abounds at party leaders for not pursuing an ideologically pure, economically populist agenda.\u201cEstablishment Democrats like Hillary could end up heavily outspending people like Sanders, but it may not matter as much as usual because voters are searching for someone off the beaten path,\u201d said Paul Maslin, who was the pollster for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential race.Tom Henderson, the Democratic chairman in Polk County, Iowa, which includes Des Moines, said the most widely shared frustration among Democrats there was \u201cthe manner in which the economy has bounced back\u201d under Mr. Obama: Wall Street returns look strong and unemployment has declined, but wages and benefits are largely unchanged.\u201cI think Sanders is pulling in voters who aren\u2019t typical rank-and-file Democrats, but rather folks who have become energized over the last few years to change the country\u2019s direction,\u201d said Mr. Henderson, who is currently neutral in the race. \u201cThe question for Sanders is whether he can get those people to show up and vote in February.\u201dAcross the country, discontent on the left is bubbling up in scattered ways.Liberal activists in Iowa and elsewhere have pushed local Democratic officials to enact minimum-wage ordinances in the face of inaction from state and federal government officials in both parties. Environmentalists put enormous pressure on Mrs. Clinton to come out against the Keystone pipeline project, which she did last month. Many progressives in New York City complain that the Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, appears to have lost his appetite for a criminal justice overhaul.And last week, about 80 Democrats in New Hampshire banded together to demand that the Democratic National Committee allow candidates to participate in more debates than the six that the party has sanctioned. Many activists see the limit as rigging the debates in favor of Mrs. Clinton, whose advisers wanted as few as possible.\u201cThere\u2019s a level of anger among Democrats that the establishment has decided not to address, whether it\u2019s about debates or other issues,\u201d said Peter Burling, a former New Hampshire state senator who is supporting former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland in the presidential primary.If Mr. Sanders proves too liberal to capture the nomination, allies of Mr. Biden believe the vice president is positioned to seize on anger at the establishment if he enters the race \u2014 even though his long tenure epitomizes it. These supporters say the freely emotional Mr. Biden is more capable of soothing Democratic anxieties than Mr. Sanders, a flinty Vermonter, or Mrs. Clinton, whose attempts to appear more likable and funny can come across as overly calculated.\u201cThere\u2019s just so much hopelessness about people having any real opportunity to just make a living, take care of their families, support themselves,\u201d said Karen Bryant, a physician from New Boston, N.H. \u201cMrs. Clinton is floundering and Republicans like Jeb Bush are floundering because people see them as politicians whose messages change depending on who they are talking to or how much money they need to raise. If you live year after year not seeing politicians keep their promises, it leads you to support someone like Bernie Sanders.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Repeal the Cadillac Tax", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsSURPRISINGLY, there appears to be one small area of bipartisanship in Washington: the desire to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax. It is a tax on super-expensive health insurance plans provided by some private companies to their employees. The tax would be paid by employers who sponsor these high-cost plans.In 2018, it is scheduled to be the final aspect of the Affordable Care Act to go into effect. Republicans desperately want to show they can repeal some aspect of the health care law. Under pressure from unions, some Democrats, now including Hillary Rodham Clinton, want to eliminate or postpone the Cadillac tax, too.Rather than a triumph of bipartisanship, this would be a big mistake, for a number of reasons. In its first eight years, the Cadillac tax will raise some $91 billion. Repeal it and politicians \u2014 if they are being fiscally responsible \u2014 will have to find other sources of revenue rather than add to the deficit.But more important, the tax makes sense. It was imposed to counter the negative effects of the government subsidy of company-paid health insurance. We can\u2019t get rid of that subsidy, but we can reduce its impact. The subsidy was encoded in law in 1954, when Congress passed an act making an employer\u2019s contribution to the premiums for workers\u2019 health insurance tax-free. This legislation gave employers an incentive to expand health insurance. Today, about half of all Americans get their insurance through their employer (or the employer of a relative) \u2014 and benefit from the tax exclusion.But the subsidy has created serious problems. For one thing, it is hugely regressive. The rich receive nearly triple the financial benefits from the tax exclusion than those with lower incomes because they are taxed at a higher rate and tend to have much more expensive health insurance. The health care tax exclusion is the single largest tax break in the United States, reducing federal revenue by more than $250 billion per year.By providing an incentive for the purchase of ever-more-generous health insurance, the tax exclusion has been a major driver of health care inflation. By covering more services, offering more choices and lowering the costs people experience, expensive plans encourage people to use more health care services and, when there are options, more expensive services.For instance, patients might use the emergency room for sore throats, or go to specialists instead of their primary care physician to adjust their blood pressure or thyroid medications, because their more generous insurance plan lowers the cost of using these expensive options.This is no small matter. According to several economists\u2019 recent analyses, the tax exclusion may account for a more than 30 percent increase in health care spending for those with employer-sponsored insurance, because of this incentive to use more health care services.In thinking through health care reform, President Obama supported reform of the tax exclusion because of its central role in fighting the scourge of health care inflation. He and his congressional allies recognized that the health care law needed to combine modifications to Medicare and Medicaid with changes in the private sector to effectively fight inflation.The Cadillac tax levies a 40 percent excise tax on the portion of total health insurance premiums that exceed $27,500 for a family in 2018 and $10,200 for an individual. By way of comparison, in 2015 average premiums in employer-sponsored insurance for a family are $17,545 and for an individual, $6,251.While many people believe that employers pay for their health insurance, economists have shown over and over that it is workers who pay for the higher fringe benefit through lower wages. Thus, if health insurance costs and premiums go up, workers will see even more anemic pay raises. In addition, as health care costs go up, people have less money to purchase other goods and services, lowering growth in other parts of the economy.Finally, as health care costs go up, so does government health care spending in Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies provided to people purchasing in the exchanges. Through taxes, Americans pay for higher federal and state government spending on health care.If there is to be reform of the Cadillac tax, a responsible approach could be to limit the financial benefits of the tax exclusion to $2,000 (or less) for households making over $250,000 and totally eliminate it for households making over $1 million. This would raise additional revenue that could be used to soften the impact of the Cadillac tax on less well-off Americans.The public is complaining bitterly about the growing out-of-pocket expenses for health care. This is a big problem, largely driven by employers who are shifting costs through higher premiums and more deductibles to their workers. The best way to lower out-of-pocket costs is to rid our health care system of inefficiency and waste.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tuk-Tuks, Three-Wheeled Outsiders, Make Themselves at Home in Lisbon", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLisbon JournalLISBON \u2014 Residents of this port city of faded beauty and ornately tiled facades have welcomed a surge of tourists in recent years who have helped turn around its economic slide.But the foreign visitors, they will tell you, have also come with their share of trade-offs. Rapid redevelopment, spurred by tax breaks granted to foreign property buyers, has driven up rents and widened disparities. Streets are more crowded, the traffic worse.And then, there is the tuk-tuk.In just a couple of years, about 300 of the motorized, three-wheel vehicles have swarmed Lisbon\u2019s narrow cobblestone streets, offering tourists an alternate way of navigating this hilly city, famous, too, for its network of trams and funiculars.While visitors have flocked to the tuk-tuk, those who live in this city of about 550,000 have begun to fume about pollution, noisier streets and a verging \u201cquality of living problem,\u201d according to Miguel Gaspar, a Portuguese transportation consultant.\u201cThe growth of the tuk-tuks has been such that they\u2019re even being sold to tourists as something typical of Lisbon, which really isn\u2019t true,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re now like pigeons, just everywhere.\u201dWhile the tuk-tuk is no longer common in Europe, the three-wheel vehicle originated in Italy, designed by the same engineer who developed the Vespa motor scooter, as a cheap way to rebuild city transportation after the devastation of World War II.Since then, they have become popular in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa, where they are prized for their compact size and high maneuverability.In Lisbon, a city heavy with history, the tuk-tuk made rapid inroads for the same qualities, which allow them to negotiate the old city\u2019s many tight corners and steep slopes and to park almost anywhere, which they do.The new rules will even put some streets out of bounds for tuk-tuks, as well as require the vehicles to run on electric engines by 2017.Lisbon\u2019s new restrictions also apply to other so-called tourism entertainment vehicles, including the yellow go-karts that have been another hit with visitors, but that may present even more of a nuisance.In an interview, Mr. Medina said his goal was to \u201cregulate but not end\u201d the thriving tuk-tuk business.\u201cRunning a city is about managing conflicts and finding the right balance between a good tourism service and the rights of the people who work and live in this city,\u201d he said, \u201cand now the tuk-tuks are changing that balance.\u201dIn Lisbon, as one might expect, no one is more put out by the tuk-tuk craze than the city\u2019s taxi drivers. In June, police officers detained one such driver who got into a street brawl with a tuk-tuk driver and threatened him with a hammer.\u201cTuk-tuks are terrible news and completely unfair competition,\u201d said Rui Tavares, a taxi driver, who said he had spent 850 euros, or about $940, on his taxi driver certification.\u201cIt\u2019s taken effort, time and money for me to become a taxi driver while these guys can start driving people around from Day 1, without any professional qualification,\u201d he said.Tuk-tuk drivers say the regulatory clampdown aimed at them is further evidence of an overpowering taxi lobby that has led the crusade against Uber.But they also see the curbs as counterproductive, at a time when tourism has spearheaded the recovery of the Portuguese economy, which required an international bailout during the debt crisis.Indeed, for tourists, the tuk-tuk experience is all about enjoying the ride through a scenic city, rather than necessarily seeking the quickest and cheapest way to get from Point A to Point B.In that regard, some tuk-tuk drivers pride themselves on playing tour guide, as well as driver. The basic tour of historic Lisbon includes a stopover at the S\u00e9 Cathedral, as well as other landmarks, like the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle.\u201cWe start with a route in mind, but it\u2019s then about building some kind of relationship and intimacy with the clients and adapting to whatever they want to do, however fast or slow,\u201d said Miguel Cardoso, a painter who has been driving a tuk-tuk for the past three months.\u201cIf somebody wants to spend almost the whole hour just watching the Tagus, that\u2019s fine by me,\u201d he said, referring to the river on whose outlet to the Atlantic Ocean the city sits.J\u00f6rg Heinermann, who heads the Portuguese subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz, the German carmaker, argued that, even in their short time here, tuk-tuks \u201chave become almost as symbolic of Lisbon as its trams.\u201dWhenever he has foreign visitors, Mr. Heinermann said, he tries to include a tuk-tuk tour in their Lisbon schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s just great to be taken around by a Portuguese who explains his own city in his own individual way,\u201d he said.\u201cSome show you the homes of writers and other famous people, others just want to drive around the smallest streets possible, while others show you where to buy your Port wine or listen to fado,\u201d Portugal\u2019s traditional music, he said.Even as the transportation battle has heated up, some have decided to climb aboard the tuk-tuk bandwagon rather than fight it, like Jos\u00e9 Alves, a taxi company owner who expanded into the tuk-tuk business three months ago.Mr. Alves, who now owns six tuk-tuks with his company Colourtrip, alongside his six taxis, described the tuk-tuk as the perfect vehicle in which to discover the city.\u201cA taxi takes you to a specific place, but the tuk-tuk is the right choice if you just want to wander around,\u201d he said. \u201cLisbon has so many hills and narrow streets that it\u2019s really a made-for-measure place for a tuk-tuk.\u201dStill, even Mr. Alves backed the idea that tuk-tuks should be subject to restrictions comparable to those that apply to Lisbon\u2019s 3,500 taxis.\u201cThe way this market is developing,\u201d he said, \u201cwe could have 3,000 tuk-tuks next year, so of course rules must be set.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Formula One\u2019s Bumpy Road to Sochi", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Russian Grand PrixWhen teams, drivers and the Formula One retinue arrived at the Sochi Autodrom for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix last year, the general feeling among them was that they could have been at any other modern circuit on the racing calendar, somewhere like Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur or Barcelona, or even Austin, the capital of Texas.The pit and paddock area, which had been administrative buildings during the Olympics (although the plan had always been to transform them for use by Formula One), were comparable to those at other new tracks around the world.At 5.8 kilometers, or 3.6 miles, in length, the Sochi track is the third-longest circuit in use, behind Spa-Francorchamps, in Belgium, and Silverstone, in England.Adding to the mix, the circuit is in a region quickly being transformed as a leading vacation destination, with a backdrop of mountains on one side and the Black Sea on the other.Those attractions are a little far from the track, but that is also the case at many other Formula One sites where tourism is not always easily mixed with race attendance \u2014 such as in Istanbul, Suzuka in Japan or Mokpo in South Korea.For the series, though, the route to Russia was a long and torturous one. Formula One had been trying to establish a race in the country for more than 30 years, facing various obstacles in what became one of the longest and most dogged hunts for a venue in any country.President Vladimir V. Putin had personally helped to bring the race to Russia, and he has remained behind the continuing plans to develop the site of the 2014 Winter Games.But as with certain other Grand Prix locations \u2014 including Bahrain; the coming Azerbaijan race next year; and, to a smaller degree, China \u2014 critics pointed out the many political and humanitarian reasons the series should not be run in Russia.Before the first Grand Prix in Sochi, Russia had recently annexed Crimea and was accused of helping anti-government rebels in Ukraine. It had also been linked to the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over the Ukraine. And a Human Rights Watch report at the time said, \u201cSince Putin\u2019s return to the Kremlin in 2012, Russia has resorted to the worst repression of human rights since the end of the Soviet era.\u201dSo, not for the first time, Formula One was vilified for refusing to call off its race, with many of the series\u2019s stakeholders arguing that sport and politics do not mix.In fact, politics had always lingered over a potential race in Russia. Bernie Ecclestone, the series promoter, made his first efforts to find a venue in the Soviet Union following the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which had been boycotted by the United States and other countries to protest the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan.But it was not only political concerns that weighed on the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. Just days before, at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, Japan, Jules Bianchi, a 25-year-old French driver, had been involved in a horrendous accident, striking at high speed a recovery vehicle beside the track. He suffered a serious brain injury, from which he would die nine months later.It would take the final three races of the season for Hamilton to secure his second drivers\u2019 title.After the Russian Grand Prix, though, the Formula One circus had been happily persuaded that \u2014 politics aside \u2014 the series had found a new venue with its own character and personality.\u201cFormula One is a global spectacle and it shows the strength of the sport that we race in Russia,\u201d Federico Gastaldi, the Lotus team director, said last week. \u201cWe should be racing in the world\u2019s biggest country. We have seen over the last 20 years or so, since the change from the Soviet Union, that the opportunities there are huge. The rapid expansion of the economy and the many big sporting events that are being held here over the next decade will make for great momentum in commercial opportunities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The government\u2019s official target for the year is growth of around 7 percent.\u201cChina was facing increasing downward pressure of domestic economic development\u201d in the first nine months of the year, the official statistics agency said in a statement accompanying the data released Monday morning in Beijing. Still, it added, \u201cthe overall performance of the national economy was stable and moving in a positive direction.\u201dUncertainties over China\u2019s decelerating growth have shaken global stock markets in recent months as investors have raised doubts about the quality of Chinese economic data and the transparency of the country\u2019s policy decision-making process. Concerns have been heightened by China\u2019s botched attempt to prop up its stock markets in July and the surprise move in August to devalue its currency, the renminbi, by the most in nearly two decades.Data released Monday showed continued pressure, with industrial production rising 5.7 percent in September, near its slowest pace since the financial crisis. Overall investment rose 10.3 percent in the first nine months of the year, its slowest rate of increase in 15 years.In response, China\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates five times since last November, and has taken other steps to free banks to lend more. The government has also pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on new infrastructure projects, including rail lines and water treatment plants, to help lift growth.Mixed policy signals from China have roiled global investors. Here are five officials who are calling the shots in Beijing.\u201cWe don\u2019t really trust the overall growth figures,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist following China at Capital Economics. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest the economy is growing significantly slower than that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the G.D.P. data, particularly the breakdown, doesn\u2019t tell us anything.\u201dHe pointed to the rising share of services and consumption in the overall economy, which continued to gain prominence in the third quarter despite the slump in activity related to the stock market.For example, while a continued contraction in housing construction weighed further on the industrial sector, sales of newly completed or existing homes have been rebounding sharply \u2014 helping lift business at services companies like property agencies.Compared with the April to June quarter, the third quarter \u201chad some additional weakness in industry, but that\u2019s been made up by some strength in services,\u201d Mr. Evans-Pritchard said. \u201cThings look to have been pretty stable overall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Idaho City of Immigrants Debates Taking In Middle Eastern Refugees", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey came from Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War, Eastern Europe after the Soviet Union\u2019s implosion, Bosnia as ethnic cleansing wracked the Balkans, and Africa to escape genocide and civil war.But Idahoans say that those refugees, different as they were in culture and language, also shared something powerful with the sturdy agricultural families that have anchored this corner of the West since the first Mormon pioneers in the 1800s: They were on America\u2019s side, residents here said, having fought against Communism, or as allies of American troops, or in places friendly to the United States.This time, people here said, feels different.In an echo of the ferocious debate that is gripping Europe about the fate of the millions of Syrians thrown from their country by civil war, Twin Falls is grappling with the question of whether taking in a next generation of refugees from the Middle East is wise and safe.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about radical Islam,\u201d said Richard L. Martin Jr., a petition-drive leader who graduated from high school here in the mid-1980s. Back then, Mr. Martin said, Twin Falls was still taking in refugees from places like Laos, including a boy who became one of his best friends. \u201cNow it\u2019s something different,\u201d said Mr. Martin, the owner of a small medical products repair company.On Sept. 22, in a measure of how intensely the subject has aroused the community, about 700 people filed into an auditorium at the college for a forum with local school and public safety officials and a representative from the State Department.Some of the questions asked of the panelists were easy to answer, like whether refugees ever struggled to get jobs in Twin Falls, which has a population of 46,000 and a countywide unemployment rate of 3.7 percent. The answer was an emphatic no.\u201cThey get jobs really fast,\u201d said Zeze Rwasama, the director of the refugee center and a former refugee himself, from the Democratic Republic of Congo.Other questions were more pointed.\u201cCan you offer guarantees that we\u2019ll be safe?\u201d asked the panel moderator, Matt Christensen, the editor of The Times-News, a local newspaper, who posed questions submitted by audience members.The answer, from Lawrence Bartlett, the director of refugee admissions at the State Department, was that life did not come with guarantees, but that background checks and security tests were strong, and under review to make them stronger.\u201cNothing is 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said.The refugee debate in Twin Falls is also complicated by the question of trust in government \u2014 or perhaps more aptly here, a lack of trust.Don Hall, the mayor of Twin Falls, a former police officer who now teaches in the law enforcement program at the College of Southern Idaho, said he believed that refugees had a positive influence locally. But many conservatives here and around the nation, he added, simply do not believe the federal government is acting in their interest, whether in health care legislation or in the reassurances that all will be well with Syrian refugee resettlement.\u201cWe\u2019re all feeling a little disenfranchised,\u201d he said. \u201cWashington is not listening to us.\u201dReligion is not far below the surface, either.Jennifer Thornquest is among those who have responded from the other side, arguing that Twin Falls should follow the teachings of Jesus and practice what she calls \u201cradical hospitality.\u201d Ms. Thornquest, who works as a D.J. for weddings and other events, maintained a 24-hour prayer vigil earlier this week on a highway bridge over the Snake River on the edge of town, sometimes holding signs about welcoming refugees, other times praying, she said. People came to stand with her.\u201cAll these things added up in my mind, and I had to do something,\u201d she said.At the community meeting, support for refugees and the refugee program was also evident when a man stood up near the end of the two-hour program and told members of the panel that one question had not been put on the table: \u201cWhat can we do to help the refugees?\u201d he asked, to loud applause from many in the audience.Supporters of the refugee program said they believed that the economy in Twin Falls had been bolstered by the work ethic and determination of refugees like Akembe B. Bilombele, a 38-year-old native of the Democratic Republic of Congo who arrived here in August with his family of five after seven years in a refugee camp in Malawi.\u201cWhatever work I can do, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mr. Bilombele, a former schoolteacher who speaks four languages, said in an interview at the refugee center.\u201cWe\u2019ve had success with them,\u201d said a Glanbia spokeswoman, Peggy Watland, referring to the refugees. \u201cThey\u2019re hard workers, they show up, they support their families, and they\u2019re good participants in society.\u201d One former refugee, Liyah Babayan, who arrived here 20 years ago as an 11-year-old from Azerbaijan and now owns her own women\u2019s clothing store on Main Street, said she believed that the anti-refugee talk was driven by a small minority. She said she measured acceptance in business terms \u2014 local people shop in her store, she said, even though they do not have to.\u201cCash doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d she said.But Alex Joye, who owns a chain of gun and pawn shops in the Boise area, came here to speak against the refugee center, saying that past waves like the one that brought Ms. Babayan were not good predictors of the future.\u201cEurope is having a lot of trouble integrating Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can expect the same trouble here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save Puerto Rico Before It Goes Broke", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPuerto Rico\u2019s government is on the verge of running out of money. A messy default is in nobody\u2019s interest, which is why Congress ought to move swiftly to provide the American territory with a way to restructure its huge debt and revive its economy.Political leaders in Puerto Rico and many financial and legal experts have been saying for months that the territory cannot repay the approximately $72 billion it owes to hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors. Its economy is not growing, and tens of thousands of residents are leaving every year for the mainland to look for work. More than 300,000 have left in the last 10 years.Bankruptcy seems inevitable. But under federal law, Puerto Rico\u2019s government, its municipalities and its government-owned utilities cannot go to bankruptcy court \u2014 hence the administration\u2019s request for a new bankruptcy process for territorial governments and a change in the law to allow Puerto Rican cities and public utilities to seek Chapter 9 protection, much as local governments like Detroit and Orange County, Calif., have done.Many investors who have lent money to Puerto Rico and stand to lose under any debt restructuring are bitterly opposed to the Obama plan. They say Puerto Rico can repay all of its debt if it tightens its belt and privatizes utilities and other government-owned businesses. Changing the law now, they argue, is deeply unfair. But the record of what has happened in troubled countries like Greece is clear: Austerity policies have only worsened the crisis. As for the fairness argument, legislators change laws all the time to meet new circumstances.What investors must realize is that an orderly restructuring is a far better alternative than the long and complex legal battles that would inevitably follow a sudden default. American bankruptcy courts have a good track record of resolving complicated debt cases. And if, in addition to reworking the bankruptcy law, Congress also created an oversight board, as the Obama administration recommends, investors could have some confidence that Puerto Rico\u2019s politicians would make needed policy changes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sensible Pricing Comes to High-Risk Debt Securities", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneFor the first time since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s response, which was to drive down the cost of money to near zero \u2014 some rational pricing seems finally to be seeping into the market for the riskiest debt securities. This correction in the price of bonds is good news for investors, for markets generally and for the rest of us who hope not to suffer another deleterious credit collapse fueled by fee-seeking underwriters and speculators on Wall Street.A little background: It turned out that the combination of the Fed\u2019s recent policies of quantitative easing \u2014 an extensive $4 trillion effort to drive down long-term interest rates by bidding up the price of high-yielding debt securities \u2014 and its policy of keeping short-term interest rates as close to zero as possible for as long as possible have together been highly effective at keeping rates at low levels.The Fed\u2019s not-incorrect logic was that in the face of congressional unwillingness to enact a robust fiscal stimulus program, its robust monetary policy would kick-start an economy moribund after the shocking events of 2008 by making borrowed money cheap.Of course, there was collateral damage. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary intervention drove up the prices of many debt securities and lowered their yields, since the price of bonds trade in inverse proportion to their yields. As a result, for years investors have been engaged in the yield hunger games, scouring the world for higher returns on fixed-income securities than could be otherwise found in the safer confines of, say, the market for United States Treasury securities, where the yield on the 10-year bond is now around 2 percent.The investor frenzy to find higher yields had the consequence of driving up the price of high-yield bonds \u2014 among the riskiest debt securities around \u2014 and pushing down their yields to around 5 percent, which is what, in normal markets, an investor might expect to receive from bonds offered by top corporate issuers like General Electric or Johnson & Johnson. For years, risk has been mispriced as investors bid up the high-yielding debt securities in an effort to find something that paid them a decent return. But, of course, that\u2019s a fool\u2019s game, because eventually reality sets in.And now it has. For the first time since 2012, the collective yield on junk bonds rose in early October to above 8 percent, an increase of nearly 300 basis points since May 2013, according to an index of domestic high-yield bonds published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For investors who bought bonds at par in May 2013, the collapse in prices that corresponded with the higher yield means they have suffered some serious losses on their bonds. (Of course, they should have anticipated that when they bought them in the first place at such dizzying prices.)Bonds issued by companies in the independent energy sector, the metals and mining sector and oil field services sector have been the hardest hit as commodity prices have fallen. But bonds in other industries are also likely to fall in price, too. Standard & Poor\u2019s, the credit ratings agency, has downgraded the debt of more companies so far this year than in the last two years combined; in the third quarter alone it lowered ratings on some $211 billion of debt. According to Moody\u2019s, a rival to S.&P., some $50 billion of bonds and bank debt have defaulted so far in 2015. Moody\u2019s has compiled a list of another 44 companies it thinks might soon also default on their debt.I asked Christina Padgett, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s focused on leveraged finance, why the bond market had suddenly come to its senses after years of insanity. She started working in the high-yield debt market in 1998. She conceded she was not exactly sure. \u201cIt is a confluence of factors,\u201d she said, \u201cand not necessarily the same for the loan and bond markets.\u201d But she cited a few reasons: Increased volatility is \u201cnot good\u201d generally for the leverage finance market, nor was the late summer \u201cdowndraft\u201d in the equity markets. (The recovery in stocks in the last few weeks has also led to a bit of a recovery in the high-yield market.)Ms. Padgett also noted that a large portion of the high-yield market was composed of issuers in the energy sector, which has come under severe economic pressure as commodity prices have collapsed. She said she understood why investors in recent years had reached for yield. \u201cThere\u2019s very little yield in the world today and still lots of liquidity,\u201d she said. But she is still surprised at how badly risk has been mispriced.\u201cThere was no such thing as single-digit yields for single B\u2019s,\u201d when she started in the business, she said, referring to junk bonds with a B rating. Nevertheless, she told me, credit sensitivity seemed to be increasing as evidence mounted that the market was on the other side of the credit cycle. She added that the largest impact was probably a decline in opportunistic deals and dividends and the more aggressive leveraged buyouts.This is all good news. The time is long overdue for the insanity in the credit markets to come to an end. Investors need to be adequately compensated for the risks they are taking when they buy debt of tenuous credit quality. That\u2019s the only way to make sure the credit markets operate smoothly.It\u2019s healthy to see that investors are starting to wise up after seven years of a Fed-induced high. A big test of the newfangled investor sentiment looms: In the coming weeks, Dell, which is rated BB by S.&P. after of its leveraged buyout in 2013, will issue some $15 billion of high-yield debt to finance its audacious $63 billion takeover of EMC Corporation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Partnership Is Reached, but Faces Scrutiny in Congress", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations on Monday reached final agreement on the largest regional trade accord in history, teeing up what could be the toughest fight President Obama will face in his final year in office: securing approval from Congress.Now the deal faces months of scrutiny in Congress, where some bipartisan opposition was immediate. That debate will unfurl against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in which populist anti-trade talk against the deal is already prominent.Still, for Mr. Obama the accord could be a legacy-making achievement, drawing together countries representing two-fifths of the global economy, from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia, into a web of common rules governing trans-Pacific commerce. It is the capstone both of his economic agenda to expand exports and of his foreign policy \u201crebalance\u201d toward closer relations with fast-growing eastern Asia, after years of American preoccupation with the Middle East and North Africa.\u201cWhen more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can\u2019t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cWe should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment.\u201dThat argument \u2014 that the Pacific pact would be a bulwark against China\u2019s power and a standard-setter for global commerce \u2014 will be central to the president\u2019s hard sell ahead to Congress, administration officials said.For Mr. Obama to win Congress\u2019s approval, he will have to assemble a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, building out from the political center to marginalize resistance on the left and right. Earlier this year, the president relied heavily on Republicans to win approval of so-called fast-track trade authority, which will allow a vote on the Pacific accord without threat of amendments or filibuster.This time, the president probably will need more Democrats\u2019 votes. Final concessions his team made in Atlanta angered the tobacco and brand-name pharmaceutical industries, which in turn could cost the president support among Republicans who were allies on the fast-track issue. Also, many conservatives oppose giving Mr. Obama any big accomplishment. And anti-trade talk from presidential candidates \u2014 the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, called it \u201ca terrible deal\u201d on Twitter on Monday \u2014 most likely will embolden the conservatives.Among Democrats, too, opposition from the presidential arena is certain to bleed into debate over the Pacific pact.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is running for the Democrats\u2019 2016 nomination, began a fund-raising appeal within hours of the deal\u2019s announcement. \u201cWall Street and big corporations just won a big victory to advance a disastrous trade deal,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNow it\u2019s on us to stop it from becoming law.\u201dThe pressure now builds on Hillary Rodham Clinton to take a stand. She promoted the trade talks as Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, but as a presidential candidate she has expressed enough wariness before liberal audiences that her support for an agreement is widely in doubt.The Pacific accord would phase out thousands of import tariffs as well as other barriers to international trade, like Japanese regulations that keep out some American-made autos and trucks. It also would establish uniform rules on corporations\u2019 intellectual property, and open the Internet even in communist Vietnam.By law, Congress will have months to deliberate, perhaps to next April. Mr. Froman said he did not know when Mr. Obama would officially notify Congress that he intends to sign the accord, but once he does, that notice will give Congress 90 days to first consider it. Additional time most likely will be needed, congressional and administration officials said.The administration wasted no time beginning its campaign for approval. Mr. Froman flew back to Washington as soon as he and the other trade officials announced their agreement to start reaching out to Congress, as well as to interest groups and industries that afternoon.Key members of Congress in both parties and interest groups influential in Washington expressed ambivalence at best or outright opposition, though the agreement\u2019s 30-chapter text will not be available for perhaps a month.The Ford Motor Company quickly condemned the agreement, saying in a statement that it would not meaningfully address currency manipulation by American trading partners, like Japan, that has the effect of lowering prices for their exports to the United States.\u201cTo ensure the future competitiveness of American manufacturing, we recommend Congress not approve T.P.P. in its current form,\u201d the Detroit automaker said.Representative Sander Levin, a congressman from Detroit and a point man on trade for his party as ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, released an ambiguous statement that also cited a continued concern over currency policies \u2014 one shared by scores of lawmakers \u2014 and disappointment that the agreement did not do more to force Mexico to allow truly independent unions.In Atlanta, Australia\u2019s trade minister, Andrew Robb, implied the weakness of the currency language when he labeled the side agreement a set of principles \u201cthat have been more or less agreed.\u201dThe entire trade agreement came together only at 5 a.m. Monday, after five days and sleepless nights of tense haggling secluded in an Atlanta hotel. When the 11 men and one woman (Magali Silva of Peru) filed onto a dais in a hotel ballroom several hours later to meet reporters, scores of aides burst into applause, and some ministers joined in.Mr. Froman read their joint statement that hailed a \u201chistoric agreement.\u201d But the ad-libbed comments of several ministers \u2014 including those from New Zealand and Canada, who hours earlier had been at the center of a final, heated standoff over dairy exports \u2014 attested to a shared sense of accomplishment. (Other parties to the Pacific pact are Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.)Canada\u2019s minister, Ed Fast, who had to negotiate just weeks before federal elections in his country, with anti-trade critics on the attack, conceded there had been \u201cvery tough discussions.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cat the end of the day, here we are as 12 T.P.P. partners, having achieved something that at times many people didn\u2019t think was achievable.\u201dTim Groser of New Zealand, a small nation that is a major dairy exporter and would gain new access to markets in Canada, the United States and elsewhere, interjected, \u201cLook, long after the details of this negotiation on things like tons of butter have been regarded as a footnote in history, the bigger picture of what we\u2019ve achieved today will be what remains.\u201dThe ministers confirmed that one of the most challenging issues was dealing with so-called biologics, which are advanced medicines made from living organisms. The United States sought up to 12 years\u2019 protection for drug makers to withhold data needed to produce generic \u201cbiosimilars,\u201d as an incentive for their innovations, while Australia and Peru led most other nations in fighting for no more than five years of protection.The compromise set a mandatory minimum of five years, without setting a maximum, leaving both sides to declare victory. \u201cWe do think we have a balanced result,\u201d said Ms. Silva of Peru.But that compromise raised questions from a significant source, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade. Mr. Hatch had shepherded fast track through the Senate, but has demanded no compromise on the American position protecting pharmaceutical giants.The decision to bar tobacco companies from using the deal\u2019s dispute resolution tribunals to challenge antismoking law may cost the accord support among Republican lawmakers from tobacco states.But without those compromises, a final accord may not have been possible.Only by dawn had negotiators settled on expanding access to dairy and sugar markets, especially in the United States and Canada. Also in final days, the United States and Japan agreed to long periods before American tariffs on Japanese vehicles sold in this country are phased out \u2014 30 years for trucks, 25 for autos, and up to 15 years for some auto parts.David M.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Steve Jobs,\u2019 Apple\u2019s Visionary C.E.O. Dissected", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWho are you? What do you do?\u201dThose questions, put to Steve Jobs by his erstwhile partner Steve Wozniak in the middle of a heated argument, are both practical and rhetorical. Jobs is not a designer, an engineer or a coder \u2014 he relies on other people to do all of that, among them his \u201clittle buddy\u201d Woz \u2014 but he has somehow risen to the top of the computer business. That doesn\u2019t quite seem fair.The fact that Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, in the course of his rise, has betrayed his friends, alienated his allies and mistreated his loved ones challenges some deeply cherished myths about the correlation between virtue and success. Jobs\u2019s behavior also confirms equally deep assumptions about the ultimate virtue of ruthlessness in the capitalist economy. He\u2019s heroic and despicable. He inspires loyalty and resentment, often from the same people. A cold rationalist who is certain he knows what the public wants, Jobs remains a mystery to those who know him best, and a brilliant, steely-eyed enigma at the center of the new movie that bears his name.The accuracy of this portrait is not my concern. Cinematic biographies of the famous are not documentaries. They are allegories: narrative vessels into which meanings and morals are packed like raisins in an oatmeal cookie; modern, secular equivalents of medieval lives of the saints; cautionary tales and beacons of aspiration. \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is a rich and potent document of the times, an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival. The movie burnishes the image of this visionary C.E.O. even as it tries to peek behind the curtain at the gimcrack machinery of omnipotence. Mostly, though, it is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting. Michael Fassbender is in it. Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels, too. Also Seth Rogen and Michael Stuhlbarg. They are all, as you might expect, really good. That should be enough.But of course there\u2019s more. Jobs was a minimalist and a control freak, a proponent of closed systems, streamlined construction and conceptual simplicity. Mr. Boyle and Mr. Sorkin, in contrast, are fervent maximalists, prone, respectively, to busy, breakneck visual effects and roiling torrents of verbiage. The collision of their styles is fascinating and sometimes disorienting to watch. The usual Sorkinian rhythms \u2014 walk and talk; stand and shout; quip and parry \u2014 are sped up and syncopated by Mr. Boyle\u2019s tireless kineticism.At times the camera seems agitated to the point of distraction because it\u2019s trapped in a movie that consists almost entirely of rushed conversations in enclosed spaces. But this antsiness helps create an atmosphere of nervous, almost absurd suspense. (Daniel Pemberton\u2019s score contributes a lot to this feeling). You hold your breath waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen, even though you know exactly what is in store. A guy is going to come out onstage and show you a new gadget. Maybe one you bought when you were younger and got rid of a long time ago.The best thing about \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d the thing that makes it work as both tribute and critique, is how messy it is. It sprawls, it sags, it grinds its gears and at times almost crashes from frantic multitasking. And yet the result is not chaos but coherence. Rejecting both linear chronology and the frame-and-flashback template of most movie biographies, Mr. Sorkin concentrates on three crucial moments in Jobs\u2019s career. Though there are a few glances into the past, most of the action unfolds in the anxious minutes leading up to a product launch. The products are not the newest, the most successful or the best known. And the man presenting them is sometimes a clean-shaven yuppie in a bow tie and a double-breasted blazer, rather than the bestubbled, mock-turtlenecked guru we think we remember.We first meet Jobs (Mr. Fassbender) in Cupertino, Calif., in 1984, as he prepares to show the world the first Macintosh personal computer. Five years later, having been forced out of Apple, he is in San Francisco to introduce NeXT, an expensive computer aimed at the educational market. Finally, having returned to Apple, he rolls out the iMac. Everything else \u2014 the laptops, cellphones, tablets and MP3 players, the retail stores and subscription services \u2014 is still on the horizon.Each chapter is built around a series of encounters with the same handful of people. His near-constant companion is Joanna Hoffman (Ms. Winslet), a marketing executive who describes herself at one point as Jobs\u2019s \u201cwork wife.\u201d A scant presence in Mr. Isaacson\u2019s book, Hoffman is the film\u2019s most obviously Sorkinesque figure, a cousin to Allison Janney\u2019s C. J. Cregg on \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and Emily Mortimer\u2019s MacKenzie McHale on \u201cThe Newsroom.\u201d Unswervingly devoted to her boss, she is his screwball sparring partner and the manager of his ego. Her ambition is tethered to his, her intelligence the polished mirror of his incandescent brilliance.Hoffman is a facilitator and explicator of drama, rather than a dramatic principal. Jobs\u2019s foils are Wozniak (Mr. Rogen) \u2014 the Fozzie Bear to his Kermit \u2014 and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), who came from Pepsi to Apple and serves as Jobs\u2019s link to the corporate world. Woz is a beloved, rivalrous sibling and Sculley a surrogate father, but Jobs continually denies the psychological complexities of the relationships, insisting that it\u2019s all about business.When it comes to his daughter Lisa (played successively, and beautifully, by Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine), he tries at first to deny his paternity altogether. Lisa\u2019s mother, Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston), is portrayed as needy and unstable, while Lisa herself is, so to speak, an apple that fell close to the paternal tree. She is not in the movie to humanize him \u2014 Jobs\u2019s wife and other children are not in the movie at all \u2014 but rather to help us measure, by means of a dramatically necessary shorthand, just how complicated he is.In his script for \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d David Fincher\u2019s brooding fantasia about Mark Zuckerberg and the founding of Facebook, Mr. Sorkin simplified the protagonist, locating the supposed source of Zuckerberg\u2019s inspiration in romantic frustration and status anxiety. \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d a less perfect movie, is nonetheless a more credible character study, and it leaves behind a fascinating residue of ambivalence.Jobs\u2019s vision of computing for the masses \u2014 not just what he calls the \u201chackers and hobbyists\u201d who dominated the market in the \u201980s \u2014 was at once democratic and totalitarian. His understanding of human desires, of consumers as well as co-workers, was both empathetic and chillingly instrumental. \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is a creation myth written by a skeptic. Whether or not we worship Steve Jobs, the world most of us live in is the one he made.\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Grown-up Aaron Sorkin dialogue: crisp, sour, rotten and delicious.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon\u00a0Valley\u2019s New Philanthropy", "Date": "2015-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 THE enduring credo of Silicon Valley is that innovation, not money, is its guiding purpose and that world-changing technology is its true measure of worth.Wealth is treated as a pleasant byproduct, a bit like weight loss after rugged adventure travel.The tech world is home to some of the planet\u2019s wealthiest entrepreneurs and most dynamic philanthropists, 21st-century heirs to Carnegie and Rockefeller who say they can apply the same ingenuity and zeal that made them rich to making the rest of the world less poor. San Francisco also has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the nation, with the wealth distortion most concentrated among the very people who are driving the economy as a whole.A similar paradox seeps into philanthropy. Tech entrepreneurs believe their charitable giving is bolder, bigger and more data-driven than anywhere else \u2014 and in many ways it is. But despite their flair for disruption, these philanthropists are no more interested in radical change than their more conservative predecessors. They don\u2019t lobby for the redistribution of wealth; instead, they see poverty and inequality as an engineering problem, and the solution is their own brain power, not a tithe.Increasingly, though, idealistic tech leaders find themselves giving back to a world that complains that they took too much in the first place. The skepticism is all the more wounding because some tech luminaries ardently believe their businesses can solve social ills.Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, a real estate heiress and the wife of Mr. Andreessen, teaches a course on philanthropy at Stanford and is the muse of Silicon Valley munificence.But second-guessing in Silicon Valley is a pesky inevitability. As Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, put it at a Vanity Fair tech conference in San Francisco in October, \u201cBasically, everything impactful you want to do has some controversy.\u201dThose may not be such big distinctions. \u201cThere is a bit of delusion in Silicon Valley that they are not like the other rich because their technology is \u2018making the world a better place,\u2019 \u201d said Steve Hilton, a former aide to Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and a co-founder of Crowdpac.com, a political start-up. \u201cBut McDonald\u2019s and Walmart also think that their businesses help society. Walmart says it lowers the cost of living for poor families. All corporations think they are having a positive impact.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg donates to causes like the Newark school project and other experiments in education reform through the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, one of the wealthiest foundations in the nation; much of the money it manages is given by tech entrepreneurs who save on taxes by making large donations on the eve of selling their companies or going public.\u201cWest Coast philanthropy is marked by innovation, it\u2019s about disruption, it\u2019s about change,\u201d said Emmett D. Carson, the foundation\u2019s chief executive. These donors \u201cbring this go-big or go-home willingness to fail, and see failure as a good outcome if you learned something.\u201dMichael Birch, a tech entrepreneur and philanthropist who owns a chic private club, the Battery, added a giving circle this year for members who want to research causes before making donations. \u201cIt\u2019s the Silicon Valley way to question the way things are done and see if they can be done differently,\u201d he said.Bill Gates set the tone in 2000; his foundation now has a $41.3 billion endowment \u2014 far more than the Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford foundations combined.\u201cThe techno-utopianism of hackers has already transformed our lives,\u201d Mr. Parker wrote. \u201cBut the greatest contribution that hackers make to society may be yet to come \u2014 if we are willing to retain the intellectual and creative spirit that got us this far.\u201dBack home, happiness is in the eye of the beholder. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of giving and impact investment and caring, but those people are not looking to change the fundamental rules of how power operates,\u201d said Michael Gast, a consultant for social justice nonprofits in Oakland.The disaffection isn\u2019t merely manifested in a few protesters blocking Google shuttle buses or in Tesla-hating, or in labor unions fighting the \u201csharing economy.\u201d Nor is it just the economists who complain that tech companies like Google and Facebook are monopolies \u2014 the Standard Oils of the moment.And the transformative power of Silicon Valley is slapped down by one of its own in \u201cGeek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change From the Cult of Technology,\u201d written by a Microsoft apostate, Kentaro Toyama.Rob Reich, a political-science professor at Stanford who is also a co-director of the Stanford Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society, notes that the tax deduction that comes with a billionaire\u2019s grant to charter schools is essentially money that won\u2019t be spent on public schools, calling Silicon Valley largess \u201can exercise of power that is unaccountable, nontransparent and tax-subsidized.\u201dWhile tech titans champion efforts to strengthen the social safety net for the most disadvantaged, many express less concern for the stagnating middle class. Alec Ross, who was an innovation adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was secretary of state and is the author of \u201cThe Industries of the Future,\u201d notes that entrepreneurs privately complain about workers, skilled and unskilled, who haven\u2019t kept pace with the new tech-based economy.\u201cYou hear derision for the working- and middle-class people who think that their education ends at the age of 22,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cPeople who want their work to stay the same without doing anything to improve themselves.\u201dNor is there much talk in these circles about taxing the rich to even the playing field. A few tech billionaires like Reed Hastings, a Netflix founder, have said they support raising taxes on the wealthy. There are many more who don\u2019t publicly oppose a tax increase but feel they are paying plenty already. There is also a libertarian streak in parts of Silicon Valley that allows some to believe they can spend their tax dollars better than the government ever will.There are, of course, some in Silicon Valley who blend tech savoir faire with old-school Carnegie-style philanthropy.Marc Benioff (net worth: $4.1 billion), a native San Franciscan who founded Salesforce, has personally given $250 million to the San Francisco children\u2019s hospital that bears his name. His company also lavishes grants, employee time and its cloud computing products on many nonprofits, including San Francisco\u2019s troubled public schools \u2014 and Mr. Benioff, unlike many reform-minded tech benefactors, lets the principals decide how to spend his money.That\u2019s a lesson that Mr. Zuckerberg learned as well. Last year, he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, quietly announced another $120 million donation to underserved public schools in the Bay Area. They haven\u2019t given up on spreading their own vision for education, however: In October, they announced that next year they would open a free private school, \u201cThe Primary School,\u201d for poor students in East Palo Alto, a struggling neighborhood a few miles away from Facebook headquarters.MR. Carson of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation says his donors are not radically rethinking how to allocate their money. \u201cPoverty is still poverty, education is still education,\u201d he says. Nor does he see the kind of shift in emphasis like the one that in June led the Ford Foundation to announce it was redirecting all its grants to address income inequality.\u201cWest Coast philanthropy is not influenced by East Coast pronouncements,\u201d Mr. Carson said dryly.In many parts of the Bay Area, the deep philanthropic reach of entrepreneurs, corporations, foundations and impact investment firms feels like a billowy duvet of solidarity and support. In others, though, it\u2019s more like a fitted queen sheet buckling at the corner of a king-size bed.For every public school in the Oakland area that is lavished with iPads by Facebook and mentored by volunteers from Salesforce or Zynga, there is one that slips through the tech benevolence net.There are no KidsCanCode banners in the halls of Garfield Elementary School in an un-gentrified part of the city. Garfield parents are mostly poor immigrants working for minimum wage or less. Fewer than half have the Internet at home.Garfield has laptops for students \u2014 10 per class \u2014 bought with school funds and locked in blue metal boxes like plutonium; last year the school won a $60,000 grant from a local family foundation (ice cream, not tech) to help pay for I.T. support and teacher training.In the hallways of Garfield, Silicon Valley seems as far away as Paris. \u201cWe do kind of marvel that we are so close to Apple and we\u2019re not in the pipeline even for used computers,\u201d said Leslie McLean, a reading teacher.On the other side of the Bay Bridge, power brokers still have faith that technology can spread the wealth and span social divides. \u201cWe see the future today,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cYou all see the future tomorrow.\u201dA news analysis article about Silicon Valley\u2019s philanthropy last Sunday misspelled the surname of the wife of Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. She is Priscilla Chan, not Chin. It also misspelled the surname of one of the founders of Facebook. He is Dustin Moskovitz, not Moskowitz.Alessandra Stanley is a reporter for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionEVERY so often, you hear grotesquely wealthy American chief executives announce in sanctimonious tones the intention to use their accumulated hundreds of millions, or billions, \u201cto lift people out of poverty.\u201d Sometimes they are referring to Africans, but sometimes they are referring to Americans. And here\u2019s the funny thing about that: In most cases, they have made their fortunes by impoverishing whole American communities, having outsourced their manufacturing to China or India, Vietnam or Mexico.No, oddly enough, China has been enriched by American-supplied jobs, making most of the destined-for-the-dump merchandise you find on store shelves all over America, every piece of plastic you can name, as well as Apple products, Barbie dolls or Nike LeBron basketball shoes retailed in the United States for up to $320 a pair. \u201cThe uplifting of impoverished people\u201d was one of the reasons Phil Knight, Nike\u2019s co-founder, gave in 1998 for moving his factories out of the United States.The Chinese success, helped by American investment, is perhaps not astonishing after all; it has coincided with a large number of Americans\u2019 being put out of work and plunged into poverty.In a wish to get to grips with local mystagogies and obfuscations I have spent the past three years traveling in the Deep South, usually on back roads, mainly in the smaller towns, in the same spirit of inquiry that vitalized me on journeys in China and Africa and elsewhere. Yes, I saw the magnolia blossoms, the battlefields of the Civil War, the antebellum mansions of superfluous amplitude; the catfish farms and the cotton fields and the blues bars; attended the gun shows and the church services and the football games.But if there was one experience of the Deep South that stayed with me it was the sight of shutdown factories and towns with their hearts torn out of them, and few jobs. There are outsourcing stories all over America, but the effects are stark in the Deep South.Take a Delta town such as Hollandale, Miss. Two years ago, the entire tax base of this community of around 3,500 was (so the now-deceased and much-mourned mayor Melvin Willis told me) less than $300,000. What the town had on hand to spend for police officers, firefighters, public works, outreach, welfare and town hall salaries was roughly the amount of a Bill or Hillary one-night-stand lecture fee; what Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, earns in a couple of days.When Hollandale\u2019s citizens lost their jobs in the cotton fields to mechanization they found work nearby, in Greenville and elsewhere, in factories that made clothes, bikes, tools and much else \u2014 for big brands like Fruit of the Loom and Schwinn.They are gone now. Across the Mississippi River, Monticello, Ark., and other towns made carpets and furniture while Forrest City produced high-quality TV sets. The people I spoke to in the town of Wynne, known for its footwear, said they\u2019d be happy to make Nikes if they were paid a living wage.I found towns in South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas that looked like towns in Zimbabwe, just as overlooked and beleaguered. It\u2019s globalization, people say. Everyone knows that, everyone moans about it. Big companies have always sought cheaper labor, moving from North to South in the United States, looking for the hungriest, the most desperate, the least organized, the most exploitable. It has been an American story. What had begun as domestic relocations went global, with such success that many C.E.O.s became self-conscious about their profits and their stupendous salaries.To me, globalization is the search for a new plantation, and cheaper labor; globalization means that, by outsourcing, it is possible to impoverish an American community to the point where it is indistinguishable from a hard-up town in the dusty heartland of a third world country.\u201cI took an assistant Treasury secretary, Cyrus Amir-Mokri, down from Memphis,\u201d William Bynum, the chief executive of the Hope Credit Union, told me in his office in Jackson, Miss. \u201cWe passed through Tunica, Mound Bayou and Clarksdale, and ended up in Utica. All through the Delta. He just sat and looked sad. He said he could not believe such conditions existed in the United States.\u201dNow the Delta is worse off, the bulk of its factories shut, the work sent overseas. Again, this is the same old story, but need it be so?When Mr. Cook of Apple said he was going to hand over his entire fortune to charity, he was greatly praised by most people, but not by me. It so happened that at that time I was traveling up and down Tim Cook\u2019s home state of Alabama, and all I saw were desolate towns and hollowed-out economies, where jobs had been lost to outsourcing, and education had been defunded by shortsighted politicians.Selma may have been a political success and a great symbol, but it is an economic failure; Greensboro has some effective well-wishers, but it does not look very different from the town that James Agee wrote about and Walker Evans photographed in \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,\u201d which was published in 1941; Monroeville earns some revenue from the \u201cMockingbird\u201d literary pilgrims, but it lost more than 2,000 jobs when Vanity Fair Brands downsized its operations there. The catfish industry is faltering all over the state, thanks in part to fish imported from special-relationship Asia.Mr. Cook, investor in and benefactor of China, is not only the guiding hand at Apple, but he is also on the board of Nike, which makes virtually all its products outside the United States. Mr. Knight told Michael Moore in his documentary \u201cThe Big One\u201d that Americans don\u2019t want to make shoes. But that\u2019s untrue.The other day, in an attempt at mortification, I looked at the Clinton Foundation website and saw as the leading headline, \u201cPartnership to Save Africa\u2019s Elephants.\u201d Since I had recently been in rural Arkansas, I thought: If you want to help closer to home, how about the black family farmers in the Delta, who \u2014 rebuffed by banks, trifled with by the United States Department of Agriculture, squeezed by vast corporate farms \u2014 are struggling to survive?In Brinkley, Ark., in reporting for my book, I had met Calvin King, who in 1980 founded the Arkansas Land and Farm Development Corporation, trying to reverse black land loss, improve housing and build safe communities. Had the Clinton family charity been in touch with him? \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. King said solemnly. \u201cWe have not received any funding support from the Clinton Foundation or the Global Initiative.\u201dAfter driving across the state, I asked the same question of Patricia Atkinson in Russellville. The director of the Universal Housing Development Corporation, she oversees the building and improvement of houses that are mainly lived in by the rural poor in this part of the state. \u201cIt really bothers me that Clinton does so little here,\u201d she told me. \u201cI wish he\u2019d help us. He\u2019s in Africa and India, and other people are helping in the third world and those countries. We don\u2019t see that money. Don\u2019t they realize our people need help?\u201dA bit of work has trickled in. At the edge of some Deep South cities a number of foreign car manufacturers have set up assembly plants \u2014 Mercedes-Benz outside Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Kia in West Point, Ga.; Hyundai in Montgomery, Ala.; , BMW outside Spartanburg, S.C.; and so forth. Most of the workers are nonunion, and, owing to robotics, the work force is relatively small. Still, such efforts have re-energized parts of the Deep South. None of those automakers have said that it is their intention to lift people out of poverty, or taken Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett\u2019s \u201cgiving pledge.\u201dThe strategy of getting rich on cheap labor in foreign countries while offering a sop to America\u2019s poor with charity seems to me a wicked form of indirection. If these wealthy chief executives are such visionaries, why don\u2019t they understand the simple fact that what people want is not a handout along with the uplift ditty but a decent job?Some companies have brought manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a move called \u201creshoring,\u201d but so far this is little more than a gesture. It seems obvious that executives of American companies should invest in the Deep South as they did in China. If this modest proposal seems an outrageous suggestion, to make products for Nike, Apple, Microsoft and others in the South, it is only because the American workers would have to be paid fairly. Perhaps some chief executives won\u2019t end up multibillionaires as a result, but neither will they have to provide charity to lift Americans out of poverty.Paul Theroux is an author whose latest book is \u201cDeep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jimmy Morales Is Elected New President in Guatemala", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 A political neophyte best known for playing dimwitted characters on his television comedy show won Guatemala\u2019s presidential election on Sunday as voters overwhelmingly turned their backs on the status quo.The former comedian, Jimmy Morales, led with 67.4 percent of the vote against Sandra Torres, a former first lady known for her social programs, with almost 96 percent of the vote counted. But almost half of eligible voters did not cast ballots, an even stronger message of disgust with the country\u2019s politics as usual. The election capped six tumultuous months in which a rising anticorruption citizens\u2019 movement helped bring down a president.In a short televised announcement, Mr. Morales, 46, declared victory Sunday night. \u201cWith this vote you made me president,\u201d he said. \u201cI have received a mandate, and the mandate of the people of Guatemala is to fight against the corruption that has consumed us.\u201dRunning on the slogan \u201cNot corrupt, nor a thief,\u201d Mr. Morales capitalized on his image as a political outsider, setting himself apart from an establishment tainted by corruption.In the past six months, a United Nations-backed panel of prosecutors working with the attorney general has peeled back layers of corruption, uncovering myriad schemes to siphon cash from the country\u2019s public coffers.As the list of officials and politicians accused in corruption scandals grew longer and reached higher, crowds began to assemble weekly in Guatemala City\u2019s main square to demand accountability.Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.He ran a campaign that was thin on specifics, backed by a political party founded by rightist military officers associated with Guatemala\u2019s long, brutal civil war. As Mr. Morales climbed in the polls, promising change, many in the business elite threw their support behind him, including the powerful confederation known as Cacif and the owner of Guatemala\u2019s broadcast television monopoly.\u201cI have no magic wands,\u201d Mr. Morales said last week at the campaign\u2019s end. \u201cI have nothing but a big heart swollen with love for this country.\u201dDespite his lopsided win, voters seemed less than enthusiastic about him. \u201cI voted for Jimmy because he\u2019s the least worst option,\u201d Ver\u00f3nica Cruz, 22, a homemaker, said after casting her ballot in San Lucas Sacatep\u00e9quez, a suburb of Guatemala City.\u201cI don\u2019t think much will change,\u201d she added. \u201cHopefully, there will be more money for education. We\u2019re safe here in San Lucas, but my husband works in Guatemala City, and it\u2019s very violent there.\u201dCrime and corruption are only the most visible problems besieging the economy in Guatemala. Income inequality is among the most extreme in Latin America, and almost half of the children are chronically malnourished.Mr. Morales will have to build coalitions among a deeply fractured Congress to pass any legislation. Watching his every move will be the movement that brought down Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina.As the results confirmed Mr. Morales\u2019s win, Gabriel Wer, one of the initial organizers of the anticorruption protests, sent a Twitter message: \u201cWe have a new president and we are here so that it will be transparent government. We won\u2019t be quiet this time!\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re honest, the next president cannot change our Guatemala alone,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez, an accountant. \u201cWe need to change the system before we can worry about individuals.\u201dMany people, like Alfonso Gir\u00f3n Coc, 36, an agricultural worker who did not vote, were resigned. \u201cI think Jimmy will win,\u201d he said earlier in the day. \u201cBut what difference will he make?\u201dElisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Nic Wirtz from San Lucas Sacatep\u00e9quez, Guatemala.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Be Allowed to Invest in a Lawsuit?", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureBut in a Chicago courtroom on Oct. 26, the Bug will star in a multimillion-dollar dispute that represents a new frontier in the march of global capitalism. The nominal occasion is a paternity feud between two of the Bug\u2019s corporate parents, Miller UK, the equipment manufacturer based in Cramlington, England, and Caterpillar, the American construction-equipment giant that was once Miller\u2019s biggest customer. The themes of Miller UK v. Caterpillar are classics of the intellectual-property genre: greed, betrayal, bloodlines. But Miller\u2019s method of funding its side of the production is something new. Rather than paying its lawyers out of pocket, Miller has turned to a private firm to front the money for its legal costs: the Illinois-based Arena Consulting, which is headed by two brothers, Herbert and Douglas Lichtman. If Miller loses, Arena gets nothing. If it wins, Arena will get a share of the proceeds, which could run well into the tens of millions of dollars.This new form of lawsuit funding is called litigation finance. It lies at the crossroads of two Anglo-American tendencies. The first is our litigious side, in which we celebrate our equality before the law by dragging those who have wronged us before a judge. The second is our ingenious mercantilism, as demonstrated by our penchant for turning everything from church raffles to mortgages into marketable securities to be chopped up, bundled and resold. Like the celebrity bonds backed by royalties and popularized by David Bowie during the 1990s, litigation finance represents the expansion of securitization into hitherto virgin territory. Those involved in the practice argue that it allows smaller companies like Miller to afford a day in court. Detractors worry that it could give rise to a litigation arms race, with speculative money aggravating the already high costs of the American legal system.While the amount of litigation funded by outside financiers is still relatively small, the industry \u2014 which barely existed outside personal-injury cases until the mid-2000s \u2014 is growing rapidly, driven by increasingly permissive laws, the promise of high returns and hourly billing rates that run $500 or more for the largest and most sophisticated law firms. Between 2013 and 2014, Burford Capital, a public company traded in Britain, increased its lawsuit investments from $150 million to $500 million. During the same period, its profits rose by 89 percent, with a 61 percent net profit margin. The two-year-old Gerchen Keller, one of the industry\u2019s youngest funds, manages more than $840 million. With investor-backed war chests, plaintiffs are crossing borders to find the most favorable jurisdictions, and sometimes enlisting the help of foreign governments. Like equities and mortgages, lawsuits are making a transition from a private arrangement to a fully monetized asset class. The \u2018\u2018portfolio\u2019\u2019 held by IMF Bentham, an Australia-based funder, consists of 39 cases, which the firm values at just over $2 billion. United States lawmakers are beginning to ask questions. In August, two senators from the Judiciary Committee sent letters to major funders asking them for the names of the cases they had invested in and many details of their business dealings. The letter called litigation finance a \u2018\u2018burgeoning industry\u2019\u2019 that was \u2018\u2018largely unregulated and operates with no licensing or oversight.\u2019\u2019Larger companies, even those with their own in-house counsel, are selling off pieces of lawsuits to smooth out cash flow and offload risk. Juridica Investments, a Miami-based fund with $650 million under management, specializes in working with Fortune 500 companies, which make up 80 to 85 percent of its investments, according to Richard Fields, its chief executive, who says that outside funding helps align the interests of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers with those of their clients. \u2018\u2018You want the largest recovery, in the shortest time, with the least uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 he says. Smaller companies can use litigation financing to finance growth, by using their future award as a credit line.Over the last century, many have come to see lawsuits as a means of expression, a political weapon and a powerful deterrent against those who might do wrong. And yet creating lawsuits is not the same as creating something like the Bug. Litigation is a zero-sum industry \u2014 every dollar in damages taken home by the winner, minus fees, must be wrung out of the loser. Litigation also helps shape legal precedent, defining the terms under which civil justice may be sought. It\u2019s hard to imagine how billions in outside capital won\u2019t wind up changing the justice system. The only question is how.\u2018\u2018How many people want to be changing that all day?\u2019\u2019 Ridley asked.Ridley then tapped out the other pin, climbed up into the Komatsu\u2019s cab and revved the diesel engine up to a gentle hum. He swung the yellow arm over to the Bug and positioned it within the flanges so the four holes aligned. He connected some hydraulic hoses to deliver power to the Bug\u2019s innards and tapped the two pins back in. Then, using the Bug-enhanced Komatsu, Ridley picked the bucket back up. Thanks to the Bug, it was an idiotproof process. A bright yellow safety latch tightened neatly over one of the pins. It took less than 10 seconds.Before quick couplers, operators would waste 30 minutes or more each time they wanted to switch out a bucket or other tool. Miller\u2019s first quick coupler, nicknamed the Magnificent Seven, came to market in the early 1990s, reducing that time to seven seconds. They also solved another problem. Previously, a construction company with three kinds of machines would need to buy three lines of buckets to match. Quick couplers soon created universal compatibility among product lines: A Komatsu bucket, for example, could now be slapped onto a Volvo machine.Caterpillar soon took notice. Compared with Miller, Cat is a leviathan: It\u2019s one of the 200 largest corporations in the world, with more than 100,000 employees. In 1997, according to legal filings from Miller, Cat approached a Miller executive at a trade show in Germany. The two companies began to talk about having Miller contract to supply Cat with a fully automatic coupler that the companies ultimately brought to market as the Pin Grabber Plus. Over the years, Cat (by Miller\u2019s count) bought about 27,000 of these units for resale to its own customers, generating upward of $100 million in revenue. Each generation of couplers had to mesh perfectly with the specifications of Cat\u2019s machines, so the companies\u2019 engineers exchanged technical drawings, and their executives hobnobbed over dinners in North\u00adumberland and Illinois. By 2006, Caterpillar was ordering about 10,000 Miller couplers a year. According to Miller, Caterpillar orders accounted for as much as 28 percent of its business and a larger share of its profits.Then, in the midst of the 2008 downturn, Cat, according to Miller\u2019s version of events, abruptly told Miller that its couplers would no longer be needed. Cat had designed its own coupler in-house. (Cat\u2019s filings deny that its coupler used Miller\u2019s proprietary technology and say that it was allowed to terminate its contract with Miller at any time.) Keith Miller, the company\u2019s founder, was gutted. With the loss of his largest customer, Miller earnings swung from an eight-million-pound profit to a million-pound loss. Miller took on debt and dismissed more than half of its employees.A year after Cat broke the news, Keith Miller saw its competing coupler for the first time. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t just similar,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It was a replica of ours.\u2019\u2019 Miller felt certain that the new Cat couplers made use of his company\u2019s know-how. He sued Caterpillar for breach of contract, fraud and misappropriating trade secrets. But he quickly learned what it means to sue a company as large as Cat. Caterpillar\u2019s lawyers made dozens of preliminary filings. They claimed that Miller had delivered \u2018\u2018substandard\u2019\u2019 couplers and failed to address \u2018\u2018continuity of supply\u2019\u2019 issues that it had repeatedly raised.Miller\u2019s lawyers quickly went through millions of pounds. To make it through the discovery phase of the suit would require millions more. Keith and his two siblings, who own the com\u00adpany together, mortgaged their houses and signed personal guarantees on the company\u2019s debt. But still they didn\u2019t have enough money to see their case through to court. So a contact in London introduced them to Reed Oslan, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in litigation finance.In the legal world, the Miller lawsuit is what is known as a \u2018\u2018David and Goliath\u2019\u2019 case, in which a plaintiff is so outgunned financially that it wouldn\u2019t be able to have its day in court without a lawyer willing to work on contingency or an infusion of investor cash. The Davids come in a variety of guises. Patricia Cohen, ex-wife of the billionaire hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, got a reported $1.2 million war chest from a firm called Balance Point, which specializes in funding divorce cases like hers. In 2006, 16 years after their divorce, Patricia saw a \u2018\u201860 Minutes\u2019\u2019 report on her ex-husband\u2019s business, which led her to file a lawsuit accusing Cohen of racketeering and fraud, claiming that he concealed $5.5 million during their legal proceedings. In 2014, after a string of findings and appeals, a federal judge dismissed the racketeering portion of Patricia\u2019s claim, noting that the only difference between it and other family disputes was \u2018\u2018the seemingly inexhaustible resources that each side has brought to bear,\u2019\u2019 but he allowed Patricia to continue her case against Steven for fraud and other claims. The litigious aftermath of the Cohen divorce, he noted, had persisted for twice as long as the Cohen marriage. Gerald Lefcourt, Patricia Cohen\u2019s lawyer, said that outside financing was necessary for Patricia to challenge someone with the resources of her ex-husband. \u2018\u2018The average person who has a good job making $100,000 a year is middle class, but totally shut out of the legal system,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t fight a big case. How do you do it?\u2019\u2019Terms of the deal between Miller UK and its funders have not been disclosed, but funders typically acquire the rights to 20 to 60 percent of all damages in hopes of recouping two or three times their original investment, sometimes more. This month, when Miller UK Ltd. v. Caterpillar Inc. is scheduled to reach trial in a federal court in Chicago, Miller\u2019s lawyers will ask a jury to award Miller more than $100 million. \u2018\u2018As the boss, I have to find a way forward,\u2019\u2019 Keith Miller said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re just a little business from the northeast of England. Without litigation finance, we couldn\u2019t take them on.\u2019\u2019Nevertheless, a vestigial squeamishness about investing in lawsuits made its way across the Atlantic. The first such disputes, early in the 20th century, were over contingency fees, the practice, now common, of lawyers taking on a case in exchange for a percentage of future damages. Unlike England, which still caps fees for winning solicitors, America was open to this kind of payment structure, in keeping with its frontier ethic toward credit and speculation. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit champerty, as long as funders do not act out of malice, back frivolous lawsuits or exert too much control over trial strategy.Hedge funds, banks and insurance companies have long been quietly funding the occasional lawsuit, but no major United States investment outfit in the commercial arena specialized in the practice until Juridica was founded in 2007. The industry\u2019s early growth was driven in part by the recession, which made lawyers at big companies eager to hand off risk and also increased the demand among investors for opportunities that could pay off no matter what was happening in the world\u2019s markets. Today the industry seems to have become a permanent part of the financial landscape, with shares of prominent funders trading every day on stock exchanges in London and Sydney.Anthony Sebok, a professor at Cardozo Law who advises Burford, says he sees the practice as part of a broader trend toward the financialization of the law. \u2018\u2018Why can\u2019t I promise a stranger some piece of the game?\u2019\u2019 he asked me, paraphrasing Bentham\u2019s writings. \u2018\u2018Is there something icky about it, like I\u2019m commodifying my rights? Bentham says these legal rights are our property. Why shouldn\u2019t we be able to sell them?\u2019\u2019 Jonathan Molot, a professor at Georgetown Law who serves as Burford\u2019s chief investment officer, has written that stock offerings by law firms could improve morale, lower rates and help lawyers focus on maximizing long-term profits. Like lawsuits, the firm itself should evolve into an asset. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a mistake for lawyers to hunker down and say we\u2019re different, we\u2019re excluded, we\u2019re not part of the economy,\u2019\u2019 he said.But the interests of financiers and plaintiffs are not always so well aligned. Depending on the structure of the deal and the ultimate payout, plaintiffs sometimes walk away with a few crumbs after the funders and lawyers take their share. One such outcome happened in 2007, when Altitude Capital, a funder, invested $8 million in an intellectual-property suit filed by DeepNines, a small network security company, against McAfee, a much larger competitor. The case was settled for $25 million, but after expenses ($2.1 million), lawyers\u2019 fees (roughly $11 million) and Altitude\u2019s cut ($10 million), DeepNines took home $800,000, a little over 3 percent of its settlement. Then, Altitude questioned DeepNines\u2019 math, arguing that the company shouldn\u2019t have deducted its own expenses before calculating contingency fees. It sued its former partner for $5 million more, eventually dropping the suit in 2011.This kind of falling out is unusual, but it shows the fundamental conflict that can occur. When it\u2019s time to divvy up the prizes, allies can turn into competitors, and smaller, inexperienced plaintiffs can find themselves facing down a second Goliath \u2014 their former champion.Lisa Rickard, the institute\u2019s president, calls litigation finance \u2018\u2018the biggest single threat to the integrity of our justice system.\u2019\u2019 As evidence, she put me in touch with Howard Schrader, a lawyer for Ace Limited, a $35 billion insurance company engaged in a multifront legal battle over a grievance dating back to the Liberian Civil War of 1991. At its root was the question of whether a Liberian company run by Lebanese nationals was due an insurance settlement over a looted supermarket, or whether the damage fell under a war-risk exclusion in its insurance policy that ruled out \u2018\u2018insurrection.\u2019\u2019 The plaintiff was a Liberian official, represented by a lawyer from the British Virgin Islands, who had found outside investors and sued in a Cayman Islands court to enforce a Liberian judgment. Schrader spent more than an hour speaking with me by phone, dutifully walking me through the case and peeling back mind-numbing layers of acquisitions, indemnity agreements, receiverships and jurisdictional disputes. To Rickard, the Ace Limited case was an example of buccaneering funders tracking down far-flung plaintiffs to pick at old wounds. I wasn\u2019t so sure. On one hand, a giant Swiss insurance company felt it was being shaken down. On the other, a small business felt it was due something for paying years of premiums. I had trouble feeling too sorry for either.In another long-running legal battle, which began in Ecuador and has since spread to several other jurisdictions, Steven Donziger, a Harvard Law School-educated lawyer, has pursued Chevron with an Ahab-like single-mindedness. He has donned the hats of advocate, adviser and ad hoc fund-raiser for some 30,000 indigenous Ecuadorians who live around the Lago Agrio area and claim that Texaco, which Chevron acquired, left contaminated waste pits around old oil-drilling sites on their land. In 2010, after the case had gone on for 19 years and Donziger\u2019s team had gone through $7 million, Burford bought in. They invested $4 million, with another $11 million planned. In exchange for its support, Burford would receive 5.5 percent of the settlement, which could work out to a 100-to-1 jackpot should Chevron pay $27 billion in damages, an ambitious sum calculated by a court-appointed expert.Chevron went on offense, digging up outtakes from a documentary in which Donziger extols the suit as an act of \u2018\u2018brute force\u2019\u2019 and the purpose of plaintiffs\u2019 law as \u2018\u2018to make [expletive] money.\u2019\u2019 (Donziger has said that these excerpts are \u2018\u2018grossly misleading or lacking in context.\u2019\u2019)In September 2011, Burford sent Donziger a letter ending their relationship. They accused his team of \u2018\u2018fraudulent conduct\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018deception,\u2019\u2019 citing Donziger\u2019s communications with the supposedly impartial expert who had come up with the $27 billion settlement figure. Burford said that consultants working with Donziger\u2019s team had \u2018\u2018ghost written\u2019\u2019 the expert\u2019s report and \u2018\u2018worked very hard to cover that up.\u2019\u2019 Donziger, meanwhile, has continued his crusade against Chevron in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. \u2018\u2018You cannot sustain this kind of case without money, and a lot of money,\u2019\u2019 Donziger said in 2010. You can imagine Chevron\u2019s being more inclined to settle had Donziger taken a less ambitious approach. Considering that scenario, it\u2019s arguable that Burford\u2019s investment could have been part of what has kept those 30,000 Ecuadorians \u2014 Donziger\u2019s clients \u2014 from receiving one penny in damages, more than 20 years after Texaco left their area. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that Donziger could not continue to pursue Chevron in the United States. Donziger has appealed and continues his foreign lawsuits. Chevron calls the case against the company \u2018\u2018the legal fraud of the century.\u2019\u2019Not long ago I had breakfast with Christopher Bogart, Burford\u2019s C.E.O. He is in early middle age, and his well-tended appearance and subtly asymmetric eyeglasses signal prosperity. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve done more than 100 deals,\u2019\u2019 he said, speaking of the Chevron case. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t had another one that\u2019s gone that way.\u2019\u2019 Burford, Bogart told me, never anticipated a $27 billion payout. \u2018\u2018We believed that Chevron would settle for much less than that,\u2019\u2019 he said, perhaps $1 billion, a more modest 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 win.\u2018\u2018The case illustrates something that I think all lawyers know,\u2019\u2019 he continued. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t always get all of the facts from your client.\u2019\u2019 His tone was somewhere between resignation and remorse, like a banker who had made a bad bet.Of course, the transformation of legal disputes into deals didn\u2019t begin with litigation finance. For years, observers of the legal profession have criticized how the market economy erodes its ethical obligations, pushing private advantage over public good and billable hours above all. Only the truly rich can afford to hire a professional who will zealously and exhaustively defend their interests. When litigation financiers talk about expanding access to justice and standing up for the little guy, they generally mean helping millionaires pursue claims against billionaires. In some ways, the rise of litigation finance is a symptom of what the American civil-justice system has become \u2014 a slow, expensive and complicated system for mediating corporate breakups. The judges in this system might talk like referees, but their function is moving toward that of accountants.\u2018\u2018All we want to do is set the record straight about what happened and why,\u2019\u2019 he told me.An initial skirmish in Miller v. Caterpillar involved a major question for litigation finance as a whole \u2014 should plaintiffs be forced to disclose their funding arrangements, or are they entitled to keep these deals confidential? Lisa Rickard, from the Institute for Legal Reform, argues in favor of disclosure. \u2018\u2018That helps the judge and the defendant understand who\u2019s pulling the strings,\u2019\u2019 she told me.Judge Jeffrey Cole, who is presiding over the Miller case, disagreed.

{"Headline": "You\u2019re Not Supposed to Understand the Federal Reserve", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyImagine if aliens in a spacecraft were studying the United States from above. Their conclusion, I expect, would be that the single most important decision these inscrutable humans make each year is whether to plant corn, soybeans or wheat. No decision, year after year, transforms more square miles of American land than the choice farmers make about which crops to grow. In some years, those aliens would see huge swaths of tight green rows of soybean; in others, more tall corn with yellow tufts; in others, an unusual abundance of wheat in, well, amber waves. Earlier this month, Rick Stern, who farms 1,500 acres in central New Jersey with his father, told me that he had just spent weeks making this very decision. He carefully studied the global market reports to learn about recent yields in Argentina and Brazil, America\u2019s leading rivals for soybean exports. He grew up watching his father and grandfather face the same dilemma each fall, using as much information as they could scrape together.But this year, there\u2019s another variable that everyone is talking about \u2014 a factor that Stern doesn\u2019t quite understand but knows will have a huge impact on the commercial grain business: whether, or when, the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Stern knows that the Federal Reserve is a powerful group of people who make decisions in Washington, but he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it works. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s something I\u2019ll never be privy to,\u2019\u2019 he told me, standing in a field of soybeans, in front of his enormous combine (\u2018\u2018It\u2019s like a rocket ship with wheels,\u2019\u2019 said my son, amazed). \u2018\u2018I just know their decision affects everybody.\u2019\u2019Here\u2019s what Stern does know: If the Fed raises rates, it would be bad for farmers like him. It would strengthen the dollar against the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, which in turn would mean that importers in China, Vietnam and the Middle East would buy more from South America and less from him. He also knows a rate increase would make it more expensive to borrow money to upgrade his equipment. He points out that his combine is 10 years old: If it broke down and he had to replace it, higher interest rates would make that enormous purchase significantly more costly to finance.Over all, Stern has learned, a Fed rate increase \u2014 and there will possibly be one before the end of the year \u2014 will mean more acres of corn and fewer of soybeans, because American farmers won\u2019t be able to rely as much on export markets to sell corn. It also means Stern will pay more attention to the few acres he has set aside for specialty crops, like watermelon, cantaloupe, tomatoes and hay. These he grows for local sale, so a stronger dollar won\u2019t affect them. He just wishes the Fed would leave rates alone, and he can\u2019t understand why they would even consider raising them. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s politics,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Most politicians forget who they are and why they went to Washington.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s almost as if the Fed were designed to confound explanation of it, precisely so the Rick Sterns of the world could never hope to influence it. Aristotle, in his \u2018\u2018Poetics,\u2019\u2019 described a formula for emotionally engaging drama that screenwriters still consult to this day, with central characters and a plot that moves from a beginning through a climax to resolution. Presidential elections can be molded into this Aristotelian structure perfectly, as can many major news stories. The Fed, by contrast, seems more like somebody sat down with a copy of \u2018\u2018Poetics\u2019\u2019 and carefully constructed its opposite. There is no beginning to Fed action; it\u2019s always there, always acting, even when its action is to not make any changes. There is no natural climax. It\u2019s just an ongoing conference between a group of economists. And it is never resolved. There is no single moment when the Fed is done.Eight times a year, usually on a Wednesday, always precisely at 2 p.m., the Federal Reserve makes an announcement. Its crucial Open Market Committee has just wrapped a meeting and chosen one of three options lettered A, B and C: whether to raise, lower or leave unchanged one specific type of interest rate, namely the interest that banks charge one another to borrow money for one day. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the main power that the Fed has over all our lives. But it\u2019s a key power, because that overnight borrowing is one of the least risky activities in our economy. When that activity is made more costly, all other risks people might want to take are made more costly, too, and so banks and businesses and people take fewer risks: They make fewer investments, lend less money. There is less economic activity everywhere.Journalists try to personify the Fed by talking about its chairperson \u2014 a role filled since February of last year by Janet Yellen \u2014 as if she had all the power. In truth, the Federal Reserve System is so enormous and diffuse that there is only a minimal center of gravity. Aldrich created this system deliberately, because he didn\u2019t want there to be any single point of power and influence, any single protagonist who could be swayed one way or another. If someone wanted to take control of the Fed, she would need the president to fire the governors he appoints (though it\u2019s not even clear he has that authority), Congress to impeach the chairwoman and each of the 12 independent boards to fire their regional bank presidents. This diffuse system does not eliminate unfair influence; the banking industry certainly has far more influence than any other. But it does mean it\u2019s extremely hard for the Fed to make decisions designed to benefit one interest group over the rest.Interestingly, a previous chairman, Alan Greenspan, cast himself for a time in the role of protagonist, single-\u00adhandedly driving the action forward. He clearly didn\u2019t read about the inevitable destiny of the tragic hero; after decades of being revered around the world, he saw his hubris lead to the near collapse of the entire global economy. (Lin-\u00adManuel Miranda, please call me; I just got a really good idea for your next hip-hop musical.) Greenspan\u2019s successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, have reverted to the Fed norm of trying to be the human embodiment of an Excel spreadsheet: gray, data-driven, personality-less, passion-free decision makers.If the Fed added up all the ways a rate increase helped people in the short term and subtracted all the ways it hurt them, they would never raise rates. While there are winners and losers, on balance a Fed rate increase means the economy will slow down, which on average is worse for everybody. The entire point of a central bank like the Federal Reserve is to empower one group of people to do something as unpopular as slow the economy down. That\u2019s because, from time to time, an economy grows so fast that it leads to a bubble, inflation or both. The Fed\u2019s job is to predict when this is going to happen and stop it before it does by slowing the economy just as people feel the most excited.When the Fed eventually does raise rates, it will be covered with near hysteria. It will be on the front page of every paper, on every cable-news show. And most Americans won\u2019t understand what any of it means. Their confusion won\u2019t be helped by the media\u2019s \u2014 and their own \u2014 instinct to understand the process through single significant moments. But trying to understand the Fed that way is like trying to make sense of a long marriage, with its small daily compromises, joys and miseries, by watching one big fight or one romantic dinner.I happen to believe the Fed would be better off waiting a few months before it raises rates. But if it does raise them in December, I won\u2019t be too upset. The committee will meet again in January and again in March, and then April, and then June. At each meeting, its members can look at the latest data about the economy and then choose A, B or C. And at the next meeting they get to choose again, so any one decision doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. What matters is how those small decisions add up over a long time. That isn\u2019t the stuff of high drama. It is much more like something else: real life.Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

His second novel, \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d lit up fiction in English with the exuberance of a Diwali firework. It was uniquely honored, winning both the prestigious Man Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, for the best novel in the prize\u2019s history. With his fourth novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d Rushdie, like the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice, inadvertently conjured a jinni of intolerance. The spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounced the book and called for Rushdie\u2019s murder.During his long period in hiding, Rushdie was protected by British security services but he received far from unconditional support. He was not just criticized by religious opponents; various secular politicians and commentators suggested that he\u2019d knowingly kicked a hornet\u2019s nest, and that he should have known better. There were unpleasant personal attacks. British newspapers made miserly quibbles about the cost of his police \u00adprotection.The central character of Rushdie\u2019s new novel, \u201cTwo Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights\u201d is also a man who has been cursed and then gets blamed for it. Geronimo Manezes, a Mumbai-born gardener now living in New York, has begun to levitate. This isn\u2019t the wish fulfillment of a flying dream; it threatens his livelihood and brings the increasing hostility of strangers. \u201cWhy do you imagine I consider my condition an improvement? he wanted to cry out. Why, when it has \u00adruined my life and I fear it may bring about my early death?\u201dBut Geronimo\u2019s predicament is not an isolated case. It foreshadows an era of \u201cstrangenesses,\u201d where the \u201claws which had long been accepted as the governing principles of reality had collapsed.\u201d The strangenesses \u2014 some meteorological, some natural disasters, some simply miraculous \u2014 are the prelude to a full-blown invasion of the human world by malevolent spirits from another dimension.It turns out that four evil jinn, Zabardast, Zumurrud, Ra\u2019im Blood-Drinker and Shining Ruby, have broken through the wormholes separating the world from Fairyland and are bent on causing havoc in the 21st century. The only power that can stop them is a nice female jinnia called Dunia and her human descendants: Geronimo Manezes, the British composer Hugo Casterbridge, the young Indian-American graphic novelist Jimmy Kapoor and a femme fatale called Teresa Saca. If Dunia can gather them up in time and awaken them to the power of their jinni nature, humanity might have a chance against the forces of darkness. \u201cThe seals between the Two Worlds are broken and the dark jinn ride,\u201d she tells Geronimo. \u201cYour world is in danger and because my children are everywhere I am protecting it. I\u2019m bringing them together, and together we will fight back.\u201d Well, the reader feels, it\u2019s a long shot, but it might just work.Rushdie was never a writer who tiptoed stealthily into the reader\u2019s imagination, avoiding the creaking floorboards of incredulity. He has always indulged the enchanter\u2019s power to say \u201cfiat lux\u201d and populate his fictional world with whatever he chooses. \u201cCapaciousness, inclusiveness, everything-at-once-ness, breadth, width, depth, bigness: These were the values to which a tall, long-striding, broad-\u00adshouldered man like himself should cleave,\u201d Geronimo thinks. And Rushdie has been a courageous and liberating example of someone who\u2019s consistently rejected any constraints on his imagination, aesthetic or theological.But while it\u2019s true that novels are capacious and composed of superfluities, if a book is everything it risks being a formless nothing. The new novel quickly becomes a breathless mash-up of wormholes, mythical creatures, current affairs and disquisitions on philosophy and theology. Behind its glittery encrustations, the plot resembles the bare outline for a movie about superheroes. There\u2019s a war between worlds, lightning comes out of people\u2019s fingertips and it all culminates in a blockbuster showdown between the forces of good and evil.A further conceit is that the tale is being told in the future by a civilization that has outgrown the needs of faith and religion. \u201cThis is a story from our past,\u201d its narrator tells us, \u201cfrom a time so remote that we argue, sometimes, about whether we should call it history or mythology.\u201d The narrator may be foggy on the genre and some key details of the actual story, but somehow, after over a thousand years, his recollection of Jet Li, Batman, Kim Novak, Larry Hagman and the divorce arrangements of the Wildensteins remains undimmed.Of course, complaining that Rushdie\u2019s not a naturalistic writer is like criticizing kimchi for its cabbagey funk. This invention and prolixity have been intoxicating in Rushdie novels when there\u2019s been some compelling principle at work \u2014 a distinct narrative voice, a single central character whose story is unfolded more patiently as in his previous New York novel, \u201cFury.\u201d But here the narrative sprawls; digressions and minor characters multiply. Anything can go in, so everything does. The author changes accents, cracks wise, lectures the reader on mythology. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un makes a cameo appearance; so does Al Qaeda; so do story lines by absurdist writers Beckett, Ionesco and Gogol.The book has no shortage of ideas and allusions. Dunia\u2019s children are the offspring of a liaison with the rationalist Muslim philosopher Averroes, or Ibn Rushd, whose name the author\u2019s family adopted. There\u2019s a continuing debate between Ibn Rushd and the theologian al-Ghazali about reason and religious belief. Yet the novel\u2019s physical world is thinly evoked. The strangenesses multiply, but they are hard to picture. The book seems both overpopulated and underimagined. The prose is often portentously vague.\u201cThings had reached a point at which only science fiction gave people a way of getting a handle on what the formerly real world\u2019s non-C.G.I. mundanity seemed incapable of making comprehensible.\u201d Abstraction and competing negations turn this sentence into a mystifying fog. \u201cEven though the normality of the city had been disrupted, most people hadn\u2019t been able to get their heads around it, and were still dumbfounded by the irruption of the fantastic into the quotidian.\u201d You get the idea, but what do you see?As the storytelling grows more manic, what comes through clearly \u2014 much too clearly \u2014 is the novel\u2019s controlling theme: an allegory about humanity\u2019s struggle between superstition and reason.\u201cThe battle against the jinn was a portrait of the battle within the human heart, which meant that the jinn were somehow abstractions as well as realities, and that their descent to the lower world served to show that world what had to be eradicated within itself, which was unreason itself.\u201d The book\u2019s title is a nod to \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights,\u201d but this kind of overt commentary is a long way from the \u00adauthorlessness and economy of fairy tales, which never lecture and whose bareness \u2014 envious stepmother, noble prince, dark forest \u2014 extends a more subtle invitation to the reader.The most felt things in the book are about Geronimo the gardener, lonely and aging in an unfamiliar city. He is doubly uprooted, separated both from the earth itself and the Indian birthplace that he loved. The prose quickens with specific detail when he mourns the loss of his childhood home: \u201cHe wished he had never become detached from the place he was born, wished his feet had remained planted on that beloved ground, wished he could have been happy all his life in those childhood streets, and grown into an old man there and known every paving stone, every betel-nut vendor\u2019s story, every boy selling pirated novels at traffic lights.\u201dIt\u2019s a huge relief when Geronimo finds himself back on more solid ground; it will be an ever bigger one when his author does too.TWO YEARS EIGHT MONTHS AND TWENTY-EIGHT NIGHTSBy Salman Rushdie290 pp. Random House. $28.Marcel Theroux\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cStrange Bodies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain\u2019s Unemployment Falls, and Rajoy\u2019s Prospects Rise", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in four years, according to official figures released on Thursday, lifting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s chances of winning a December general election in which joblessness is one of the critical issues.Spain\u2019s unemployment rate fell in the third quarter to 21.2 percent, from 22.4 percent in the previous quarter, according to a report from the National Statistics Institute. That brought down the number of people out of work to about 4.85 million \u2014 the lowest since mid-2011. At the peak of Spain\u2019s economic crisis, unemployment reached a record of almost 27 percent.Still, while Spain has recently been outpacing many other nations in the European Union in terms of growth and job creation, its unemployment rate remains second only to that of Greece and is twice the bloc\u2019s average.The timing of the better-than-expected unemployment data \u2014 the last quarterly report before the Dec. 20 general election \u2014 amounts to \u201ctremendous news for the government, given how serious the unemployment problem has been,\u201d said Sandalio G\u00f3mez, a professor at the IESE Business School in Spain who specializes in labor issues. However, he said, \u201cthere are still plenty of negative aspects in our economy, and I\u2019m sure opposition politicians will want to highlight those.\u201dWith unemployment one of the main election battlegrounds, the debate has also focused on the quality of Spain\u2019s recently created jobs. Spain\u2019s opposition parties have singled out reports showing rising poverty and widening income inequality as evidence of flaws in the government\u2019s overhaul of the labor market.And even as joblessness has fallen, the labor market has contracted. During the crisis, Spain witnessed an exodus of jobless Spaniards and Latin American construction workers. In addition, temporary contracts now account for a quarter of all jobs.Apolline Menut, an economist at Barclays in London, noted in a report on Thursday that two-thirds of Spain\u2019s employment increase in the third quarter involved temporary contracts, which she said \u201csignals that the impact of the 2012 labor market reform has been rather limited so far, particularly in hiring incentives for permanent workers.\u201dMr. Rajoy will be hoping to follow the lead of other conservative leaders, in Britain and Portugal for example, in convincing voters that his administration has put Spain on a strong recovery course following a lengthy recession, steep public spending cuts and a European banking bailout in 2012.But according to recent opinion polls, neither Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party nor any other political force will win a majority in December. The fragmentation of Spanish politics has seen two relatively new parties, Podemos and Citizens, emerge as strong challengers.Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, said the unemployment data showed \u201cthere is a lot left to be done\u201d but that, nevertheless, the economy was heading in \u201cthe right direction.\u201d The minister also said this week that \u201cthis year will be the year in which the fall in unemployment will be the most important in the history of Spain,\u201d thanks to about 600,000 new jobs. Mr. de Guindos also forecast that \u201cthe quality of jobs will improve as the economy recovers.\u201dThe tourism surge helped create jobs like those of the 25 people hired on summer contracts to monitor the so-called Beach of the Cathedrals in northern Spain, where last July the regional authorities introduced a system of visitor permits in a bid to protect the beach\u2019s ancestral rock towers and caves. \u201cTourism has filled our hotels and created jobs like mine along a beach where I remember that as a child you could walk with nobody else in sight,\u201d said Iago Garc\u00eda Matanza, 30, whose job as an information officer at the beach ended on Sept. 30. \u201cBut then of course, these are just summer jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of the Vanishing Pay Raise", "Date": "2015-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisAMID the global economic turmoil and seesawing markets, millions of Americans have one overriding question: When will my pay increase arrive? The nation\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen substantially since the end of the Great Recession, sliding to 5.1 percent from 10 percent in 2009, but wages haven\u2019t accelerated upward, as many had expected.In fact, the labor market is a lot softer than a 5.1 percent jobless rate would indicate. For one thing, the percentage of Americans who are working has fallen considerably since the recession began. This disappearance of several million workers \u2014 as labor force dropouts they are not factored into the jobless rate \u2014 has meant continued labor market weakness, which goes far to explain why wage increases remain so elusive. End of story, many economists say.But work force experts assert that economists ignore many other factors that help explain America\u2019s stubborn wage stagnation. Outsourcing, offshoring and imports exert a steady downward tug on wages. Labor unions have lost considerable muscle. Many employers have embraced pay-for-performance policies that often mean nice bonuses for the few instead of across-the-board raises for the many.Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, noted, for instance, that many retailers give managers bonuses based on whether they keep their labor budgets below a designated ceiling. \u201cThey\u2019re punished to the extent they go over those budgets,\u201d Professor Cappelli said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a local manager and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Should we bump up wages,\u2019 it could really hit your bonus. Companies have done this in order to increase the incentive to hang tough on budgets, and it works.\u201dIn recent years, wage increases, before factoring in inflation, have averaged about 2 percent annually. But real, after-inflation wages have remained dismayingly flat since 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even though real wages did bump up last fall when the drop in oil prices pulled down inflation. (In a minority view, the Heritage Foundation and some other conservative groups say the bureau has underestimated wage increases.)Many economists don\u2019t expect real wages to pick up until the job market tightens further. Federal Reserve officials hoped wages would begin rising at today\u2019s 5.1 percent, but economists are increasingly saying the rate might need to fall to 4.9 percent or lower to push wages higher (although some fear that inflation will climb if the jobless rate is that low). The only time in the past four decades when after-inflation wages bounded upward was from 1998 to 2001, when the jobless rate fell below 4.5 percent.Even as business executives urge the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to prevent inflation, a move that might increase unemployment, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, says she might want to let the jobless rate fall below 5 percent. The reason: Only then might hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers or the long-term unemployed finally find jobs.Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, voiced frustration that while wages regularly rose faster than inflation in the 1950s and \u201960s, that\u2019s no longer the case. \u201cWhy is there this assumption that wages are only going to rise faster than inflation at very low unemployment?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere does that come from?\u201dEver since the Great Recession battered corporate revenues and profits, many companies have been far tougher in containing fixed costs, including labor expenses. \u201cWith the stock market\u2019s wild behavior and what we\u2019ve seen in China, companies continue to hold on to huge amounts of cash and are reluctant to increase their costs in the form of increasing wages,\u201d said Kerry Chou, a senior practice specialist at WorldatWork, a nonprofit human resources association.Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., put it another way: \u201cThere\u2019s this pervasive norm\u201d among employers \u201cthat labor costs must be held down at all costs because maximizing profits is the be-all and end-all.\u201dHe added that the \u201catomization\u201d of the American workplace \u2014 with the use of more temps, subcontractors, part-timers and on-call workers \u2014 had reduced companies\u2019 costs and workers\u2019 bargaining power.\u201cThe labor share has declined more than you would think in light of the tightening of the labor market,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist. \u201cIt suggests we\u2019re seeing a decline in worker bargaining power.\u201dAnother important trend depressing pay is that more than ever, companies are paying top dollar to star performers \u2014 whether marketing wizards or software programmers \u2014 while skimping on paying the many workers without special skills.\u201cRight now the labor market is good if you\u2019re a new graduate of Harvard or Stanford in computer science or a new economics Ph.D. or if you\u2019re coming out with a specialized skill in some health occupation,\u201d Professor Katz said. \u201cThe upper 10 percent are probably doing O.K. in the labor market, but typical workers are still facing a lot of difficulties.\u201dAs part of this embrace of pay for performance, many companies are giving raises or one-time bonuses only to their best performers, thus helping retain and attract top talent while subtly showing the door to less stellar workers.\u201cThe higher performers are attracted to and will stay with organizations that differentiate higher performers,\u201d said Ken Abosch, North American compensation practice leader for Aon Hewitt, a consulting firm. \u201cLow performers are uncomfortable working in environments that emphasize higher performance so they will sort themselves out.\u201dIn a study of 1,200 American companies, Aon Hewitt found that 25 percent overwhelmingly emphasize rewards to high performers and give far less or nothing in raises or bonuses to average or poor performers. \u201cThose 25 percent say, \u2018We\u2019re going to give 6 percent to the top performers, 1.5 percent to average performers and we\u2019re not going to give anything to below average,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Abosch said.Just 10 percent of companies give equal raises spread across the board, Mr. Abosch said. And the remaining companies do something in between \u2014 giving somewhat higher raises to top performers and somewhat less to everybody else.Notwithstanding the overall decline in worker leverage, labor efforts like the Fight for 15 and Our Walmart have succeeded in pushing employers to lift some wages. McDonald\u2019s has raised wages at its company-owned restaurants, and Walmart and Target will increase minimum pay to $10 an hour in February. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have adopted a $15 minimum wage, while Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has ordered a $15 minimum wage for New York\u2019s fast-food workers.Such efforts offer hope to those who are eager to lift wages for everyone. \u201cIf you increase the bargaining power of workers, they might say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want you just to give more pay just to the top layer,\u2019 \u201d said Linda Barrington, executive director of the Institute for Compensation Studies at Cornell University. \u201cWe want you to share the rewards more evenly.\u201dSteven Greenhouse is a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, and the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have placed prohibitive constraints on the Census Bureau, including a mandate that it spend no more on the 2020 census than it spent on the 2010 census, despite inflation, population growth and technological change.The census is not the only target. The budget for the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been flat or falling for several years, forcing the agency to end surveys on mass layoffs, international labor comparisons, and employment in alternative energy. It has had to curtail quarterly data collection on employment and wages.Unless the labor bureau\u2019s budget is increased, even the American Time Use Survey \u2014 the only government survey of how Americans spend their time outside work \u2014 may be curtailed or ended. The time-use survey, which was begun in 2003, provides the type of novel data Mr. Deaton used in his research.The list of cutbacks goes on. Budgets to compile statistics on the economy, energy and health have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2010, while budgets for statistical efforts covering agriculture, crime, education and transportation are lower in real terms now than they were five years ago.Congress\u2019s disdain for federal statistics divorces policy making from empirical evidence. Financing for federal data needs to be increased.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen U.S. Chief Knew of Potential Emissions Problems in 2014", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael Horn, the chief executive of the Volkswagen Group of America, said he was informed at the time of \u201ca possible emissions noncompliance,\u201d but was told that the company\u2019s engineers would work with the Environmental Protection Agency to resolve the issue, according to testimony prepared for a congressional hearing set for Thursday. Later that year, he said, he was told that Volkswagen\u2019s technical teams had a specific plan for bringing the vehicles into compliance.It wasn\u2019t until September 2015 that Volkswagen disclosed at a meeting with regulators that software in certain diesel vehicles contained a so-called defeat device, which effectively lowered emissions for testing purposes. The device could recognize whether a vehicle was being operated in a test laboratory or on the road and emit different levels of pollutants accordingly.The company has not provided a fix. Volkswagen faced a German government deadline of Wednesday night to submit a plan to correct the vehicles.At the hearing, Mr. Horn is expected to apologize for the company\u2019s trickery and to describe the steps it will take to investigate the episode, including finding remedies for the affected vehicles and adopting measures to prevent this from happening again.As Volkswagen works with American officials to address the issues, Mr. Horn indicated that certain features on future models still needed regulatory approval. With that process incomplete, he said the company had withdrawn the application for certification of the 2016 model vehicles.He also said that the company was examining its internal processes to make sure this kind of deception would not happen again. \u201cVolkswagen knows that we will be judged not by words, but by our actions over the coming weeks and months,\u201d said Mr. Horn.A spokeswoman for Volkswagen noted that Mr. Horn in 2014 \u201cdid not know, nor was he informed, that Volkswagen vehicles included the defeat device software.\u201d That information, said the spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan, was \u201conly revealed to Mr. Horn and to U.S. government agencies over the past several weeks.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.As the company tries to restore its battered reputation, Volkswagen is trying to limit the culpability.Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, said in an interview published on Wednesday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that only a few employees were involved in the deception. Mr. M\u00fcller added that he did not believe that his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, knew of the cheating.\u201cDo you really think that a chief executive had time for the inner functioning of engine software?\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller told the newspaper. He said Mr. Winterkorn was so busy that he visited Porsche\u2019s famed research and development center in Weissach, Germany, only once every three years.Mr. M\u00fcller did say that four people \u2014 one more than previously disclosed \u2014 had been suspended over the scandal.While Mr. M\u00fcller did not name any of the four suspended people, three names are known: Ulrich Hackenberg, Heinz-Jakob Neusser and Wolfgang Hatz. All three held top positions at Volkswagen units and have been involved in engine development.The fourth person, Mr. M\u00fcller said, is below the level of top management. Some other employees who may have been involved have already retired, he said.The notion that the issues stemmed from a small group of managers was met with skepticism outside Volkswagen and raised questions on whether the company was committed to changing a corporate culture that might have led to the scandal. And Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, which oversees Mr. M\u00fcller, appointed an insider as chairman on Wednesday.Analysts also question how top Volkswagen executives, who typically have an engineering background, could have been ignorant of technology that fundamentally affected the performance of so many vehicles. And Mr. M\u00fcller, in the interview, did not explain how top executives could have been unaware that something was amiss even after officials at the E.P.A. in the United States began raising questions last year about big discrepancies between emissions of vehicles during testing and on the road. \u201cIt seems unlikely that just a few key individuals knew about this,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales who follows the auto industry. \u201cThere are clearly problems of communication and flow of information.\u201dVolkswagen has a strong incentive to fix the cars in a way that does not affect performance or fuel economy, to defuse lawsuits from owners complaining that their cars have lost value because of the scandal.Industry experts, though, said it remained unclear how Volkswagen would satisfy drivers, who want peppy performance and good fuel economy, and regulators, who want the cars to meet pollution standards. As Mr. M\u00fcller acknowledged in the interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the cheating began after people inside Volkswagen realized that a new engine line could not comply with United States pollution limits.The decision to use illegal software took place while Volkswagen was making a transition to a new diesel technology known as common rail, Mr. M\u00fcller said. He did not say when that was, but Volkswagen began selling cars with that technology around 2008.\u201cThe transition to modern common rail motor technology took place at the same time as the decision to return to America with diesel,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said. \u201cApparently they were not successful in achieving the strict American emissions regulations.\u201dIn 2013, a nonprofit group, in conjunction with California regulators, started testing the on-road diesel emissions from cars, including Volkswagen models. They soon found that the on-the-road performance deviated starkly from the laboratory findings, publishing a study the next year. It was around that time that Mr. Horn, the American Volkswagen executive, was informed of the possible problems.As regulatory scrutiny intensified around the issue, Volkswagen fought back, trying to poke holes in the study. Nonetheless, the company in December 2014 initiated a voluntary recall to fix the issue in certain diesel models, according to the E.P.A. But it did not address the problem.For the last few weeks, Volkswagen has been dealing with fallout of the deception, affecting millions of cars and light commercial vehicles, primarily in Europe. About 480,000 are in the United States.On Wednesday, Volkswagen appointed Hans-Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, as supervisory board chairman. Mr. P\u00f6tsch, 64, is an Austrian seen as close to the Porsche family, which owns a majority stake in Volkswagen.The company also named Wolfgang Porsche, who represents the Porsche family, to lead a committee that is investigating the emissions cheating. He will work with the Jones Day law firm, which was brought in by the company to assist in the internal inquiry.Mr. P\u00f6tsch, though, warned that it would take time before the company would be ready to make findings public.Melissa Eddy and Aaron M. Kessler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sherry Turkle\u2019s \u2018Reclaiming Conversation\u2019", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Sherry Turkle is a singular voice in the discourse about technology. She\u2019s a skeptic who was once a believer, a clinical psychologist among the industry shills and the literary hand-wringers, an empiricist among the cherry-picking anecdotalists, a moderate among the extremists, a realist among the fantasists, a humanist but not a Luddite: a grown-up. She holds an endowed chair at M.I.T. and is on close collegial terms with the roboticists and affective-computing engineers who work there. Unlike Jaron Lanier, who bears the stodgy weight of being a Microsoft guy, or Evgeny Morozov, whose perspective is Belarussian, Turkle is a trusted and respected insider. As such, she serves as a kind of conscience for the tech world.Turkle\u2019s previous book, \u201cAlone \u00adTogether,\u201d was a damning report on human relationships in the digital age. By observing people\u2019s interactions with robots, and by interviewing them about their computers and phones, she charted the ways in which new technologies render older values obsolete. When we replace human caregivers with robots, or talking with texting, we begin by arguing that the replacements are \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d but end up considering them \u201cbetter than anything\u201d \u2014 cleaner, less risky, less demanding. Paralleling this shift is a growing preference for the virtual over the real. Robots don\u2019t care about people, but Turkle\u2019s subjects were shockingly quick to settle for the feeling of being cared for and, similarly, to prefer the sense of community that social media deliver, because it comes without the hazards and commitments of a real-world community. In her interviews, again and again, Turkle observed a deep disappointment with human beings, who are flawed and forgetful, needy and unpredictable, in ways that machines are wired not to be.Her new book, \u201cReclaiming Conversation,\u201d extends her critique, with less \u00ademphasis on robots and more on the dissatisfaction with technology reported by her recent interview subjects. She takes their dissatisfaction as a hopeful sign, and her book is straightforwardly a call to arms: Our rapturous submission to digital technology has led to an atrophying of human capacities like empathy and self-\u00adreflection, and the time has come to reassert ourselves, behave like adults and put technology in its place. As in \u201cAlone Together,\u201d Turkle\u2019s argument derives its power from the breadth of her research and the acuity of her psychological insight. The people she interviews have adopted new technologies in pursuit of greater control, only to feel controlled by them. The likably idealized selves that they\u2019ve created with social media leave their real selves all the more isolated. They communicate incessantly but are afraid of face-to-face conversations; they worry, often nostalgically, that they\u2019re missing out on something fundamental.Conversation is Turkle\u2019s organizing principle because so much of what constitutes humanity is threatened when we replace it with electronic communication. Conversation presupposes solitude, for example, because it\u2019s in solitude that we learn to think for ourselves and develop a stable sense of self, which is essential for taking other people as they are. (If we\u2019re unable to be separated from our smartphones, Turkle says, we consume other people \u201cin bits and pieces; it is as though we use them as spare parts to support our fragile selves.\u201d) Through the conversational attention of parents, children acquire a sense of enduring connectedness and a habit of talking about their feelings, rather than simply acting on them. (Turkle believes that regular family conversations help \u201cinoculate\u201d children against bullying.) When you speak to people in person, you\u2019re forced to recognize their full human reality, which is where empathy begins. (A recent study shows a steep decline in empathy, as measured by standard psychological tests, among college students of the smartphone generation.) And conversation carries the risk of boredom, the condition that smartphones have taught us most to fear, which is also the condition in which patience and imagination are developed.Turkle examines every aspect of conversation \u2014 with the self in solitude, with family and friends, with teachers and romantic partners, with colleagues and clients, with the larger polity \u2014 and reports on the electronic erosion of each. Facebook, Tinder, MOOCs, compulsive texting, the tyranny of office email, and shallow online social activism all come in for paddling. But the most moving and representative section of the book concerns the demise of family conversation. According to Turkle\u2019s young interviewees, the vicious circle works like this: \u201cParents give their children phones. Children can\u2019t get their parents\u2019 attention away from their phones, so children take refuge in their own devices. Then, parents use their children\u2019s absorption with phones as permission to have their own phones out as much as they wish.\u201d For Turkle, the onus lies squarely on the parents: \u201cThe most realistic way to disrupt this circle is to have parents step up to their responsibilities as mentors.\u201d She acknowledges that this can be difficult; that parents feel afraid of falling behind their children technologically; that conversation with young children takes patience and practice; that it\u2019s easier to demonstrate parental love by snapping lots of pictures and posting them to Facebook. But, unlike in \u201cAlone Together,\u201d where Turkle was content to diagnose, the tone of \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d is therapeutic and hortatory. She calls on parents to understand what\u2019s at stake in family conversations \u2014 \u201cthe development of trust and self-esteem,\u201d \u201cthe capacity for empathy, friendship and intimacy\u201d \u2014 and to recognize their own vulnerability to the enchantments of tech. \u201cAccept your vulnerability,\u201d she says. \u201cRemove the \u00adtemptation.\u201d\u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d is best appreciated as a sophisticated self-help book. It makes a compelling case that children develop better, students learn better and employees perform better when their mentors set good examples and carve out spaces for face-to-face interactions. Less compelling is Turkle\u2019s call for collective action. She believes that we can and must design technology \u201cthat demands that we use it with greater intention.\u201d She writes approvingly of a smartphone interface that \u201cinstead of encouraging us to stay connected as long as possible, would encourage us to disengage.\u201d But an interface like this would threaten almost every business model in Silicon Valley, where enormous market capitalizations are predicated on keeping consumers riveted to their devices. Turkle hopes that consumer demand, which has forced the food industry to create healthier products, might eventually force the tech industry to do the same. But the analogy is imperfect. Food companies make money by \u00adselling something essential, not by placing targeted advertising in a pork chop or by mining the data that a person provides while eating it. The analogy is also politically unsettling. Since platforms that discourage engagement are less profitable, they would have to charge a premium that only affluent, well-educated consumers of the sort that shop at Whole Foods are likely to pay.Although \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d touches on the politics of privacy and \u00adlabor-saving robots, Turkle shies from the more radical implications of her findings. When she notes that Steve Jobs forbade tablets and smartphones at the dinner table and encouraged his family to talk about books and history, or when she cites Mozart, Kafka and Picasso on the value of undistracted solitude, she\u2019s describing the habits of highly effective people. And, indeed, the family that is doing well enough to buy and read her new book may learn to limit its exposure to technology and do even better. But what of the great mass of people too anxious or lonely to resist the lure of tech, too poor or overworked to escape the vicious circles? Matthew Crawford, in \u201cThe World Beyond Your Head,\u201d contrasts the world of a \u201cpeon\u201d airport lounge \u2014 saturated in advertising, filled with mesmerizing screens \u2014 with the quiet, ad-free world of a business lounge: \u201cTo engage in playful, inventive thinking, and possibly create wealth for oneself during those idle hours spent at an airport, requires silence. But other people\u2019s minds, over in the peon lounge (or at the bus stop), can be \u00adtreated as a resource \u2014 a standing reserve of purchasing power.\u201d Our digital technologies aren\u2019t politically neutral. The young person who cannot or will not be alone, converse with family, go out with friends, attend a lecture or perform a job without monitoring her smartphone is an emblem of our economy\u2019s leechlike attachment to our very bodies. Digital technology is capitalism in hyperdrive, injecting its logic of consumption and promotion, of monetization and efficiency, into every waking minute.It\u2019s tempting to correlate the rise of \u201cdigital democracy\u201d with steeply rising levels of income inequality; to see more than just an irony. But maybe the erosion of humane values is a price that most people are willing to pay for the \u201ccostless\u201d convenience of Google, the comforts of Facebook and the reliable company of iPhones. The appeal of \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d lies in its evocation of a time, not so long ago, when conversation and privacy and nuanced debate weren\u2019t boutique luxuries. It\u2019s not Turkle\u2019s fault that her book can be read as a handbook for the privileged. She\u2019s addressing a middle class in which she herself grew up, invoking a depth of human potential that used to be widespread. But the middle, as we know, is disappearing.RECLAIMING CONVERSATIONThe Power of Talk in a Digital AgeBy Sherry Turkle 436 pp. Penguin Press. $27.95.Jonathan Franzen is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Kraus Project\u201d and the novel \u201cPurity.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: With the S600, Mercedes Revives the Maybach", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenCHANCES are you have not heard of Maybach (pronounced \u201cMY-Bahk\u201d). The brand traces its luxury lineage to 1909, with Daimler-Benz buying the brand in 1960. It lay dormant until the 2004 model year, when two cars, the 57 and 62, made their debuts at an average of $420,000 each. Timed nearly perfectly with the recession, the resurrection sank like Lehman Brothers.Maybach is now positioned as the ultraluxury subbrand of Mercedes-Benz, much as AMG is its performance label. More affordable now at $204,000 as tested, it is a bargain compared with the Rolls-Royce Ghost and the Bentley Mulsanne. Certainly, it will not be attracting Malibu and Santa Fe shoppers, unless you are talking real estate.Basically, the regal 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 is an overachieving S-Class with a wheelbase stretched nearly eight inches to aid pampering in the rear. The back of my test vehicle had massaging seats that were warmed and chilled. Infinitely adjustable down to power leg rests, Maybach is the fastest and most luxurious La-Z-Boy on the planet.Both rear positions get retractable tables akin to those in first-class air travel; you will half expect flight attendants to arrive with scotch and warm cashews. The rear seats have video screens, wireless headphones, climate control, window shades, vanity mirrors and cup holders that cool and heat. Of course, there\u2019s a refrigerator to keep the Champagne chilled. Robbe & Berking silver-plated Champagne flutes have their own storage space. Fingers on the center console grasp the vessel\u2019s base to eliminate tipping when your driver is aggressive on the way to the board meeting.That is entirely possible considering that the 6-liter biturbo V12 engine gracefully summons 523 horsepower and 612 pound-feet of torque. Imperceptible yet decisive shifts come from a 7-speed automatic transmission, with paddle shifters. The Maybach whispers from 0 to 60 miles an hour in about five seconds.This is a car to be driven in, but there\u2019s something for the pilot. It is unusually nimble and controlled for a large vehicle. Magic Body Control uses cameras to scan the road ahead for potholes, then prepares the suspension to react as the tires hit them. The ride is as serene as knowing there\u2019s 10 billion euros in the offshore account.Because the car gulped premium, the government rates its fuel economy at 13 miles per gallon in the city, 20 on the highway, even with the engine\u2019s auto start-stop feature turned on. It\u2019s on the sluggish side for impatient captains of industry. Fortunately, Jeeves can turn the start-stop feature off.Other gripes? Mounted in the center of the trunk, the refrigerator eliminates a strategic chunk of space. Mercedes\u2019s Comand interface on the console is improved with a track pad, allowing text input by writing with your fingers, but the menu remains a bit confusing.Up front, planks of flawless lumber and quilted leather soothe eyes and fingers. Fiber-optic ambience lighting snakes through the cabin. A glass roof allows panoramic views of concrete canyons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Directors Say Volkswagen Delayed Informing Them of Trickery ", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring that period, the board was completing the terms of a contract extension for the automaker\u2019s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn. He was pushed out five days after the use of the cheating device became public, though he insisted he had known nothing about it.Volkswagen has admitted that some cars were programmed to disable their pollution controls unless the software detected that emission tests were being conducted. With the controls off, the vehicles had better acceleration and fuel economy, but emitted far higher levels of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments.Events leading up to, and in the weeks that followed, the admission by Volkswagen that it had deliberately designed its diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests.If Mr. Winterkorn did not know about the communication with the American regulators, he was unaware of a fundamental threat to the company. If he was aware, he withheld significant information from members of his 20-member supervisory board.\u201cThat they were not informed about a problem of this dimension, that points to a huge communications problem,\u201d said Markus Kienle, a Frankfurt lawyer who is on the board of a shareholder-advocacy group known by its German initials SdK.Mr. Winterkorn did not respond to requests for comment Thursday and Friday. A spokesman for Volkswagen declined to comment. Stephan Weil, a board member who is also prime minister of the German state Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, said he learned of the cheating while watching television news. Babette Fr\u00f6hlich, another board member and an official with the IG Metall labor union, said she also learned of the scandal from the media. A third board member, Olaf Lies, the Lower Saxony economy minister, has said he was not informed by company officials and read about it online.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The board\u2019s executive committee, which includes Mr. Weil, had formally recommended to the full board the extension of Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s contract by three years. That recommendation was made on Sept. 2, the day before Volkswagen officials told the E.P.A. about the emissions cheating.It was a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d for Volkswagen executives to withhold information as long as they did, Mr. Weil said on Friday in a statement. He noted that American regulators had raised red flags about Volkswagen emissions in 2014. \u201cTalks took place for a full year before Volkswagen admitted the deception,\u201d Mr. Weil said. \u201cThis confession should clearly have occurred much earlier.\u201dCritics of the company previously have said that top managers in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the company is based, hoarded power while discouraging open discussion of problems. Matthias M\u00fcller, Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive, has acknowledged the flaws and promised a more open style of management, although changing a company with 600,000 employees could take years.The consequences for Volkswagen have been severe. About 11 million cars have the illegal software, mostly in Europe and the United States, and recalling or repairing them is likely to cost billions of dollars. The company faces dozens of lawsuits on both continents from shareholders and customers. Volkswagen has suspended five high-ranking executives who were involved in motor development and is conducting an inquiry.After the Environmental Protection Agency made public its accusation on Friday, Sept. 18, Mr. Winterkorn acted to quell the crisis. That Sunday, and again the next Tuesday, he publicly apologized on behalf of the company. Those moves did not save him from the angry board. The next day he was out of a job.\u201cI am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group,\u201d Mr. Winterkorn said in a statement accompanying his resignation. \u201cI am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part.\u201dSome outsiders expressed surprise that Mr. Winterkorn, known for his attention to detail, would have been unaware that E.P.A. officials had been asking for more than a year why Volkswagen diesel cars had far lower emissions in laboratory tests than on the road. \u201cI find it very improbable,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows Volkswagen closely. \u201cHe was always the one who wanted to know everything.\u201dVolkswagen initially contested findings by independent researchers and the E.P.A. in 2014 that showed big discrepancies between the pollutants that its cars generated on the road compared to lab tests. Then, on Aug. 21, 2015, at a conference in Pacific Grove, Calif., organized by the University of California, Davis, a Volkswagen official informally mentioned to a senior E.P.A. official that the company had been deceiving regulators.The revelation surprised the official, Christopher Grundler, who runs the agency\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. Standing next to him at the time was a regulator with the California Air Resources Board, according to an E.P.A. official who confirmed the events, earlier reported by Reuters.In a Sept. 3 conference call with officials from the E.P.A. and the state of California, company executives detailed how Volkswagen vehicles were programmed to trick emissions-testing equipment.An E.P.A. spokeswoman declined to identify the Volkswagen officials who have been in talks with the agency.Initially, as the scandal broke, Volkswagen\u2019s board avoided criticizing Mr. Winterkorn. When he resigned, the executive committee said in a statement that it had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for him and that he \u201chad no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Subsequently, several members expressed displeasure with Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s failure to keep them in the loop. Mr. Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, complained about it in a speech last week to the state Parliament.Volkswagen is the largest company by far in the state and employs about 110,000 people there. The state government owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, and by law has veto power over major decisions.Under German law, at least half of the seats on a company supervisory board are held by labor representatives. A spokesman for members of Volkswagen\u2019s workers\u2019 council, which is separate from the union and also has seats on the board, said he did not know how they learned of the emissions scandal and could not comment.At Volkswagen, four of the 20 board seats are held by descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the original Beetle. The family owns a majority of Volkswagen shares through a holding company. A spokesman for the holding company declined to comment.Volkswagen executives had a duty to inform the supervisory board of the emissions problem, said Ulrich Hocker, a D\u00fcsseldorf lawyer who is president of a shareholder advocacy group known by its German initials, D.S.W. But he said only the supervisory board would have legal standing to seek damages from Mr. Winterkorn, who has kept a low profile since leaving.Some shareholders have complained that Volkswagen did not follow German laws requiring it to publicize information that could affect the stock price.Mr. Hocker said shareholders are angry and want changes. \u201cThe whole company was run from Wolfsburg,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to get away from this centralized management.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sanctioning Moscow for downing a plane most Russians believe the Ukrainians shot down only makes them rally behind a leader they believe is unfairly targeted by Washington and Brussels. It has also made it easy for Moscow to blame Russia\u2019s cratering economy not on its own bad management and metastatic corruption but on unjust Western sanctions.Western Cold Warriors understood the importance of getting their own version of events to Russians, which is how Radio Free Europe and Voice of America were born. But today, those outlets are widely seen as ineffective, shrill government propaganda, even by that receptive 3 percent of westernized Russians who think that Russian-backed rebels brought down Flight 17.

{"Headline": "Pedro Passos Coelho, Who Led Austerity Plan in Portugal, Nears Re-Election", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd on Sunday, he could become the first national leader in Europe to win re-election after overseeing a painful international bailout of his country.A year ago that outcome seemed highly unlikely, but now it appears within reach: The latest opinion polls show Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s center-right coalition with a wafer-thin lead over the Socialists and other left-leaning parties.His chances have improved along with a consumer-driven economic recovery that has finally started to improve the job market in Portugal. The unemployment rate has fallen to 12 percent from a peak of 17.5 percent in early 2013.The recent turmoil in Greece has also helped Mr. Passos Coelho by raising tensions among Portugal\u2019s already fragmented left. Even if the main opposition party, the Socialists, wins the most votes on Sunday, it could struggle to form a viable governing coalition with the Communists and other left-wing parties, some of which are demanding a restructuring of Portugal\u2019s debt.Mr. Passos Coelho, 51, has campaigned largely on the argument that the country needs continuity in government to avoid derailing the economic recovery or risking another bruising confrontation with its creditors.\u201cThe images of people queuing to get their money out of Greek banks was used over and over again by the ruling coalition, and it has probably made people here more afraid about not respecting European rules,\u201d said Maria de Bel\u00e9m, a Socialist lawmaker and former minister. \u201cSo people are now going to vote with a bit of fear, and a lack of hope.\u201dThe Socialists \u2014 led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the former mayor of Lisbon \u2014 have also been stained by a former prime minister, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, who is under house arrest and awaiting formal charges linked to an investigation of fraud and tax evasion.The party lost power in the last national election in June 2011, shortly after Mr. S\u00f3crates was forced to call on international creditors to rescue Portugal from unsustainable borrowing costs. Mr. Passos Coelho became prime minister and completed the three-year bailout program on schedule in 2014.Many voters have become disillusioned. Joana Pimenta, an architect who usually backs the Socialists, said she would not vote at all this time because of \u201ca level of corruption that has even left our former prime minister in prison.\u201d She said she had never missed voting in a national election before.If she were forced to vote on Sunday, Ms. Pimenta said, it would probably be for Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s slate. \u201cThe austerity cuts have been horrible,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least he had the guts to face a problem and stick with it, however much hatred his policies generated.\u201d Turnout is expected to be low by Portuguese standards.\u201cI think that people here now realize that to get back what has been invested to repair an economy, you need a certain amount of time,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Heinermann, a German auto executive in Lisbon who heads the German-Portuguese Chamber of Commerce. \u201cPortugal could become the proof that even a government that pushes through very tough austerity measures can win re-election.\u201dMr. Passos Coelho is already the first Portuguese prime minister to lead a coalition through a full term in office since democracy was restored here in 1974 after four decades of dictatorship.There have been setbacks along the way. Some of Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s economic proposals have been blocked in court. The government has struggled to find buyers for its planned privatizations, some of which have fallen behind schedule, or for a bank that the state rescued from the collapse of the Esp\u00edrito Santo family\u2019s business empire. Saving that bank ballooned the country\u2019s 2014 budget deficit to 7.2 percent of gross domestic product, from a projected 4.5 percent.If neither side emerges with a clear governing majority on Sunday, Portugal faces \u201cthe risk of medium-term deadlock,\u201d according to a report by Antonio Barroso, an analyst in London for Teneo Intelligence, a research organization.Mariana Mort\u00e1gua, an economist and a leader of the Left Bloc party in Portugal, acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s a problem that the left hasn\u2019t been able to put forward one program and one solution.\u201d In fact, she said, \u201cthe Socialist Party hasn\u2019t offered people a credible alternative because they keep saying that they reject austerity, but at the same time they accept the fiscal rules of Europe, and don\u2019t even talk about debt restructuring.\u201dThat ambivalence has played into the governing party\u2019s hands, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the country is now in a worst position than before the crisis, and there\u2019s more poverty,\u201d Ms. Mort\u00e1gua said, but they\u2019ve managed \u2014 in a very smart way, I\u2019ve got to admit \u2014 to give the impression that austerity is a success.\u201dAmong the protest signs stacked in the Left Bloc party\u2019s headquarters was one reading, \u201cA country doesn\u2019t sell itself,\u201d a reference to the government\u2019s sale of major insurance and energy assets to Chinese and other foreign investors under pressure from Germany and other creditors.And while Portugal\u2019s property market has been revived by foreign investors who get tax breaks and special residency visas, activists on the left cite studies by Oxfam and other poverty-fighting groups that indicate that Portugal has one of the highest levels of income inequality in Europe.Going into the weekend, the election seemed too close to call, but officials of the ruling party were already pleased at having apparently shed some of the stigma of austerity.\u201cThe overwhelming opinion in the past two years was that the government would lose because you could not win with austerity measures,\u201d said Miguel Poiares Maduro, a government minister. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve now allowed people to see that their sacrifices made sense. I think the Portuguese people have understood that austerity was not a choice, but a necessity that we had to go through.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a government minister. He is Miguel Poiares Maduro, not Miguel Poiares Maduros.An article on Oct. 3 about the surprising pre-election polling strength of Pedro Passos Coelho, the Portuguese prime minister, who was for years the unpopular flag-bearer of austerity, misstated the size of Portugal\u2019s 2014 budget deficit. It was 7.2 percent of gross domestic product, not 7.5 percent.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Pedro Passos Coelho. He is the first Portuguese prime minister to lead a coalition through a full term in office since 1974, not the first to complete a full term in office since then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Alpine Antidote to Working Weekends", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WorkWhen I finished my master\u2019s in communications in 2003, I was excited to create amazing work for the American ad industry. For my entry into what was supposed to be my new and wonderful working world, I accepted a $30,000 salary. I also accepted that it was normal to work holidays and weekends \u2014 and for no additional pay. I accepted that work came before anything else.As one of the creative directors at my ad agency told me, \u201cCreatives don\u2019t take holidays.\u201dI didn\u2019t mind \u2014 at first. After all, I was working in my dream job at my dream agency. Every day I was paid to create witty lines for print advertisements, scripts for television and radio commercials, and conceptual ideas for well-known clients who were depending on my writing to make them even more famous.But after 10 months, instead of practically skipping to the office, my feet dragged. My once larger-than-life office pod felt as small as I did when I told my new husband, that no, I wouldn\u2019t be coming home for dinner again.At one point, I was working so much that the company president sent my husband a basket of pears with a note that said: \u201cSorry we\u2019ve been taking Chantal away from you so much this year. But we\u2019ve got exciting things going on at the agency.\u201dMost Friday nights, I\u2019d sulk, knowing I\u2019d have to work another weekend. Even when I didn\u2019t have to go to the agency, the lingering possibility that I might get a call meant I was never able to relax. But I convinced myself that I was doing what I needed to do to get ahead.Two years in, when I was 28, my husband got an offer to work in Switzerland. At first, I balked at the idea of moving. \u201cI finally have my dream job at my dream agency,\u201d I told him, refusing to acknowledge that I was thoroughly burned out. \u201cNo one will want an English-speaking copywriter in a German-speaking city.\u201dMy husband didn\u2019t argue. \u201cIt\u2019s your decision,\u201d he said.For some reason, the day of his decision deadline, I closed my eyes and called him.\u201cO.K. I\u2019ll go,\u201d I said.On my last day of work at the American ad agency, something strange happened: I was smiling. A weight had been lifted, and I felt like a prisoner about to be freed. And despite my fear that no one would hire me, I soon found a job in Zurich doing exactly what I had been doing in the United States: copywriting for an ad agency.My job title was the same, but I worked part time \u2014 and for a higher salary than I had received working full time in the United States. When I was politely asked to work additional days beyond the ones specifically mentioned in my contract, the agency paid me for that extra work.Not only that, but instead of two weeks of vacation, I had five. And I was encouraged to use every single day of it, guilt-free. Once, when I went to Spain for \u201conly\u201d 10 days, my Swiss colleagues chastised me for not going away long enough.Instead of worrying about working weekends and holidays the way I had in the United States, I planned trips like the rest of my colleagues: Paris. Prague. Zermatt. For the first time in my working life, I was living, too. Because of this, my creativity flourished. I had both time and money, and because I had real time off, I was more productive when I was at work. In my spare time I wrote blogs and essays and I swam in the lake.Now, after almost a decade in Switzerland, I\u2019m back in the States to take care of some family issues. I work as a freelance writer and copywriter \u2014 and also continue to work for some of my Swiss clients. But as I begin to freelance for more American companies, the desire to return to Switzerland is growing.Americans live to work \u2014 it\u2019s culturally ingrained. If we\u2019re not busy, we\u2019re not worthy. No matter how much I try to challenge American work mores, I don\u2019t seem to make much progress.A hiring manager at an American company who interviewed me recently for a permanent position asked me how much vacation I wanted. When I said four weeks, which is the legal Swiss minimum, she paused and said O.K., but then informed me that I would need to check my phone and email during this time.I responded that checking my email on vacation wasn\u2019t my definition of a vacation. She didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally, she grudgingly said they could write it into my contract that I wouldn\u2019t have to check my email during vacation. But the situation made me wonder, once again, if a country that bred this kind of culture was a place where I wanted to spend the rest of my working life.Later, when I asked a different American company about the possibility of working part time, four days a week, they said they didn\u2019t know how that would work. I tried to explain how I had successfully worked part time in several jobs overseas \u2014 even creating television commercials while doing so, but it was no use. I was fighting a culture that was not ready for my \u201cradical\u201d Swiss ideas. The fact that it was my own culture \u2014 supposedly so advanced and creative \u2014 only made things worse.My husband is back working full time at an American company. We both miss our yearly week spent in the Alps, which we used to take every summer, exploring nature in the truest sense \u2014 without a phone. And even though I still control my time as a freelancer, I become anxious when interacting with American clients who expect responses to emails at 10 p.m. and want me to be available every weekend. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can work like this knowing I could have it another way \u2014 if I\u2019m willing to move 5,000 miles away.Culture is hard to change \u2014 careers, slightly easier. So while many American professionals move to different companies or change career paths to find work-life balance, I\u2019ve found that despite some of the bureaucracy involved, another solution is to change countries.The United States is the only advanced economy in the world that does not guarantee paid vacation. It is also the only high-income country that does not require paid family and medical leave. And it\u2019s one of the only developed countries that still tie health care to employment, despite creating a national system. Whether all of these things reflect our culture or vice versa, I\u2019m not sure if I can handle one more heated discussion of whether Americans deserve paid leave, a \u201cperk\u201d the rest of the Western world views not only as standard policy but also as compassionate treatment of human beings.Recently, I applied for a copywriting job in Copenhagen, with the knowledge that it would come with a six-week vacation minimum, a culture that expects everyone to leave the office before 5 p.m., and a country where men and women are the most equal in the world (with leave policies that reflect this). Alas, I was turned down since I don\u2019t have the permit required to work in Denmark, but that\u2019s O.K. because luckily I still have the one that\u2019s required to work in Switzerland.My Swiss residence and work permit is on hold right now, waiting for me until October 2016 in a small state office in the center of a spa town 15 miles west of Zurich. And I\u2019m about one more 3 a.m. email or \u201cCan you work the weekend again?\u201d request away from flying across the ocean to pick it up.Chantal Panozzo is the author of \u201cSwiss Life: 30 Things I Wish I\u2019d Known.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Administration Draws Up Plan to Help Puerto Rico With Debt", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking for a way to help debt-ridden Puerto Rico, administration officials on Wednesday proposed an ambitious \u2014 if politically perilous \u2014 plan that stops short of a direct federal bailout but that its backers hope is sweeping enough to keep the island from becoming America\u2019s Greece.The plan would create a new territorial bankruptcy regime and impose new fiscal oversight on Puerto Rico, which is mired in the depths of a decade-long recession, running out of cash and struggling to make payments on $72 billion of debt. It represents an urgent bid by President Obama to offer a way forward. But it requires cooperation from a Republican-led Congress bent on imposing spending restraint.In describing the package on Wednesday, administration officials emphasized that they had exhausted the limits of their own authority to help Puerto Rico, and needed quick action by Congress to avoid a catastrophe.\u201cAdministrative actions cannot solve the crisis,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a joint statement with Jeffrey D. Zients, the National Economic Council director, and Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the health and human services secretary.\u201cOnly Congress has the authority to provide Puerto Rico with the necessary tools to address its near-term challenges and promote long-term growth,\u201d the statement said.The situation in Puerto Rico \u201crisks turning into a humanitarian crisis as early as this winter,\u201d one senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. Antonio Weiss, Mr. Lew\u2019s counselor, will explain the administration\u2019s plan in Capitol Hill testimony on Thursday.The Puerto Rican government has already \u201cdone a lot\u201d to restore fiscal order, the official added, but \u201cPuerto Rico cannot do it on its own, and the United States government has a responsibility to 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico\u201d to step in with additional help.The plan was shared late Wednesday with The New York Times and Agencia EFE, a news organization in Puerto Rico. On the same day, the island\u2019s Government Development Bank said it had ended weeks of fruitless negotiations with certain creditors, aimed at persuading them to voluntarily accept lower bond payments. The bank has a bond payment of about $300 million coming due on Dec. 1.Virtually all of the administration\u2019s proposed plan would have to be refined and approved by Congress. It would create a special territorial bankruptcy regime \u2014 something that does not now exist \u2014 to give Puerto Rico a place to restructure all of its $72 billion in debt, which it says it cannot hope to repay.The new regime could ultimately be a new chapter of the bankruptcy code, available only to Puerto Rico and other American territories. A senior administration official said the specifics would be left up to Congress.In a nod to Republicans in Congress, who have resisted even limited bankruptcy access for Puerto Rico, the administration also proposes to establish an independent body to monitor the island\u2019s fiscal affairs. Its role would be to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s credibility by policing the imposition of structural economic reforms; it would also demand better financial disclosures.Officials said the oversight body might resemble one that Congress established for the District of Columbia in the 1990s.At the same time, the package would seek to bring Puerto Rico, where unemployment tops 12 percent and 46 percent of citizens qualify for Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, into parity with the federal health programs and tax credits available in the states.The proposal calls for a Medicaid overhaul in Puerto Rico that would expand coverage and access to important services in the short term, and eventually remove a cap that currently applies to the island\u2019s Medicaid program. The effect would be more federal dollars for the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico. Administration officials also said they believed Puerto Rico\u2019s health care facilities needed to be brought up to standards on the mainland.The administration is also proposing to extend the earned-income tax credit, a refundable credit for the working poor that is payable even to people who earn too little to owe income tax. It is not currently available in Puerto Rico.Officials said that extending that type of tax credit would help increase the labor participation rate on the island, now a paltry 40 percent, the lowest in the United States and its territories. A fact sheet compiled by the administration said it would provide an \u201cadded incentive for formal participation in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy.\u201dThe tax credit, invented by conservative economists, already enjoys some degree of bipartisan backing. Administration officials who detailed the proposal offered no estimate of the cost of extending it to Puerto Rico, nor did they have a cost projection for the Medicaid expansion.The legislative proposal will be presented on Thursday to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction over all of America\u2019s territories. It is led by Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, which was itself a territory until 1959, when it became the 49th state.Puerto Rico is now barred from seeking any form of relief under Chapter 9, the type of bankruptcy that municipal governments use. The administration\u2019s proposal for a territorial bankruptcy regime represents a bolder approach than the bankruptcy bills that Congress has considered since the island\u2019s debt crisis began.Federal law allows for cities, counties, special districts and the like to seek bankruptcy protection if their states agree, but the states themselves are excluded. There are concerns that if Puerto Rico gains access to bankruptcy, fiscally troubled states like Illinois might try to follow suit.Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors have been arguing that the island\u2019s government has been portraying its financial situation as beyond repair, hoping to force the administration and Congress to give it access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The recent bankruptcies of distressed cities like Detroit showed them that bondholders can emerge with just pennies on the dollar, and they believe the same thing will happen if Puerto Rico is allowed to declare bankruptcy.The legislation introduced so far would make bankruptcy relief available only to Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities and its government enterprises, not to the government itself. Even those limited bills have failed to gain support from Republican lawmakers.There is some willingness, particularly among top Senate Republicans, to work out a compromise on the bankruptcy issue, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. But the Republican leadership appears willing only to grant Puerto Rico limited access to the bankruptcy courts and only with strings attached, like a federal \u201ccontrol board\u201d to oversee the island\u2019s finances.Control boards have been used in cases of severe municipal distress to take the power to spend public money out of the hands of elected officials. They do not generally have the powers that bankruptcy judges do to abrogate contracts, such as labor contracts and promises to repay debt.Both Democrats and Republicans are under pressure to respond to the Puerto Rico crisis. Largely because of the island\u2019s economic problems, Puerto Ricans are flooding the mainland United States, particularly central Florida, and are becoming an increasingly important voting bloc in the 2016 presidential race.In the hearing, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, will offer his first congressional testimony since his announcement in June that Puerto Rico\u2019s debt had become \u201cunpayable\u201d and he would seek a \u201cnegotiated moratorium\u201d with its creditors. His most recent appearance was in 2013, when he accused advocates of statehood of skewing a 2011 plebiscite to make it appear that a majority wanted Puerto Rico to become a state.\u201cThat is a great example of how you can lie with numbers,\u201d he told the same Senate panel at the time.Another scheduled witness is Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress and the statehood advocate who designed the 2011 voting process that the governor disputed. Mr. Pierluisi introduced the House bill to to give very limited bankruptcy access to Puerto Rico. In September, he testified before the Senate Finance Committee, challenging the governor\u2019s handling of the debt crisis and saying that general-obligation bonds \u201cmust be paid \u2014 period.\u201d The third witness is to be Mr. Weiss, the special adviser to the Treasury Secretary.Mr. Weiss was initially President Obama\u2019s nominee to be the under secretary for domestic finance \u2014 a hot-seat job as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates and Republicans fight to enforce the current debt ceiling.An earlier version of this article misidentified a news organization with which the administration shared the plan.

{"Headline": "New Labour Party Leadership Widens Rift Between Left and Center", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Less than six weeks into Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour Party, even his critics acknowledge that he has honored one central promise on which he was elected: to practice politics differently.At times, Mr. Corbyn, who spent three decades as an often-lonely standard-bearer of the party\u2019s left, seems to act as if his job has not really changed.The morning after his election, he declined an interview with a prestigious Sunday-morning television program, instead attending a local \u201cfun day\u201d organized by a mental health provider in London. Then, at a World War II commemoration service, he did not sing the national anthem, \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201dAnd there has been an acutely personal controversy over the whereabouts of Mr. Corbyn \u2014 a lifelong republican \u2014 on the day he could have attended his first meeting of the Privy Council, a largely ceremonial body, induction into which normally requires making an oath to the queen. Photos finally surfaced of Mr. Corbyn outside a restaurant in Scotland, where he had gone on a hiking vacation.Once renowned for their steely discipline and ability to stay on message, Labour lawmakers on Tuesday publicly \u2014 and angrily \u2014 denounced an unexpected policy shift within the party on deficit reduction that came after heated discussions late Monday.Feuding has broken out within the party over whether Britain should consider military intervention in Syria, which Mr. Corbyn opposes, and over his pledge never to use the country\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\u201cThe right-wing press is doing its best to distort what Corbyn does, but really they don\u2019t need to distort it very much,\u201d said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. \u201cLabour is now a split party that has done a massive U-turn on a key policy.\u201d\u201cAnd if you are going to snub the queen,\u201d Mr. Fielding added, \u201cyou had better make sure that you are really popular, because people are not going to take your side.\u201dMild-mannered and bearded, the 66-year-old Mr. Corbyn won a big majority from Labour members and supporters, many young, when the leadership job opened up after the Conservatives of Prime Minister David Cameron won the general election in May.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s lack of polish is part of his appeal in a Labour Party where political spin is associated with the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose support for war in Iraq and economic liberalism left many traditional supporters feeling betrayed.Supporters point to the enthusiasm Mr. Corbyn has generated among young people, and to the fact that he has reopened debate on important issues like economic policy, welfare and the renewal of the costly Trident nuclear weapons system.But he may soon have to attend to more practical issues of governing his newly fractious party. Tension recently burst into the open when one of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s biggest supporters, Diane Abbott, who speaks for the party on international development, criticized an article whose writers included another Labour lawmaker, Jo Cox, and which contemplated the creation of safe areas in Syria, possibly by using force.Ms. Abbott said on Twitter that it was sad that Labour lawmakers \u201cwant to support Cameron in his long-held desire to bomb Syria.\u201dAnother Labour deputy, John Woodcock, responded by reminding Ms. Abbott that she was spokeswoman on international development, \u201cnot an Internet troll.\u201dOn Monday, Labour lawmakers clashed in a private meeting over a government plan to eliminate the budget deficit. Having accepted a proposal on balancing the government\u2019s books several weeks ago, Labour\u2019s economy spokesman, John McDonnell, then instructed the party\u2019s deputies to oppose it, creating confusion in a crucial policy area. It was unclear how much Mr. Corbyn himself had to do with the decision.Some centrist Labour lawmakers fret that Labour could return to the poisonous atmosphere of the 1980s, when left-wing activists sought to depose legislators deemed to be too far to the right.That worry was compounded by the start of Momentum, a group sympathetic to the new leadership, which aims to organize in the party\u2019s grass roots.One Labour lawmaker, Mary Creagh, said she was confused about the motives behind Momentum, adding that it was \u201cnot impossible\u201d that a purge of some deputies on the right of the party could ensue.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s internal opponents hope that pressure will mount on him to step aside if the party performs poorly next year in local and regional elections in Wales, Scotland and parts of England, including London.But Mr. Fielding, of the University of Nottingham, said that it was hard to dislodge a Labour leader. He also said that, for the left, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s victory presented a historic opportunity to change the party\u2019s structures and hand power to activists, who tend to be more left-wing, at the expense of lawmakers.\u201cI don\u2019t think his priority is to win the next election,\u201d Mr. Fielding said. \u201cIt is to change the nature of the Labour Party.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Disadvantaged Start Hurts Boys More Than Girls", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGender GapNew research from social scientists offers one explanation: Boys are more sensitive than girls to disadvantage. Any disadvantage, like growing up in poverty, in a bad neighborhood or without a father, takes more of a toll on boys than on their sisters. That realization could be a starting point for educators, parents and policy makers who are trying to figure out how to help boys \u2014 particularly those from black, Latino and immigrant families.By the time boys from poor neighborhoods start kindergarten, they are already less prepared than their sisters. The gap keeps widening: They are more likely to be suspended, skip school, perform poorly on standardized tests, drop out of high school, commit crimes as juveniles and have behavioral or learning disabilities.Boys tend to have more discipline problems than girls over all. But the difference is much bigger for black and Latino children \u2014 and more than half of the difference is because of poverty and related problems, the researchers found. For instance, while boys in well-off families have almost the same test scores as their sisters, the gap is more than three times as large in the most disadvantaged families, the study found. While well-off boys are 3.1 percentage points less likely than their sisters to be ready for kindergarten, the most disadvantaged boys are 8.5 percentage points less likely.The pattern is clear at Astor School, a kindergarten through eighth grade public school in a low-income part of Portland, Ore. More than half the students are economically disadvantaged, and nearly half are minorities.Girls generally enter kindergarten with skills suited to doing well in school, like sitting still and using a pencil, while many boys act younger, having trouble listening to adults and controlling their impulses, said Jeff Knoblich, the school counselor.\u201cBoys get a message from a very young age to be a man, and to be a man means you\u2019re strong and you don\u2019t cry and you don\u2019t show your emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cI see boys suffering because of that, and a lot of that comes out in aggressive behaviors.\u201dThe researchers \u2014 who also included David Autor and Melanie Wasserman of M.I.T., Krzysztof Karbownik of Northwestern and Jeffrey Roth of the University of Florida \u2014 examined various reasons boys could be falling behind. By analyzing brothers and sisters in about 150,000 households using databases from the health and education departments in Florida, they could control for differences in families.They concluded that boys aren\u2019t born this way. Babies of low-income mothers are less healthy, but the boys are not worse off than the girls.Though disadvantaged children are more likely to be in underperforming schools or neighborhoods with drugs and violence, this alone does not explain the gender gap, the researchers said. Even in the same neighborhood and schools and for children of the same race, the gender gap is wider in less-advantaged families.\u201cBoys particularly seem to benefit more from being in a married household or committed household \u2014 with the time, attention and income that brings,\u201d Mr. Autor said.The researchers compared families based on whether the parents were single or coupled, and also looked at the education level of the mother, the income of the neighborhood and the quality of the school. They said they could not isolate which variable mattered most, probably because they are all intertwined.\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that daughters are drawing the lesson that I\u2019m going be the sole provider and the head of the family and take care of everything,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cSons could be drawing the lesson that the men I see around me are not working or committed fathers. They\u2019re doing other stuff.\u201dMothers, especially single mothers, tend to spend more time with daughters than sons. Boys, meanwhile, might need more oversight and discipline than girls to learn things like controlling their emotions and focusing on school.\u201cThe model in my mind, even though it\u2019s not proven, is maybe boys are more likely to be subject to behavioral problems, maybe they\u2019re born like that, and you can with parental investment and more resources fight those problems,\u201d Ms. Bertrand said.Lucy Armendariz, a single mother of four whose children attend Astor School, said her sons have deeply felt the lack of a male role model.Her oldest son, Kenny, 14, has received poor grades and skipped school often, though she said he is improving. Her two daughters, 12-year-old JoAnna and 8-year-old Selena, have each been on the honor roll and enjoy school.\u201cFor him, he wasn\u2019t able to have a positive male role model for years,\u201d she said. \u201cMy girls, they\u2019ve had me.\u201dHer younger son, Tiger, 4, can read a few words and will enter kindergarten next fall, but she said she can tell he is not as prepared as her daughters were at the same age. He seems to be doing better now that his father is more involved, she said.For policy makers, Mr. Figlio said, the study\u2019s results show disadvantage should be taken into account when devising ways to help boys, and gender should be considered when helping poor children, since boys and girls seem to respond differently.For parents, the data show the payoffs of spending more time with children, especially boys, Ms. Bertrand said. For single parents, supporting their families on one income, that might be easier said than done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Rich Tapestry", "Date": "2015-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Art of CollectingLONDON \u2014 Textiles played a critical role in the birth and development of Indian civilization. It was almost certainly in that subcontinent that cotton was first spun into thread and woven into cloth, some 8,000 years ago, and it was the textile industry that formed the basis of the expansion of India\u2019s economy and population. Even today, two centuries after the Industrial Revolution, more than 10 percent of the cloth produced in India is woven on hand looms, employing over 4 million people.The Victoria and Albert Museum has the largest collection of Indian textiles in the world \u2014 more than 10,000 pieces, from the simplest weaves that dressed poor farmers to lavish embroidered silks worn by Mughal emperors and maharajas. Yet the museum has never before staged an exhibition devoted to this rich subject \u2014 until now.\u201cThe Fabric of India,\u201d which will be on until Jan. 10, forms part of the V&A India Festival of events marking the 25th anniversary of the opening of the museum\u2019s Nehru Gallery of South Asian art. The exhibition, curated by Rosemary Crill and Divia Patel, spans nearly 2,000 years, from the earliest known example of an Indian weave, dating back to between the 1st and 3rd centuries, to the latest productions of the country\u2019s leading designers. Many of the pieces on display have never been shown since they were acquired in the 19th and 20th centuries.The exhibition opens with a huge 17th-century floor-spread from the Coromandel Coast, highlighting from the outset the role and ubiquity of textiles in the subcontinent.\u201cIn the absence of furniture, textiles are used in interiors in a very different way,\u201d Ms. Crill said. \u201cThey can be on the floor, on the walls, suspended from the ceiling; you sit on them, you lean against them, and the body is draped with them.\u201dIn fact, in traditional Hindu and Buddhist dress, textiles are draped rather than cut and stitched. \u201cYou still find this today with the sari, the lungi, the dhoti, the shawl, the turban,\u201d Ms. Crill said. \u201cAll these consist just of a big rectangle, which you can do whatever you like with, as it comes off the loom.\u201dThe first section of the exhibition, \u201cNature and Making,\u201d explores the origins of the materials cultivated to make cloths; the processes used to transform them (spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing and embroidering), and the kaleidoscope of regional styles.A peculiarity of hand-spun Indian cotton yarns is that they were almost invariably spun counterclockwise, useful for identifying the origin of pieces exported to faraway places.Other fibers are also explored, such as silk, flax, hemp and jute. The last two were resistant to moisture and rot, making them excellent for maritime purposes. Silk products, for the upper end of the market, and jute gunny sacks and floor matting, for everyday use, were mainstays of Bengal\u2019s economy. Pashmina shawls became a virtual monopoly of Kashmir. Embroidery is a speciality of the western part of the country, from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Baluchistan and the North West Frontier.\u201cSacred & Splendid,\u201d the next section, investigates textiles made for religious purposes and for imperial and princely courts. On display in the first part are a series of sacred textiles created for Hindu and Buddhist temples and for Christian churches. Among these are a shawl depicting the avatars of Vishnu, a talismanic shirt inscribed with the text of the Quran, and a huge figurative shrine flag from Uttar Pradesh. The centerpiece of the second part, \u201cSplendid,\u201d is Tipu\u2019s Tent, with its magnificent floral printed chintz walls and canopy. The tent was captured as war booty at the Battle of Seringapatam in 1799. This is the first time this textile pavilion has been fully displayed for more than 30 years.Also on display is a stunning silk Mughal hunting jacket from around 1620-25, with decorations of animals and plants revealing a sophisticated mixture of Chinese and European influences.Inexplicably, the opportunity to acquire this piece, now regarded as one of the most important Mughal garments to survive anywhere in the world, was twice turned down by the V&A, before the jacket was bought by the museum in 1947.There is evidence that Indian textiles were being exported as early as the 5th to 4th centuries B.C. But with the maritime expansion of Europe, this outflow turned into a flood, reaching a peak between 1795 and 1799 when the East India Company was exporting around 1.5 million pieces of cloth per year. As the stunning array in the section entitled \u201cDesigned to Appeal\u201d demonstrates, the subcontinent produced a huge range of products for markets that stretched from Africa and the Americas to Thailand, Indonesia and Japan.Bengal silk handkerchiefs with checks, spots and other patterns became known as \u201cbandanas,\u201d from the Hindi \u201cbandhana\u201d meaning to tie \u2014 a reference to the tie-dyeing process used to pattern them. Increasingly high tariffs were imposed on all Indian cloths coming to Britain in the 18th century to protect the domestic textile industry. As these printed handkerchiefs became a must-have accessory at all levels of society, from aristocratic ladies and gentlemen to farm laborers and sailors, their sale was banned between 1701 and 1826 \u2014 although tens of thousands of them were smuggled into the country.Checked cotton cloths from Madras were also exported by the East India Company in huge numbers and found particular fortune when they were re-exported to West Africa and the Caribbean, where they became essential fashion accessories as headties for women and now form part of traditional dress in some Caribbean islands. These fabrics are a rare example of a classic Indian fabric that remains popular both at home and overseas.By the 1820s industrially made English cottons were arriving in the subcontinent, eventually giving rise to hybrid products designed to appeal to the Indian market \u2014 a phenomenon explored in a section called \u201cTextiles in a Changing World.\u201d The cheap price of these products was to have a disastrous effect on the local hand-loom industry, putting millions of workers out of business.Mohandas K. Gandhi put the revival of his country\u2019s hand-loom industry at the center of the fight for independence, encouraging the mass spinning, weaving and wearing of traditional khadi cottons. One of the products of this was the simple, modestly embroidered sari worn by Indira Gandhi at her wedding in 1942, on loan from her Memorial Museum in New Delhi.The exhibition ends with India\u2019s contemporary fashion scene, and a display on that most elegant and emblematic of Indian women\u2019s attire, the sari. Although facing challenges from the influx of western dress styles, it is not being abandoned by today\u2019s designers, as some beautiful and innovative examples here show. \u201cFabrics continue to be a symbol of the Indian identity,\u201d said Ms. Patel, who curated the section. \u201cSome of the new designers are making the sari more fashionable and fun for young women \u2014 and something to get genuinely excited about wearing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Tribes Look Beyond Casinos for Income", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS, Mich. \u2014 For now, the field isn\u2019t much. All that stands along a quiet country road is a small storage building, beyond which rolls 28 acres of prairie a mile south of this blink-and-miss-it hamlet. To Mon-ee Zapata, though, this land is both the past and the future.As denoted on a historical marker across the street, this is the vicinity where, 175 years ago, the United States government rounded up her ancestors, the Potawatomi Indians, and forced them on a deadly walk to inhospitable Kansas. But it is also a place where her tribal elders plan to build a manufacturing operation of some sort as a way to ensure their long-term economic stability beyond the revenue from the six-year-old FireKeepers Casino.\u201cWe\u2019re buying the land that was originally our people\u2019s and using it for our future,\u201d said Ms. Zapata, a specialist in the Culture and Historic Preservation Office of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence here that our people existed. You can sense it.\u201d\u201cThere are places that are feeling saturation and competition more acutely than others, but all tribes are paying attention to diversification,\u201d said Kathryn R.L. Rand, co-director of the Institute for the Study of Tribal Gaming Law and Policy at the University of North Dakota. \u201cIt\u2019s happening sooner rather than later in some parts of the country where the industry is no longer experiencing the kind of growth it used to.\u201dWhile gambling revenue remains substantial \u2014 and indispensable for groups like the Nottawaseppi Band, which relied primarily on grants and federal payments before opening FireKeepers in 2009 \u2014 it also isn\u2019t experiencing the double-digit percentage growth typical throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.Last year, the nation\u2019s 459 tribal casinos in 28 states saw a meager 1.5 percent uptick despite the opening of 10 additional tribal casinos, according to data reported to the federal government by the National Indian Gaming Commission. That followed an anemic 0.5 percent increase in gambling revenue in 2013, a year that 24 new tribal casinos opened.The jitters are even more acute in places like Michigan. From 2012 to 2014, a nine-state cluster in the Upper Midwest experienced a 2.5 percent drop in gambling revenue despite the addition of 10 more casinos. The Nottawaseppi Band does not disclose revenue for FireKeepers, but its leaders have long known theirs was a highly competitive and mature market that featured three existing commercial casinos in Detroit, tribal casinos within a half-hour drive of every significant population center and a new commercial casino in Toledo, Ohio, that opened in 2012.In 2014, the Nottawaseppi Band formed Waseyabek Development Company, which will be the parent company for the band\u2019s future endeavors, and this year it hired Jennifer Turner, a consultant who helped tribes in northwest Arizona and Saginaw diversify, as temporary chief executive on a one-year contract. Along the way, the band has also snapped up parcels of land available in bankruptcy auctions around the south-central Michigan region, including the site south of Athens across the street from the historical marker, about five miles southeast of the reservation.\u201cIf we were to put all our eggs in one sector like Detroit and the car industry, when the economy caches a cold, Michigan catches pneumonia,\u201d said the Nottawaseppi tribal chairman, Homer A. Mandoka. \u201cYou can\u2019t diversify your economy if you don\u2019t have funds or don\u2019t have access to funds. And really, we weren\u2019t in a place to do any of that, and most tribes aren\u2019t, until the day it is granted to you that you can actually open a casino.\u201dTherein lies the paradox. A decade ago, the 120-acre Nottawaseppi reservation was dusty and unpaved, with a half-dozen ramshackle homes \u2014 \u201cthree weren\u2019t even livable but they were being lived in,\u201d Mr. Mandoka said \u2014 and no indoor plumbing. Now, because of casino payouts, it is a village of about two dozen new homes on cul-de-sacs and it has fresh, smooth streets, a group of government buildings that includes a Head Start center and a vast new powwow atrium. (Most of the members live outside the reservation.)Yet as grateful as tribes like the Potawatomi are for casinos, they know it\u2019s a fickle business, subject to the health of the broader economy, declining interest among younger Americans and the inclinations of federal and state policy makers. Owing to the historic distrust between Native Americans and the peoples who displaced them, there\u2019s a sense they must be alert to the prospect that their \u201crights\u201d to open casinos could be snatched back or curtailed.\u201cI think they\u2019re less worried about a downturn in profits and more in changes in the law, politics or in policy that might impact Indian gaming,\u201d Ms. Rand said. \u201cTribes have known all along that this is something that could change overnight.\u201dWhile some tribes have been diversifying since the advent of Indian-operated gambling in the late 1980s, much of that involved adding nongambling amenities like outlet malls, water parks, golf courses, bowling alleys and concert venues to the casino to compete better with destinations like Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.In recent years, though, there has been a proliferation of development and holding companies aimed at helping tribes go outside the casino and hospitality business altogether. In 2007, the Rincon Band of the Luiseno Indians of the San Diego area and the Colusa Indian Tribe near Sacramento formed First National Capital Partners, a private equity company that has bought four companies, including a netting manufacturer and a firm that builds shipping cases for bombs.\u201cOur goal is to have economic diversification to the point that it would pay 100 percent of tribal government operations and our health plan if the casino went away,\u201d said Steven Stallings, a Rincon council member and vice chairman of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association. \u201cThe tribes that aren\u2019t thinking about this really need to be.\u201dWhile some diversification efforts can seem random, many tribes aim to tie their activities back to their histories. The Yocha Dehe Wintun tribe near Sacramento has made a big push into olive oil, wine and honey production. \u201cThis carries on our tribe\u2019s historic connection with the land of the beautiful Capay Valley,\u201d said Leland Kinter, the tribal chairman, \u201cwhich is an important part of who we are as a people.\u201dMs. Rand pointed to the Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation, the largest Native American tribe with more than 300,000 members, as the pacesetter. Cherokee Nation Businesses, its holding company, reported $829 million in revenue in 2014 that included profits from manufacturing and service contracts with such varied entities as Cisco, the Department of Homeland Security and Lucent.The trick, Ms. Rand said, is to use the casinos not just as a tangible asset but also a training ground for entrepreneurial expertise.\u201cThe casinos give tribes collateral for loans from banks and institutional legitimacy that make them safe bets for other kinds of businesses, for contracts with the government, for partnerships with local governments,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they have a track record of good business relationships with vendors and people in their tribes with knowledge of growing businesses. It allows tribes to do even more in terms of economic diversification than they could be before tribal gaming.\u201dStill, Mr. Mandoka isn\u2019t under the illusion that the Potawatomi can diversify through green energy or manufacturing to the point that the casino ceases to be the Nottawaseppi Band\u2019s bedrock. Revenue from FireKeepers provides more than 75 percent of his group\u2019s annual budget of $30 million, according to the band\u2019s 2014 annual report.\u201cYou need to use your distributions and reserves to go out and get yourselves into a good position,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most models still have a very important slice of the pie that is from the casino.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Egypt Floods Gaza Tunnels, Smugglers Fear an End to Their Trade", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRafah JournalNow, the smugglers fear that Egypt has settled on a strategy that could spell doom for their trade: flooding the tunnels so they collapse. Within the past month, Egypt has flooded part of the nine-mile border area twice, causing two tunnels to cave in completely and damaging 10 or so more.Only about 20 of 250 tunnels are still operating \u2014 the worst situation smugglers can remember. They find themselves waiting nervously for the flooding to begin again.\u201cThis is the end for us,\u201d said Abu Jazar, a 42-year-old smuggler, who, like others interviewed for this article, declined to give his full name out of fear that the Egyptian authorities might identify him. \u201cIf they were bombing us, we could fix it.\u201dAfter Mr. Sisi became president, he saw the tunnels not only as a boon for Hamas \u2014 which he despised as an arm of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 but also as a direct threat to Egypt\u2019s security, asserting that arms and militants were flowing through them.\u201cFrom the beginning with Sisi, it was 50 percent hard,\u201d Abu Jazar lamented. \u201cNow it is 90 percent hard. It will be 100 percent hard when they turn on the pumps.\u201dThe tunnels once played a central role in the economy of this coastal enclave of 1.1 million people. Many of the goods that got into Gaza \u2014 livestock, cars, appliances, building materials \u2014 came through them.Mr. Sisi has put even more pressure on Gaza through prolonged closings of the Rafah border crossing. The 20 tunnels that remain in operation are able to move only small items like cellphones and cigarettes.During the summer, the Egyptians dug a trench on the Sinai side of the border and then laid pipes parallel to the dusty buffer-zone road, known as the Philadelphia route. Water from the nearby sea was pumped in, creating an overnight canal, said Abu Ibrahim, a Palestinian border guard. The water channel flooded two tunnels, causing them to collapse, smugglers said.In early October, it happened again, this time flooding 10 tunnels.Abu Khalil, 34, said he was working on repairs to his 2,000-foot tunnel when he heard the water rushing in.\u201cWe saw the water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have been washed away.\u201dHe returned with 15 workers and a pump. For two days, they pumped water out of the tunnel, trying to keep the walls from collapsing. Abu Khalil said that once all the water was pumped out he would shore up the walls with pieces of wood.\u201cGod willing, we\u2019ll take control,\u201d he said.If the recent episodes of flooding were a trial run, as many Palestinians here suspect, a more sustained flooding would be a disaster, because Gaza officials could not pump the water out fast enough into the sea.\u201cAll this area will be destroyed,\u201d said Wael Abu Omar, a Gaza Interior Ministry official, gesturing at the pools of muddy water drying in the sun.An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest measures to destroy the tunnels.If flooding recurs, it may have other consequences: harming nearby agricultural lands and exacerbating the salinity of Gaza\u2019s badly damaged aquifer. It has already terrified residents near the border, who fear their homes will buckle. \u201cThey say the water is coming from Egypt,\u201d Mansoura Abu Shaer, 73, said in the doorway of her small house. She and her 74-year-old husband had been forced to leave two other homes because of Israeli shelling. This time, she feared Egypt would prompt their displacement.Ms. Abu Shaer said she and her husband now sat outside at night, waiting for a flood \u201cto see if we should run away.\u201dOf the 20 tunnels still operating, about six were being lengthened to reach built-up areas again. One tunnel, smugglers said, was now two miles long.Some of the men were trying to reinforce and waterproof their passageways with cement and steel bars, hoping they would be saved from collapse if more flooding occurred.Two tunnel owners, they said, were now digging deeper into the ground, hoping to go down 160 feet, gambling that water pumped in by Egypt would not reach that far. \u201cTwo people are trying, but they have a lot of money,\u201d said Abu Rabah, 44, a former tunnel owner. \u201cThey are kings, first-class tunnel owners.\u201dAbu Ramzy, 33, who still had working tunnels, said they were waiting to see if that strategy had any impact. \u201cWe are watching and waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the tunnel guys are sleeping. All of us are thinking of what our next plan is going to be.\u201dAbu Rabah, whose tunnel had been idle for months, considered his options: \u201cMaybe we will go above the fence. Or maybe go by the sea. Or maybe we need planes.\u201d To that Abu Jazar responded, \u201cOr maybe we should just give up and go fishing.\u201dMajd Al Waheidi contributed reporting from Rafah, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Numerous States Prepare Lawsuits Against Obama\u2019s Climate Policy", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI predict there will be a very long line of people at the federal courthouse tomorrow morning, eagerly waiting to file their suits on this case,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, a lawyer for the firm Bracewell & Giuliani who represents several companies that are expected to file such suits.While the legal brawls could drag on for years, many states and companies, including those that are suing the administration, have also started drafting plans to comply with the rules. That strategy reflects the uncertainty of the ultimate legal outcome \u2014 and also means that many states could be well on the way to implementing Mr. Obama\u2019s climate plan by the time the case reaches the Supreme Court.The E.P.A.\u2019s climate change rules are at the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious agenda to counter global warming by cutting emissions of planet-warming carbon pollution. If they withstand the legal challenges, the rules could shutter hundreds of polluting, coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of such plants in the future, while leading to a transformation of the nation\u2019s power sector from reliance on fossil fuels to wind, solar and nuclear power.The official publication of the rules will also spur legislative pushback on Capitol Hill, where Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will introduce two resolutions to block them. The legislation will be introduced under the rarely used Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block an executive branch rule within 60 legislative days of its publication.While the resolutions are likely to pass the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama would be expected to veto them. But by introducing the resolutions, Mr. McConnell hopes to convey to the world that Congress does not support the Obama regulations \u2014 a message that could be amplified if the Senate votes on the resolutions before or during the Paris summit meeting.The Obama administration has sought to ensure that the rules will not come under question before that meeting. By delaying the official publication of the rules until nearly three months after they were announced, for example, the administration appeared to be trying to ensure that no major legal decisions to weaken them would be issued before the Paris meeting.\u201cThe president\u2019s illegal rule will have devastating impacts on West Virginia families, and families across the country,\u201d Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia said in a statement. Mr. Morrisey, whose home state\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on coal mining, is expected to play a lead role in the multistate lawsuit.States and companies may be hedging their bets.In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s administration plans to sue the E.P.A. At the same time, the governor, a Republican, has also instructed his director of environmental protection, Judson H. Turner, to begin crafting a plan to comply with the rules.\u201cThe governor of Georgia said to me, \u2018Whatever action may be taken on the legal front, we\u2019ll need to develop a plan that works for Georgia,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Turner said. If Mr. Obama\u2019s plan survives the legal challenge, Mr. Turner added, \u201cwe\u2019ll have the confidence that we\u2019ll put a plan for Georgia together that\u2019s better than a federal plan.\u201dSimilar dynamics are playing out in many other states that are suing over the rules, said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown University Climate Center, which focuses on state-level climate policies.\u201cIt\u2019s really rare to find a state that just says, \u2018Hell no,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.States have to submit an initial version of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018. States that refuse to submit a plan will be forced to comply with one developed by the federal government.Republican governors have denounced the rule, particularly its emphasis on pushing cap-and-trade systems; in his first term, Mr. Obama tried but failed to send a cap-and-trade bill through Congress. Since then, the term has become politically toxic: Republicans have attacked the idea as \u201ccap-and-tax.\u201d The governors of five states \u2014 Texas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Louisiana and Oklahoma \u2014 have threatened to refuse to submit a plan of any kind.But economists and many industry leaders have found that in many cases, the easiest and cheapest way for states to comply would be by adopting cap-and-trade systems.American Electric Power, an electric utility that operates in 11 states, is among the companies that intends to sue the administration over the rule. At the same time, the company\u2019s vice president, John McManus, said: \u201cWe think it makes sense for states to at least start developing a plan. The alternative of having a federal plan has risks.\u201d And he said that his company could support a cap-and-trade plan. \u201cThe initial read is that a market-based approach is more workable,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Foreign Graduates Get a Visa Edge?", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDecades ago there was a hit song in India, \u201cChitthi Aayi Hai,\u201d a tear-jerking anthem about mothers mourning the loss of sons who went to school abroad and never came back.The tune has changed. \u201cIt used to be by default students from India and China, in particular, bought one-way tickets over here,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, who has written extensively on international tech talent. \u201cNow it\u2019s a two-way street. They work for a few years and go home.\u201dIn what they believe will stimulate innovation and the economy, tech companies, lawmakers and universities have been urging the administration to make it easier for international students to stay in the United States. Thus, the fate of foreign graduates has become yet another spark in the contentious debate over immigration reform, prompting a variation on a familiar question: Do foreign graduates get jobs at the expense of American workers?The OPT extension, opponents argue, represents an end-around to the H-1B visa program that makes it easier for companies to hire low-cost foreign labor and for some unaccredited institutions to bring in students for short-term work instead of education. \u201cI would hope that D.H.S. would say this is a really bad idea and we should phase this out,\u201d said John Miano, the lawyer representing the union. \u201cWhen people are on student visas serving as guest workers, how absurd is that? They are supposed to be students.\u201dOstensibly, an OPT extension improves the long odds of being selected in the H-1B lottery, one of the paths to permanent residency. \u201cA longer OPT might mean they get two bites of that apple,\u201d said Ben A. Rissing, a professor at Cornell\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. But chances are still slim. Congress caps H-1B visas yearly at 65,000, with another 20,000 slots for graduates with advanced degrees. Consider the crush every April: Last spring, there were 233,000 petitions for H-1B visas within the first five days of their being offered.Amid pleas from Microsoft and other tech companies, two bills were introduced in Congress this year that would eliminate caps on employment-based visas and ease residency restrictions for those with graduate degrees \u2014 the \u201cgreen cards for grads\u201d solution. Both bills are stalled in committees.Or, as one prominent immigration lawyer, Stephen Yale-Loehr, put it: \u201cImagine if the next Google or Facebook were to be developed in India or China. All those jobs that could have been in the United States instead are being developed overseas and competing against our best companies.\u201dFor labor proponents, that is far too simplistic. \u201cBasing immigration policy on something as unpredictable as entrepreneurship is one of the things that sounds good,\u201d Mr. Miano said, \u201cbut it just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dFor graduates working under OPT, the uncertainty is frightening. \u201cYou\u2019re gambling your whole career based on some lottery,\u201d said Venkatesh, 27, who did not want his last name published for fear of its affecting job prospects. Having graduated from New York University in 2014 with a master\u2019s in computer science, he now works as a programmer for a large financial institution.Venkatesh, who is from Hyderabad, India, says that 12 months is not enough time to pay back university loans or to gain sufficient work experience.\u201cI would probably prefer to find a way to do something better in India,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t rely on a broken immigration system.\u201dLiz Robbins is a Metro reporter for The Times covering immigration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Tobacco\u2019s Staunch Friend in Washington: U.S. Chamber of Commerce", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Thomas J. Donohue, the chief executive of the chamber, had his own agenda. During the visit, he tried to persuade the prime minister to reject Irish antismoking legislation that would require tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in plain packages with images of diseased lungs or cancer patients.\u201cSuch a measure would undercut well-established protections for intellectual property,\u201d Mr. Donohue wrote to the prime minister, Enda Kenny, in a follow-up letter. The chamber head also sent a letter signed by several other business groups encouraging the same. Even the chamber\u2019s Polish affiliate weighed in.Since taking over in 1997, Mr. Donohue has transformed the chamber into a powerful lobbying force, an evolution most starkly epitomized by its aggressive advocacy for tobacco. While the organization represents a variety of industries, its strategy has been a boon for cigarette makers, which have relied heavily on the chamber to push their agenda at home and abroad.Few allies of Big Tobacco are as enduring as Mr. Donohue, who has personally lobbied the speaker of the House, the United States trade representative and the Irish prime minister on the industry\u2019s behalf. A review of industry records, which came to light during government litigation, highlights the longevity of his ties.In the 1980s, when he was a trucking lobbyist, he was bankrolled by cigarette makers as he led a campaign against excise tax increases, and was described in one corporate document as \u201ca good friend to the Tobacco Industry.\u201dIn the 1990s, after taking over the chamber, Mr. Donohue fought the Justice Department\u2019s tobacco litigation, personally lobbied against antismoking legislation in the Senate and promised \u201ca unique role in determining the future direction of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u201d to a big cigarette maker in a letter.In the early 2000s, Mr. Donohue publicly vowed to fight \u201coutrageous tobacco settlement fees in state after state.\u201d Chamber lawyers filed briefs on behalf of cigarette makers that challenged class-action suits, punitive damages awards and the validity of racketeering claims.His latest effort is the boldest. The chamber and its foreign affiliates are pressuring governments around the world to turn back antismoking legislation. That pits Mr. Donohue against groups like the World Health Organization, whose officials refer to the chamber as a tobacco industry front group.For tobacco companies doing business abroad, Mr. Donohue came to power at a pivotal moment.The W.H.O. and many foreign governments were starting to collaborate on efforts to curb smoking. New rules had also come into effect barring State Department officials from working against foreign antismoking laws.But the chamber has no such restrictions and has long-established connections to the American government. Diplomats at more than 40 American embassies serve as honorary board members or in other capacities at the chamber\u2019s foreign affiliates, blurring the lines between the organization\u2019s policy and American policy.This chamber\u2019s newly assertive style at times strays from the chamber\u2019s traditional role of promoting agendas that are broadly in the interest of corporate America. By its own bylaws, issues taken up by the chamber are supposed to reflect those of \u201cbroad significance to business and industry.\u201dMr. Donohue\u2019s tobacco advocacy reflects a chamber more willing to take on parochial interests. And members in other industries, some of whom have benefited from the chamber\u2019s strategy, have largely tolerated revelations about the chamber\u2019s tobacco lobbying.\u201cOur policy was that we didn\u2019t usually get into single-industry or single-company issues,\u201d said Richard L. Lesher, Mr. Donohue\u2019s predecessor atop the chamber. \u201cWe fought issues like tax and budget and certain regulations, but we didn\u2019t carry the water for single companies or single industries. In fact, we had policies prohibiting that.\u201dChamber officials adamantly deny they are lobbying on behalf of tobacco.\u201cThe chamber is not opposed to tobacco regulation. Declarative statement,\u201d Mr. Josten said. \u201cWe don\u2019t support smoking. Declarative statement.\u201dA Fresh StartA few weeks after he took over the organization in 1997, Mr. Donohue received a letter from Roy E. Marden, a Philip Morris executive.The advocacy for the industry by Thomas J. Donohue, the chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is part of a broader transformation of the chamber into the country\u2019s largest lobbying organization.Mr. Marden was blunt. Although he was encouraged by Mr. Donohue\u2019s hiring, he said the chamber \u201chad become a somewhat moribund organization.\u201d He admitted that dues payments from Philip Morris had diminished in recent years, adding that the company felt \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been much bang for the buck,\u201d according to documents made public as part of the tobacco litigation.His frustrations were common. The origins of the chamber date to 1912, when President William Howard Taft called for a \u201ccentral organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country.\u201d Gradually, it evolved into a far-flung bastion of American-style capitalism, welcoming multinational companies and foreign affiliates into the fold.But the chamber\u2019s scale slowed decision-making, and policies required the approval of the group\u2019s board. As Mr. Marden put it, mobilizing the chamber on a policy issue was like \u201cpulling teeth.\u201dAnd then there was what he called \u201cthe debacle over health care.\u201dCigarette companies were particularly incensed because a tobacco tax increase was part of President Clinton\u2019s plan. The chamber was \u201con the wrong side,\u201d a Philip Morris internal memo, another made public in tobacco litigation, opined at the time. \u201cWe have been intensely lobbying them behind the scenes.\u201dThree years later, Mr. Donohue promised a fresh start. Now 77, he is Brooklyn born, pugnacious and irrepressible, with a puff of white hair. When he took over the chamber, Joan Claybrook, the longtime consumer advocate, said it was \u201clike appointing Dennis Rodman chief of protocol,\u201d a line that Mr. Donohue called \u201ccute.\u201dMr. Donohue said of John Sweeney, then president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., \u201csomebody\u2019s got to go hit him in the mouth.\u201d Before making a point at a news conference last year, Mr. Donohue instructed reporters, \u201cIf you\u2019re resting a minute, wake up.\u201dMr. Donohue\u2019s ambition, he wrote in a reply to the Philip Morris executive, was \u201cto build the biggest gorilla in this town.\u201d He scrapped the chamber\u2019s in-house cable network and magazine, which were centerpieces of his predecessor.Instead, he focused on activism. Since he took over, the chamber has spent more than $1.1 billion on lobbying, and last year, it had 168 lobbyists working on its behalf, many on its own staff, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Donohue\u2019s chamber would lean more heavily on large corporations, promising in a letter that the chamber\u2019s small-business members \u201cprovide the foot soldiers, and often the political cover, for issues big companies want pursued.\u201d Splinter groups proliferated, like the Institute for Legal Reform, which took money from American automakers to attack tire safety regulations proposed after the Firestone scandal.\u201cDonohue was hired to revitalize and recapitalize the chamber, and refocus it on advocacy and representation for business in Washington,\u201d said Mr. Josten, the chamber official. \u201cOur revenue was in decline.\u201dFund-raising letters were sent to hundreds of companies. \u201cI bet he spent three and a half, four days a week calling C.E.O.s,\u201d Mr. Josten recalled. \u201cAt the time, Tom said, \u2018The hole\u2019s deeper and the ladder is shorter than I thought.\u2019 I was here; it was a true statement.\u201dTobacco companies were among Mr. Donohue\u2019s earliest supporters, in part because he was already well established as an ally.During his first stint with the chamber in the early 1980s, he was called on to calm restive cigarette makers, who were angered by a chamber health booklet that said smoking increases absenteeism. Mr. Donohue invited the tobacco industry to \u201csupply some additional data\u201d for a revised version, according to a letter later made public. Within a few years, the industry was citing chamber research that found \u201csmoking has no influence on an employee\u2019s likelihood of being absent.\u201dMr. Donohue left the chamber in 1984 to run the American Trucking Associations. Reflecting his ambition, he set up an offshoot called the Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, raising money from tobacco and winemakers to fight excise tax increases.He was tireless. He blanketed Congress with letters, hosted a breakfast with Dick Cheney, then a congressman, and organized a conference in Bal Harbour. He testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee in 1986, and again in 1987, when he told lawmakers that \u201cmom-and-pop stores\u201d were dependent \u201con sales of tobacco and alcohol.\u201d He decried the \u201cunfairness\u201d of \u201cproposals to nickel and dime buyers of cigarettes, wine and distilled spirits\u201d in a letter to newspaper editors.He brought the same zeal when he took over the chamber in 1997. The next year, the chamber assailed antismoking legislation proposed by Senator John McCain. Letters were sent to the Senate, news conferences were organized, and other industries were enlisted for public meetings, while Mr. Josten was dispatched to meet with House and Senate staff members.Mr. Donohue met privately with Newt Gingrich, then the House speaker, outlining the chamber\u2019s opposition to the legislation, and \u201cmet or spoke to\u201d five top senators, records show. The bill died in the Senate.The industry was pleased.\u201cThe chamber has become the antithesis of its former self,\u201d a Philip Morris memo reported in 1999, while an executive said in an internal email, the \u201cchamber is doing good work.\u201dDeep TiesA plaque on Mr. Donohue\u2019s desk, well known to visitors, says \u201cShow me the Money.\u201dThere are different ways to interpret this message. It could refer to his predilection for chauffeured Lincolns and chartered flights, or his $5.5 million paycheck in 2013, more than 10 times what his predecessor earned in his last full year, 1996.It is also a reminder that under his watch, the chamber has become a fund-raising juggernaut.The chamber is not required to disclose its donors, but from 2008 to 2012, the last two presidential election years, the number of donors who gave more than $1 million doubled, to 42, tax records show. Revenue at the chamber has grown to $164 million in 2013, from $76 million a decade earlier. Including its various affiliates, the total rises to $260 million.Philip Morris increased its contributions more than sevenfold to $180,000 in 1998, Mr. Donohue\u2019s first full year on the job, from $25,000 annually in the mid-1990s. A chamber official said that represented just 0.2 percent of the chamber\u2019s overall revenue at the time. Philip Morris Companies, known as Altria since 2003, does not disclose its current contributions, but it does have a seat on the chamber\u2019s board.There are other signs of deepened ties, including the revolving door between the chamber and the industry.Tom J. Collamore, a former Philip Morris executive, became a top lieutenant of Mr. Donohue\u2019s. And several employees have moved between the chamber and the industry, including Trinh Nguyen, a former chamber employee who is now a spokeswoman for Philip Morris International, which was spun off from Altria in 2008.A spokesman for Altria, David Sutton, said in an email that the company\u2019s work with the chamber \u201cfocuses on issues of general interest to the American business community,\u201d including corporate tax policy and tort reform. \u201cWe will continue to work with the U.S. Chamber on issues important to Altria,\u201d he added. Philip Morris International did not comment.For tobacco companies, Mr. Donohue\u2019s chamber has provided cover for those afraid of attracting headlines for fighting their own battles. Mr. Donohue once told Washington Monthly magazine that he wanted to give the chamber\u2019s members \u201call the deniability they need.\u201dThe year after the fight over the Senate bill, Philip Morris directed the chamber\u2019s work on a polling project surveying attitudes about government-funded litigation. The chamber took the lead in public, while \u201cPM stays in the background,\u201d a Philip Morris memo outlined. The cigarette maker selected the polling firm and reviewed the questions, according to documents released as part of the litigation and also detailed in a recently published book about the chamber called \u201cThe Influence Machine.\u201d\u201cNew Poll Finds Solid Public Opposition to Government Lawsuits\u201d the chamber\u2019s news release was headlined, while leaving out the tobacco industry\u2019s role.Cigarette makers have not been the only beneficiary of such tactics.Complications have arisen in the chamber\u2019s new approach.Its bylaws say the board \u201cshall determine the eligibility and appropriateness of all proposals to be considered and acted upon.\u201d But under Mr. Donohue, the chamber\u2019s board swelled to more than 100 seats, meaning, in practicality, many decisions are subordinated to committees or affiliated groups.Chamber officials said no board vote took place before the organization sought to discourage foreign governments from passing antismoking laws.\u201cWe were not aware of these lobbying efforts, and we oppose efforts to promote tobacco use,\u201d said Brooke Thurston, a spokeswoman for Steward Health Care of Boston, a hospital group on the chamber board.Two insurance giants on the chamber\u2019s board, Anthem and the Health Care Service Corporation, have said little about the chamber\u2019s tobacco industry ties.\u201cIn the long run, they may find it distasteful and against their quoted values for the chamber to be doing what it is doing abroad on tobacco, but they\u2019ll hold their nose,\u201d said Wendell Potter, an outspoken former communications executive for Cigna, another insurer. \u201cThey do it because they know the chamber can be very helpful to them at some point down the road.\u201dBlair Latoff Holmes, the chamber\u2019s spokeswoman, said in an email that \u201cthe premise that the chamber has mounted a \u2018campaign\u2019 to oppose efforts to discourage smoking simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not surprised to hear that board members haven\u2019t heard of this. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d she said.The chamber emphasized that it discouraged its own staff from smoking. \u201cTo my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Josten said of Mr. Donohue, \u201cTom has never taken a puff of a cigarette.\u201dDouglas Dalby contributed reporting from Dublin, and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Votes to Lift 40-Year Ban on Oil Exports", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe House of Representatives voted on Friday to reverse a 40-year-old ban on oil exports, giving major oil companies a political victory at a time when they are suffering from lower oil prices and falling profits.Still, the House vote makes it more likely that the export ban, which was enacted in the 1970s when the American economy was threatened by international oil embargoes and falling domestic production, will become an important issue in the presidential election campaign.Jack N. Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, praised the bill as a job creator. \u201cAmerican producers would be able to compete on a level playing field with countries like Iran and Russia, providing security to our allies and accelerating the energy revolution that has revitalized our economy,\u201d he said.The global price of a barrel of oil remains near its lowest point since the depths of the 2009 recession.\u201cEvery American household is saving $700 or more this year from lower fuel prices because refiners are passing on savings to U.S. consumers,\u201d said Jay Hauck, executive director the Crude Coalition, a lobbying group led by several refiners who profit from the low price of domestic oil, which is their principal raw material.The Obama administration has been tinkering with the ban, and it recently gave oil companies temporary permission to export a limited amount of oil to Mexico. The administration has also allowed the export of a limited amount of extra-light oil, which comes out of the shale fields of Texas and several other states.The Obama administration has been reluctant to lift the export ban entirely, in part because environmentalists say it would encourage more petroleum development and hydraulic fracturing at a time when the nation should be moving away from fossil fuels to curb climate change.The debate has been spurred by nearly a doubling of domestic oil production over the last five years, reducing imports and expanding inventory reserves across the country. But production is now suddenly dropping, and oil producers have been forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India Announces Plan to Lower Rate of Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Under growing pressure to join in an international accord to battle climate change, India on Thursday announced its long-term plan to reduce its rate of planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution and to aggressively ramp up its production of solar power, hydropower and wind energy.At the heart of the Paris deal will be the plans put forth by each government detailing how it will help its economy make a transition to low-carbon energy sources. For years, India has been viewed as an intransigent outlier in global climate-change talks. Indian leaders have long argued that their priority was lifting a vast population out of poverty, and that this could not be done swiftly without the rapid expansion of coal-fired power, the largest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution. They also maintain that rich countries like the United States bear moral responsibility for global warming and should not deny poor countries the chance to build their economies.Under the plan, India does not commit to an absolute reduction in carbon emissions levels, unlike other major polluting economies, including those of the United States, China, the European Union and Brazil. India\u2019s emissions would continue to rise, but at a slower pace than business as usual. Still, some environmental advocates praised the plan\u2019s commitment to renewable energy and said that, if enacted, it could put India on track to reduced carbon emissions in the long run.\u201cThis is a really significant step for India,\u201d said Anjali Jaiswal, director of the India program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group in New York. \u201cIt puts renewable energy at the center of the plan and positions India for further reductions in emissions going forward. It is a shift from what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d Other analysts were critical, saying that by resisting an absolute decrease in carbon emissions, policy makers in New Delhi were swimming against a global current.\u201cThis is a very conservative approach,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, a research center with offices in Washington and Geneva.At the core of India\u2019s proposal is a commitment to reduce the intensity of its fossil fuel emissions 33 percent to 35 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, while producing 40 percent of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources such as wind, solar power, hydropower and nuclear energy by the same year. Under the terms of the plan, India\u2019s economy would grow roughly sevenfold by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, while its carbon emissions would triple. Yet if India took no action, emissions would also grow sevenfold. Significantly, the pledge to reduce the pollution rate is not conditional on financial contributions from wealthier countries, a move that climate policy activists praised as a major step forward from India\u2019s earlier positions.Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Obama discussed their climate change plans at a bilateral meeting in New York. Behind the scenes, people familiar with their talks say, the two leaders may be moving toward making a joint announcement involving the exchange of United States-developed low-carbon technology. Before meeting with Mr. Obama, Mr. Modi toured companies in Silicon Valley. \u201cMuch before the climate change debate began, Mahatma Gandhi, regarded as the father of our nation, had said that we should act as \u2018trustees\u2019 and use natural resources wisely as it is our moral responsibility to ensure that we bequeath to the future generations a healthy planet,\u201d it reads. In 2011, before he took office, Mr. Modi published a book that presented the moral case for action on climate change. He has positioned himself as a progressive on the issue. Yet he has also made plain that his top priority for his nation is economic growth, leading millions of people out of poverty \u2014 even if that means increasing the use of cheap, coal-fired electricity. The pledges released on Thursday represent a sort of compromise: both strikingly ambitious on renewable energy and adamant in a refusal to actually diminish emissions. In an interview this week, India\u2019s environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, illustrated that tension. \u201cPoverty reduction is our top priority. Providing power in the next 2,000 days is our priority. We want faster development. My people have a right to grow,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cClimate change is also a priority. We have the world\u2019s largest renewable energy sector. We want to clean our air, our water, our energy, our environment. It\u2019s not because someone else is saying so. We want that.\u201d Even though all the major economies have submitted climate change plans, experts say the plans\u2019 collective impact will not be enough to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. An analysis released Monday by researchers at the group Climate Interactive shows that the collective pledges would reduce the warming of the planet at century\u2019s end to about 6.3 degrees, if the national commitments were fully honored, from an expected 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit, if emissions continued on their present course. That is a long way from meeting their own shared target, set in 2010, of limiting global warming to about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.That level of warming, while potentially producing dire effects on agriculture, sea level and the natural world, might at least be tolerable, some experts say.Ellen Barry reported from New Delhi, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Loan Servicers Faulted for Some Student Loan Problems", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees companies that service student loans, estimated in a report released on Tuesday that about a quarter of the current federal loan borrowers are delinquent or in default, despite the availability of programs that offer more affordable payments for the majority of borrowers. (Loans are generally considered in default if a borrower doesn\u2019t make payments for nine months.)More than 41 million borrowers owe a total of $1.2 trillion in student debt, making it the second-largest type of consumer debt, behind mortgages. The average debt is now nearly $30,000, and borrowers continue to struggle with loans despite the improvement in the overall economy, the report noted.Richard Cordray, the bureau\u2019s director, said in a prepared statement that the continued distress of student borrowers means that \u201ccleaning up the servicing market is critical.\u201dThe bureau said it was working with the Education Department and the Treasury Department to explore new, more consistent industrywide servicing rules to increase borrower protections.A servicer is a company that collects payments, issues monthly statements and generally serves as a point of contact for borrowers. (The report didn\u2019t refer to companies by name. But big servicers of federal student loans include FedLoan Servicing, Great Lakes Higher Education, Nelnet and Navient.)In their comments, the bureau said, borrowers told of problems like \u201csloppy, patchwork\u201d practices, including lost paperwork and misapplied payments. (The comments reflected borrower experiences with servicers of both federal and private student loans).The comments suggest, the bureau said, that servicers do not inform borrowers about applicable payment plans unless the borrowers specifically ask. But putting more borrowers in such plans could go a long way toward reducing delinquencies. According to research cited in the report, participants in the most generous repayment plans available for federal student loans \u2014 like the \u201cpay as you earn\u201d and income-based repayment programs \u2014 have much lower delinquency rates than borrowers in the standard, 10-year repayment plan.The report also cited research that found that 70 percent of federal direct loan borrowers in default met the income requirements for lower monthly payments, raising questions about whether servicers are informing borrowers about affordable repayment plans.Here are some questions and answers about student loan servicing:\u201cUnderstand that there are a range of options,\u201d whether you are current, delinquent or in default on your federal student loans, said Deanne Loonin, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. Rather than asking about specific repayment programs and using technical terms, she said, ask your servicer questions like, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a more affordable option for me?\u201dMaura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said borrowers should educate themselves about the various plans and press for information, even if their servicer isn\u2019t being especially helpful: \u201cThis is an area where the consumer has to be assertive and persistent.\u201d(Alternative payment plans for private student loans are more limited, and they vary by lender.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With VW No Longer an Option, Diesel Buyers Have Few Choices", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsNow, nearly 500,000 American owners sit in recall limbo over Volkswagen\u2019s admission that it equipped its TDI diesels with emissions-cheating software to evade detection of rampant diesel pollution. So put-upon VW owners are facing an ultimate test of their loyalty: Do they keep faith in Volkswagen to fix the cars that have served them well? Or do they look to other brands for high-mileage vehicles that are as clean as advertised?For now, VW diesel fans have few comparable options.Alexandra Llamas considered her 2009 VW Jetta TDI the perfect car for her. It was affordable and had great fuel economy for long commutes in Texas, where she lived before moving to California. It also had a seal of approval as the 2009 Green Car of the Year, rated by a panel of environmental and auto experts who included Jay Leno.\u201cIt was my first ever full, adult purchase,\u201d said Ms. Llamas, now the marketing director for the San Francisco Symphony. \u201cI loved it. It was good for the environment, and I filled it once a week versus two or three times for my Acura.\u201dNow, like many TDI owners, Ms. Llamas is feeling duped. She is waiting to see what steps Volkswagen will take to fix the problem, but after all that has happened, she says she would still buy another VW.\u201cDefinitely. Accountability is the key,\u201d Ms. Llamas said.Her steadfast support is common among VW owners. Since the beginning of 2015, Edmunds.com data shows that more than one in three VW TDI owners bought another VW diesel. And while 38 percent of VW owners remained with the brand, TDI drivers were even more loyal, with more than half trading for another VW.But now that VW has frozen the sales of new and used TDI models, car shoppers may struggle to identify comparable alternatives, she said.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a hole in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cOther vehicles certainly could be substituted, but there aren\u2019t a lot of affordable fun-to-drive diesels out there.\u201dOther fuel-efficient and earth-friendly options are also significantly more expensive. VW\u2019s diesel technology has been the market\u2019s most affordable, adding as little as $700 to the price of a conventional gasoline model. In hindsight, VW\u2019s decision to save money by forgoing a costly liquid urea treatment system \u2014 used by Mercedes and other makers to scrub diesel tailpipe pollution \u2014 may cost the company billions of dollars in fines, recall costs, legal damages or lost business.Linda Wheat bought a 2013 VW Jetta SportWagen after owning Peugeot diesels in the 1980s. The VW, with its modern turbocharged diesel, was different.\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Ms. Wheat said. \u201cNo smell, no sound, no stinky exhaust. I thought, \u2018They figured it out.\u2019 But they actually figured it out on the sly.\u201dMs. Wheat, a middle-school art teacher, lives in Tyler, Tex., where big oil companies dominate.\u201cBeing environmentally conscious is barely on the radar here, but within my limited means I was determined to do what I could,\u201d Ms. Wheat said. \u201cI was so pleased to find a green car with great mileage and terrific pep.\u201dDespite their professed love of fuel economy, only 2.8 percent of VW owners traded for a hybrid. Diesel drivers in general tend to scoff at hybrids for their often-dawdling performance or mushy-feeling regenerative brakes.It then switches to gas-electric hybrid power and returns an official 42 m.p.g., versus 36 m.p.g. for the Jetta TDI. And its price has fallen nearly $1,200, to $26,495, after owners take an available $7,500 federal tax credit.Tim Mahoney, Chevrolet\u2019s global chief marketing officer, is a defector himself, having previously served as the marketing chief for Volkswagen of America.Mr. Mahoney said it was too early to gauge if the VW scandal would translate to a sales increase for the Volt. \u201cThere has definitely been a mind-set of a division between hybrid and diesel fans,\u201d he said.Ms. Llamas said she was not taken by the original Volt\u2019s styling. But the new model is more attractive, though the issue of where to charge a plug-in can be tricky for city and apartment dwellers.\u201cI\u2019d consider another diesel, even from Audi or BMW, or a hybrid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Volt could be a great alternative, and the price point is good as well.\u201dFrustrated, Ms. Wheat said she might just leave her next choice in a car up to chance.\u201cI bought a lottery ticket,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I win, I\u2019m buying a Tesla.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Hillary Clinton Would Regulate Wall Street", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial ReformNothing exposes the chasm between the activist wing and the donor class of the Democratic Party like the regulation of Wall Street.The desire to assail too-big-to-fail-banks energizes the left and has propelled Senator Elizabeth Warren and the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. But some of the party\u2019s most prodigious donors come from the financial industry and don\u2019t much care for its vilification. And Bill Clinton\u2019s administration oversaw the deregulation on Wall Street.The short version: Directionally, Mrs. Clinton favors more intensive regulation of Wall Street than what is in place now. Bank executives and lobbyists will find little to like in her plan. But her approach stops short of the wholesale breakup of too-big-to-fail banks favored by Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Warren. She would prefer instead to take the philosophical approach embodied in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act a few steps further.Mrs. Clinton proposes changes that would put stiff new costs on the largest banks and give regulators greater power to break up an institution they view as too sprawling and risky. But her plan does not envision a return to the era of the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law requiring commercial banking and investment banking to remain separate. It was reversed by Congress during the Bill Clinton administration (an action that had less to do with the global financial crisis than many liberal activists would suggest).The Dodd-Frank law gave regulators a broad range of powers to oversee \u201csystemically important\u201d institutions. Combined with new international capital rules and more aggressive enforcement of corporate lawbreaking, it has made it more expensive than ever to be a sprawling global megabank. Giant banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were left to decide on their own whether to respond to those costs by slimming down, such as by selling or shutting down business units.If Mrs. Clinton is elected president and gets her way \u2014 some of her ideas could be executed through regulatory fiat, others would require legislation \u2014 the incentive to slim down would be that much greater.Here are the key elements of her plan.So, for example, Wells Fargo has about twice the assets of Goldman Sachs, but primarily funds itself with bank deposits and engages in relatively plain consumer and business lending. A more complex firm like Goldman, which relies more heavily on fast-moving capital markets for funding, would thus have more to fear from the risk fee.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal does not detail the exact scale or structure of the fee, which would require legislation. She envisions it as being substantial enough to have a meaningful impact on banks\u2019 decision making. In other words: billions, not millions, of dollars.Dodd-Frank requires that major banks prepare \u201cliving wills\u201d that describe the legal details of how they would be unwound in the event of a failure. But this proposed legislation would instead grant regulators more power to determine that, for example, a bank that had repeated major ethics scandals might just be too sprawling and complex to manage and therefore could endanger financial stability.Her plans for addressing risks in those segments of the shadow banking system are still relatively vague, but she has more specifics on the securities lending and repurchase system, which was a key channel through which the failure of Lehman Brothers and near-failure of the insurer A.I.G. endangered the global financial system in 2008.Mrs. Clinton calls for new international rules governing disclosure, margin and collateral requirements to try to make a failure of one global bank or insurer less likely to endanger the entire world economy. These are changes that are likely to take place through regulatory action rather than legislation.With the first Democratic debate taking place next week, the stage is set for financial reform to be a major area where Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders can clash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Gathers Experts to Evaluate Global Preparedness for Fiscal Crisis", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 As financial leaders gather here this week to assess the health of the world economy, one of the central topics for discussion will be how ready markets are for a crisis in a large developing economy such as China, Turkey or Brazil.For the better part of five years, the I.M.F., which is sponsoring the weeklong meetings of financiers, government officials and central bankers from around the world, has been bogged down where it does not usually engage in rescue work \u2014 developed Europe, in particular Greece.Now, with concerns mounting that the currency devaluation in China will create a sustained flow of money out of emerging markets, the fund must make sure that it is still in a position to fulfill its core function: identifying risks in emerging economies and bailing them out when they run short of cash.Driving these global concerns is the fear that the dollar-based debt in large emerging market economies has risen to unsustainable levels.Last week, the fund became the latest global watchdog to warn of the dangers of an emerging market debt bubble, highlighting in a report published in advance of this week\u2019s meetings that corporate debt levels had soared to $18 trillion from $4 trillion 10 years ago. Citing this debt overhang, the fund has again lowered its outlook for emerging market growth in 2015 to 4 percent \u2014 about half the rate at which developing countries were growing earlier this decade.Construction companies in Turkey, real estate developers in China, retail chains in Brazil and steel companies in Malaysia \u2014 along with many other fast-growing emerging market companies \u2014 have gorged on cheap dollar-based debt in recent years.Analysts say the fund has the resources to rescue a few countries if the need arises. But if the flow out of emerging markets is so extreme that more than just a handful of countries fail, the fund will be hard-pressed to rescue them all.This is not a central forecast, of course. And the likelihood that the Federal Reserve may hold off on raising interest rates should take some of the pressure off emerging markets. But with Congress continuing to refuse plans to increase the I.M.F.\u2019s resources, the feeling among many experts is that the fund is overstretched.\u201cAll the I.M.F. can do now is to highlight the risks and warn of an upcoming hurricane,\u201d said Stephen Jen, a former I.M.F. economist who manages a hedge fund based in London. \u201cThere is not much they can do at this point because we are talking about a change in the tide of capital flows.\u201dThe Institute for International Finance, a trade group for global banks, said in a report this week that emerging markets would this year experience their first net outward flow of funds \u2014 about $548 billion \u2014 since 1988.And in each case, he points out, it was global investors unloading their risky assets \u2014 be it mortgage-backed securities in the United States, Greek government bonds or the debt paper of the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras \u2014 that set off the rout.The I.M.F. has been highlighting these risks in recent months. Over the summer, for example, it published a wide-ranging study that assessed the ability of large economies to handle a situation in which anxious foreign investors headed for the exits by selling their bonds or not renewing credit lines.Malaysia, South Africa and Turkey were singled out as countries that, because of their reliance on short-term capital flows, should take steps to increase the cash in their foreign currency reserves to prepare for a crisis if and when it came.And in the I.M.F.\u2019s report on corporate debt in emerging markets, Turkey and China were singled out as having experienced the largest increases in debt in recent years.But some worry that the fund\u2019s five-year effort in the eurozone, where in 2013 it had allocated $64 billion of its $90 billion loan book, may have hampered its ability to warn publicly about problems in emerging markets.\u201cThe focus has been on Europe,\u201d said Gary N. Kleiman, an independent emerging market analyst based in Washington. \u201cThe fund has been complacent in looking at the structural weaknesses in emerging markets.\u201dBut other analysts \u2014 like Mr. Jen, the hedge fund manager \u2014 say that to blame the fund for missing the China slowdown or the rout in emerging market currencies is a bit unfair.The emerging market debt buildup has been more than a decade in the making \u2014 the consequence of many years of extra-loose monetary policies by global central banks that resulted in a worldwide glut of dollars.As the dollar has begun to strengthen over the last year, signaling a halt to the easy money flows into emerging markets, the fund and other economists have \u2014 with varying degrees of bluntness \u2014 warned of the consequences for the global economy.\u201cThe dollar is rallying against everything,\u201d said Raman Srivastava, a senior bond investor at Standish Mellon Asset Management in New York. \u201cAnd that is very deflationary.\u201dIn many emerging markets, the dollar\u2019s strength relative to local currencies is being felt in many ways.Large exporters in Malaysia, bankers there say, are hoarding their dollars as opposed to converting them into wobbly ringgits, the Malaysian currency.And in Turkey, local savers have been switching their deposits to dollars from liras as their currency keeps losing value. The ratio of dollar-to-lira deposits \u2014 a telling gauge of the confidence Turks have in their local currency \u2014 is approaching 50 percent.This dollar squeeze, some experts believe, is more structural than cyclical, and as companies in emerging markets go bankrupt and their economies stagnate, the United States cannot help but be affected.\u201cWe are not growing at 4 percent anymore \u2014 we are barely at 2 percent,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo. \u201cThe U.S. economy really is dependent on the rest of the world for growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spying Case Against U.S. Envoy Is Falling Apart, and Following a Pattern", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Last fall, federal agents raided the home and office of Robin L. Raphel in search of proof that she, a seasoned member of America\u2019s diplomatic corps, was spying for Pakistan. But officials now say the spying investigation has all but fizzled, leaving the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute Ms. Raphel for the far less serious charge of keeping classified information in her home.Both the Justice Department and a lawyer for Ms. Raphel, Amy Jeffress, declined to comment.The Raphel case has also been caught in the crosswinds of America\u2019s tempestuous relationship with Pakistan, a strong Cold War alliance that has frayed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks amid recriminations between Washington and Islamabad. Ms. Raphel has for decades been at the center of shaping American policy toward Pakistan, and she has maintained close ties to Pakistani officials even as many of her colleagues became disenchanted with what they saw as Islamabad\u2019s duplicity in the fight against terrorism.Against that backdrop, the federal investigation has delved into the murky world of international statecraft, where diplomats exert influence through a careful dance of trading, sharing and eliciting information. Some American investigators viewed Ms. Raphel\u2019s relationships with deep suspicion.After months of secret surveillance, the investigation into Ms. Raphel spilled into the public when agents searched her home and her State Department office last October. She was quickly stripped of her security clearances and left in the dark about the precise origins of the federal investigation. Her friends said that the investigation had taken a deep emotional toll.\u201cSometimes the whiff of scandal can be worse than any actual scandal,\u201d said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to Washington who has known Ms. Raphel for years. \u201cMore people hear that you were investigated than care to know you were cleared or never actually charged.\u201dAmerican officials will not discuss what classified information the investigators found in Ms. Raphel\u2019s home. The current and former American officials who discussed the case did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about it publicly.In discussions with prosecutors, according to several government officials, Ms. Raphel and her lawyer have cited the Petraeus case as the vital precedent. If passing secrets \u2014 including notes on war strategy and the names of covert officers, which Mr. Petraeus shared \u2014 and lying about it amount to a misdemeanor, then, Ms. Raphel says, she should not face any charges.Some American investigators remain suspicious of Ms. Raphel and are loath to abandon the case entirely. Even if the government cannot mount a case for outright spying, they are pushing for a felony charge related to the classified information in her home. Several officials acknowledged, however, that the case would be difficult to prosecute because it would require intelligence agencies to declassify information and would probably reveal secrets about American surveillance of foreign officials.Felony charges for improperly taking and storing classified information, while not espionage in the common sense of the word, would be filed under the Espionage Act and could expose Ms. Raphel to years in prison \u2014 a far stiffer penalty than Mr. Petraeus and others received.During the Clinton administration, Ms. Raphel served as the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, and then ambassador to Tunisia. In the George W. Bush administration, she was the State Department\u2019s coordinator for reconstruction in Iraq, where she tried to guide the war-torn country toward a stable government and economy. After retiring from the government in 2005, she joined Cassidy & Associates, a Washington lobbying firm that represented the Pakistani government, among other clients.At the start of the Obama administration, Richard C. Holbrooke, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, reached out to Ms. Raphel to work with him. She quit her lobbying job and was sent as a State Department contractor to the American Embassy in Islamabad, where she helped disburse American aid to Pakistan. Until the F.B.I. investigation, she continued to work on contract as an adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan.During her long career working on Pakistan issues, Ms. Raphel has seen the country go from being one of America\u2019s most steadfast Cold War allies \u2014 and a partner in the 1980s effort to train Afghan fighters to expel Soviet troops from Afghanistan \u2014 to being something of a pariah to Washington. Although Pakistan pledged support for the campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks, senior members of both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations became convinced that Pakistani soldiers and spies were aiding the Taliban and other militant groups by attacking American troops in Afghanistan.For their part, Pakistani officials stoked fury in the country about the C.I.A.\u2019s campaign of drone strikes and what they came to see as the agency\u2019s expansion operations in Pakistan.As relations between the two countries deteriorated, Ms. Raphel was considered one of Pakistan\u2019s few remaining supporters in the top echelon of American government. This earned her enemies among government officials in India, Pakistan\u2019s archrival, but also among colleagues who considered her too sympathetic toward an unreliable ally.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was very fashionable to say, \u2018I think the Pakistanis have a point,\u2019 but Robin did that,\u201d said Cameron Munter, the former American ambassador to Pakistan who oversaw Ms. Raphel\u2019s work in Islamabad.An article last Sunday about Robin L. Raphel, a member of America\u2019s diplomatic corps who has been a suspect in an espionage investigation by the Justice Department, gave outdated information about Cassidy & Associates, a Washington lobbying firm. While the company once represented the Pakistani government, it no longer does. The article also misstated the time and location of Ms. Raphel\u2019s marriage to Arnold L. Raphel, another foreign service officer. They were married in 1971 in Tehran, Iran \u2014 not in the mid-1970s in Islamabad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Credit Suisse to Raise $6.3 Billion in New Capital and Cut Costs", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bank, which is based in Zurich and has large operations in New York and London, is betting on growth in Asia and other emerging markets, where it will build up its private banking and wealth management businesses. It also said that it would seek to publicly list part of its Swiss banking operations but that it would retain control of the business.The new chief, Tidjane Thiam, has inherited a bank that is facing steeper capital requirements by regulators and that has been criticized for not reducing the size of its investment bank operations as aggressively as some of its rivals, like UBS.Yet the change of course was not greeted with enthusiasm by investors on Wednesday. Shares of Credit Suisse slumped 3.6 percent in trading in Zurich.Credit Suisse reported a weaker-than-expected profit in the third quarter as uncertain market conditions weighed on its fixed-income and trading operations. The bank said third-quarter profit declined 24 percent, to 779 million Swiss francs, or about $816 million, from the quarter a year ago. Revenue fell 9 percent, to 5.99 billion francs.\u201cOur third-quarter results reinforce the need for a restructuring of the bank aimed at reducing the volatility of our earnings and better aligning the activities of our investment bank behind the needs of the clients of our private banking and wealth management division,\u201d Mr. Thiam said in a statement.He said that Credit Suisse was in the process of \u201cright-sizing\u201d its investment bank as it looks to reduce capital used by that business.As part of its overhaul, Mr. Thiam said the bank planned to cut jobs in Britain, Switzerland and the United States, mostly through attrition. He said the bank also expected to make new hires as it expanded other operations.Mr. Thiam noted that Credit Suisse had more than 4,000 back-office positions in London, a high-cost location, and said as many as half of those jobs could be relocated to less costly offshore locations.Still, streamlining is not the sole focus.Kian Abouhossein, a banking analyst with JPMorgan Chase, said in a note that the objectives of Credit Suisse\u2019s strategy shift were \u201cvery revenue-driven rather than cost-based (with some divisions to double revenues over three years).\u201dAs part of the changes, Credit Suisse said it planned to expand its universal bank in Switzerland and its private banking and wealth management arm in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.\u201cEmerging markets, particularly in Asia, present us with great opportunities, and we will work hard to capture the wealth management opportunity in these economies that we are confident will become the largest proportion of the world economy over time,\u201d Mr. Thiam said.In hopes of unlocking value in its Swiss banking unit, Credit Suisse plans a partial initial public offering of 20 to 30 percent of the business by the end of 2017.Mr. Thiam called the unit undervalued and said that a public stock offering would clarify pricing of the business. It would also make it possible to acquire assets from smaller private banks in Switzerland, which are facing much higher compliance costs.The lender also said it would streamline and reorganize its structure, with three geographic divisions focused on its Swiss banking, Asia-Pacific and international wealth management operations. The investment bank is to be split into two divisions: global markets in one, and investment banking and capital markets in the other.\u201cWe want to be a leading private bank and wealth manager, with strong investment banking capabilities,\u201d Mr. Thiam said in a briefing with journalists. \u201cWe need to stay good at investment banking to succeed with private banking.\u201dMr. Thiam, the former chief executive of the British insurer Prudential, took the top job at Credit Suisse on July 1, succeeding Brady W. Dougan, an American who had led the Swiss bank since before the financial crisis.The bank also announced management changes. Iqbal Khan will head the international wealth management business. Timothy P. O\u2019Hara will run the new global markets division within the investment bank business, while James L. Amine will head the new investment banking and capital markets division.Mr. Khan will join the bank\u2019s executive board as part of a shake-up that will include the appointment of six new members.Credit Suisse also expects to sell or close less profitable businesses.It announced on Tuesday that it would shift advisers and clients in its domestic private banking business in the United States to Wells Fargo early next year.On Wednesday, Credit Suisse said that business, as currently structured, was not positioned to be competitive \u201cwithout significant investment or acquisition\u201d and did not meet the bank\u2019s \u201cprofitability criteria.\u201dAfter the revamping, Credit Suisse expects to more than double its pretax income in the Asia-Pacific region by 2018 and to post pretax income gains in its international wealth management and Swiss bank divisions.Credit Suisse said it planned to raise up to 6.05 billion francs through two share offerings. The bank also said it planned to further reduce its costs by 3.5 billion francs by the end of 2018 and would invest about 1.5 billion francs from those savings to support growth in other parts of the bank.Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, placed Credit Suisse\u2019s long-term debt ratings under review for a possible downgrade after the announcement.\u201cMoody\u2019s believes that if the bank achieves the targets set out in the plan on a sustainable basis, the improved profitability and capital position would be positive for creditors,\u201d the ratings agency said.\u201cHowever, the likely drag on profitability the plan will cause over at least the next two years is a primary credit concern in the near term, and will be a focus of Moody\u2019s review.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The shop burned, and rebels occupied his home in Aleppo. Sheltering with relatives, Mr. Alabi rarely went outside, fearing the army would draft him and send him to the front line.Then, like many before him, Mr. Alabi fled to Europe, where he landed last month: 22 years old, with a backpack, a ninth-grade education and little idea what to do next.\u201cI have no specific hopes,\u201d he said hesitantly, after struggling to buy bread here because he speaks only Arabic. \u201cBut God willing, after I register, if there is a way to play soccer. ...\u201d He added, \u201cMaybe I can sew?\u201dThe mass displacement of so many young men poses great challenges to countries like Syria, homeland to more than half of those fleeing: The exodus deprives them of a demographic vital to reconstruction and economic growth.There are also great risks for Europe, which has long struggled to assimilate immigrants and could face the creation of a new underclass that taxes the public purse. Many also worry that pockets of radicalization could grow if the aspirations of the new arrivals end in isolation and poverty.\u201cWe know on the positive side that migration can boost economies and trade and lead to cultural exchange,\u201d said Lado Gvilava, the head of the International Organization for Migration in Turkey, the departure point for most migrants. \u201cBut if it is mismanaged, it becomes a problem for both the receiving states and the countries left behind.\u201dThe largest single group appears to be young men, open to adventure but woefully ill informed about what they are getting into. Among the dozens of them interviewed recently in Turkey and Greece, only a few spoke any languages other than their native tongue, and most knew little about the countries they hoped to make their new homes. Some were surprised to learn that beer and pork are prominent in German cuisine.\u201cOur only hope is in Europe,\u201d said Mohammed Atiyya, 21, a Palestinian from Damascus who had been training as a metal worker when he was drafted into the Syrian Army.After nearing the end of what was supposed to be a two-year stint, he realized he was more likely to end up dead than decommissioned, so he deserted, later fleeing to Europe by raft.He is now in Hamburg, Germany.United Nations officials report meeting with many educated Syrians, including engineers, civil servants and small-business owners, who were solidly middle class before the war, but have since lost their homes and businesses.A minority arrive with clear plans.\u201cMy destination is France because I speak French,\u201d said Fayez, 27, a Syrian dentist who said he had fled Aleppo because he risked his life going to work every day.After he was detained by rebels, he submitted an asylum application to France, but it was rejected, he said, so he now planned to sneak in, register as a refugee and continue his career.\u201cWe didn\u2019t flee because we didn\u2019t have the money, but because of insecurity,\u201d he said in Greece, giving only his first name to protect relatives in Syria.The countries of Europe face a difficult task in integrating the migrants into their work force so they can contribute economically instead of adding to the social burden.Many of the new arrivals lack transferable skills and speak no European languages. Even professionals like doctors and engineers are unlikely to have their foreign credentials immediately recognized.To succeed, Europe must invest heavily in programs to teach migrants languages, pair skilled workers with jobs and help everyone else find training and work, said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, the president of the Migration Policy Institute Europe.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.Countries like Germany and Sweden have organized economies and labor needs that could facilitate this, he said. But Austria has a small work force, and Spain, Italy and Greece have economic problems and high unemployment, leaving little room for migrants.\u201cThis could lead to a serious set of troubles for Europe, politically and economically, in the next few years,\u201d Mr. Papademetriou said.Many worry that migrant populations that fail to integrate could become fertile ground for unrest or radicalization, especially if they find themselves under attack by right-wing elements.And a terrorist attack linked to even a tiny group of migrants could change the situation for all. At present, there is little to stop jihadists from the Islamic State or other radical groups from covertly slipping in with other migrants.Others arrive with no documents or lie about their origins, making them hard to identify, he said. And fleeing war traumatizes many migrants, further complicating their assimilation.Mohammed Abdul-Haq, a Palestinian from Damascus, was working in a sweet shop when the Syrian government arrested him in a sweep aimed at dissidents, he said. During three and a half years in prison, he was hung by his wrists and beaten during interrogation.Released in August, he rushed to Turkey to head for Europe with his wife and their 10-year-old daughter, but he had thought little about what he would do once he got there.\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Mr. Abdul-Haq, 38. \u201cI just want to get there and be safe.\u201dHow the outflow affects Syria will probably depend on how and when the civil war ends.Many of those fleeing to Europe have recently left areas controlled by President Bashar al-Assad, saying that basic infrastructure was failing and that life had become dangerous. Some have deserted the army or are dodging service, deepening the personnel shortage of his army.Scholars of human migration say that the longer conflicts last and the farther away refugees settle, the less likely they are to go home.After the conflict in Bosnia, many refugees returned, if not necessarily to their home communities, which had been subjected to ethnic cleansing, said Laura Hammond, the head of the development studies department at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Many refugees returned to Chechnya after the conflict there because they had settled nearby in other parts of Russia, where they did not feel welcome.But even those who remain abroad often retain strong ties with their home countries, Ms. Hammond said, either by sending money to their relatives or by returning occasionally with capital and experience acquired abroad to invest and start businesses.\u201cWe should think of these men as part of the work force who will eventually help rebuild the country,\u201d she said of the men fleeing Syria. \u201cThey don\u2019t think of themselves as permanently gone.\u201dBut with the Syrian war in its fifth year and no end in sight, few of those heading for Europe plan to go back.Waiting in a park in Turkey before catching a raft to Greece, Mohammed, 41, said the battle for Aleppo had chased his family from their home and destroyed the body shop where he had worked.Now he was aiming to settle in Germany and bring his wife, their four children and his mother, he said, declining to give his last name because he feared for his family.He would work wherever he could, he said, and he was carrying a book to teach himself German.\u201cThe words are very heavy,\u201d he said, unable to produce a phrase. He knew little more about his destination.\u201cIt is a beautiful country, and the people are nice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I have heard.\u201dKaram Shoumali contributed reporting from Izmir, Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Ends One-Child Policy, Allowing Families Two Children", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision was a dramatic step away from a core Communist Party position that Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who imposed the policy in the late 1970s, once said was needed to ensure that \u201cthe fruits of economic growth are not devoured by population growth.\u201dFor China\u2019s leaders, the controls were a triumphant demonstration of the party\u2019s capacity to reshape even the most intimate dimensions of citizens\u2019 lives. But they bred intense resentment over the brutal intrusions involved, including forced abortions and crippling fines, especially in the countryside.The efforts to limit family size also led to a skewed sex ratio of males to females, because traditional rural families favor boys over girls, sometimes even resorting to infanticide to ensure they have a son.Thursday\u2019s announcement was the highlight of a party meeting at which President Xi Jinping sought to display his control over a flagging economy after a jittery summer of tepid indicators, deepening skepticism about official data and a tumultuous slide in the stock market.Yet while the decision surprised many experts and ordinary Chinese, some said it was unlikely to ignite either a baby boom or an economic one.A look at how China\u2019s restrictions on the size of families changed over the years.\u201cAnything demographic, we always have to think in terms of decades in terms of long-term impact,\u201d said Tao Wang, the chief China economist at UBS.\u201cIt\u2019s not about stimulating growth or consumption of baby powder next quarter or next year,\u201d she said. \u201cWill the birthrate go up? Yes. Will it somehow increase significantly? We don\u2019t know.\u201dThe initial public reaction to the party leaders\u2019 decision was restrained, and many citizens in Beijing who were asked whether they would grasp the chance to have two children expressed reluctance or outright indifference. Some, however, were pleased.\u201cReally? Can you show me the news on your phone?\u201d said Sun Bing, 34, the owner of a small technology store in Beijing, who had his 2-year-old son by his side.\u201cThis is a good thing, and I\u2019m very supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to have a second kid in two years. But, of course, it\u2019s not cheap to raise children.\u201dYang Qing, a clothing designer in Hangzhou, in eastern China, said that she wanted a second child, in addition to her 4-year-old son. \u201cI always heard that people got fined for having more than one child, and they had to hide out and they will get caught,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was scared.\u201dBut most people interviewed voiced misgivings. \u201cBefore I had my first child, I was hoping for the relaxation of the one-child policy,\u201d said Chen Feng, 36, who works at a medical equipment company. \u201cI changed my mind after I gave birth to my daughter.\u201d\u201cIt takes a lot of energy to take care of a child, and you want to make sure the child will have a good future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my husband and I have decided not to have a second child.\u201dThe party decision to relax the restriction on family size will not take effect immediately. Like the previous relaxation of policy in 2013, this policy change must first be endorsed and refined by the central government and then implemented by provincial-level governments, which can introduce their own variations on the general policy. That could take many months.Demographers and economists say the cost and difficulty of child-rearing are likely to deter many eligible couples from having two children despite the relaxed rules, Mu Guangzong, a professor of demography at Peking University, said in a telephone interview.\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of parents would act on it, because the economic pressure of raising children is very high in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe birthrate in China is low and its population is aging quickly, so from the policy point of view, it\u2019s a good thing, as it will help combat a shortage of labor force in the future. But many parents simply don\u2019t have the economic conditions to raise more children.\u201dNow, the party leadership has acted more forcefully, apparently in the hope that a burst of children will replenish the nation\u2019s work force and encourage more consumer spending.The decision to replace the one-child policy with a \u201ctwo child\u201d one was among the few big changes announced during the four-day Central Committee meeting in Beijing. A fuller summary of the five-year development plan is likely to be released in several days, and the full document will be issued next year.The one-child policy took shape in the late 1970s, when Mr. Deng and other leaders concluded that China\u2019s growing population threatened to stifle economic growth. The restrictions went into effect in cities, but in the countryside, many families continued to have two or more children. The government has also exempted ethnic minorities.As the years went on, harsh official campaigns to fine and punish couples who violated the rules, and sometimes to force abortions, became a source of public discontent.Liang Zhongtang, a retired demographer who has advised Chinese officials on population policy since the 1980s and has long argued that they should relax the one-child policy, said the change had come too late to make a big difference in the country\u2019s population trajectory. He said he had pushed for such a change since the 1980s.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a problem of whether you permit ordinary people to have one or two kids. It\u2019s about returning their reproductive rights to them,\u201d Mr. Liang said in a telephone interview from Shanghai. \u201cIn over 200 countries and regions around the world, which of them nowadays controls people\u2019s reproduction like this?\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Manhattan Apartment Prices Near Million-Dollar Mark, Reports Say", "Date": "2015-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA million dollars doesn\u2019t buy what it used to in Manhattan. A combination of high demand and too few listings pushed the median sales price for a Manhattan apartment to just shy of a million dollars in the third quarter of the year, setting a record high, according to several market reports to be released on Thursday by major real estate brokerage firms. The median sales price, which reflects the middle of the market and is less affected by high-end sales, was $999,000, according to a report by the Corcoran Group. Reports from other brokerage firms, using different figures and methodologies, put the median price at or just below the million-dollar mark, with most calling it a record. \u201cIt seems like a lot of money anyplace else,\u201d said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which calculated a median price of $998,000. In Manhattan, \u201cwhat you get for a million dollars is not a lot of space,\u201d she said, pointing out that buyers on a budget must turn to New York\u2019s other boroughs or to the suburbs to find better values. After rising incrementally over the course of last year, inventory has essentially been flat since January, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of the Douglas Elliman report. In the third quarter, Mr. Miller said, there were 5,654 available listings, approximately 20 percent below the 10-year average of 7,047 available listings. \u201cThat creates price pressure,\u201d he added. It also makes for rapid-fire sales. The amount of time that listings spent on the market fell 20 percent to a record low of 73 days in the third quarter, according to the Douglas Elliman report. \u201cYou have to be very competitive and you have to be quick,\u201d especially at the lower end of the market, Ms. Herman said. \u201cI tell people, \u2018You really have to have your ducks in order financially and know the market yourself.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOverall, the number of closed sales was up for the quarter, driven by robust closings in new development. While prices remained high across all market segments, the average sales price for the luxury market, defined as the top 10 percent of closed sales, dropped 12 percent in the third quarter, to $6.73 million, compared with $7.68 million during the same period last year, as fewer luxury properties closed, according to the Corcoran report. Buyers may be reaching a breaking point when it comes to outsize prices for luxury real estate. \u201cAt the upper end of the market, I believe there is a little bit of a pushback from the buyers,\u201d said Diane M.\u00a0Ramirez, chief executive of Halstead Property, which found that the average sales price of co-ops with at least three bedrooms declined 26 percent to approximately $3.1 million in the third quarter of the year, from $4.2 million during the same period last year. Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, said that though demand remained strong, \u201cmore sellers are asking prices that are just not justified.\u201d Especially at the high end, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a glut of inventory that\u2019s overpriced.\u201d Still, most brokerage firms expect that prices will continue to increase and inventory will remain in short supply as the end of the year approaches. Gregory\u00a0J.\u00a0Heym, chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, said that while concerns about potential stock market turmoil, a slowing Chinese economy and the possibility of rising interest rates \u201ccould have an impact in the fourth quarter, if you look at the fundamentals, we don\u2019t see supply and demand changing on a broad basis.\u201d Even with an anticipated rise in new development inventory in the next several months, Mr. Heym said, \u201csupply is still at a very low level, and the city\u2019s economy is humming along and rates are still low.\u201d \u201cEverything that\u2019s been driving the market over the last couple of years is still in place,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

She is certain to face questions about the emails during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate and later this month when she is set to appear before a House committee.In the interview, which was taped Tuesday and broadcast Sunday evening, Mr. Obama called those questions legitimate and said \u2014 without directing the comments specifically at Mrs. Clinton \u2014 that public officials in high office should know better.\u201cAs a general proposition, when we\u2019re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it.\u201dThe president said Mrs. Clinton \u201ccould have handled the original decision better\u201d and might have been quicker to disclose work-related emails that had been kept on a private server outside government control.Mr. Obama said her possession of the email server \u201cis not a situation in which America\u2019s national security was endangered.\u201d He declined to say whether the email controversy was \u201cnot that big a deal,\u201d but he chided Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics for their single-minded focus on the issue.\u201cThe fact that for the last three months this is all that\u2019s been spoken about is an indication that we\u2019re in presidential political season,\u201d he said.Mr. Kroft repeatedly challenged the president on his policy in Syria and at one point complained that Mr. Obama was \u201cfilibustering\u201d with long answers. Mr. Obama at times appeared exasperated by Mr. Kroft\u2019s questions, once responding: \u201cIf you ask me big, open-ended questions, expect big, open-ended answers.\u201dThe president accused critics of expecting better results in Syria after just a year of American intervention, noting that Afghanistan still needs attention over 13 years after the United States sent its military there. He said the situation in Syria would not be resolved by American troops.\u201cResolving the underlying crisis is going to be something that requires ultimately the key players there to recognize that there has to be a transition to new government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the absence of that, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\u201cIf you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in, in order to prop up your only ally, is leadership, then we\u2019ve got a different definition of leadership,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He added later: \u201cThe fact that they had to do this is not an indication of strength.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s aggressive moves into Syria, in particular strikes by warplanes and missiles, in the last several weeks appeared to take the United States government by surprise.

{"Headline": "A Rapist\u2019s Nightmare", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUCKNOW, India \u2014 FOR as long as anyone can remember, upper-caste men in a village here in northern India preyed on young girls. The rapes continued because there was no risk: The girls were destroyed, but the men faced no repercussions.Now that may be changing in the area, partly because of the courage of one teenage girl who is fighting back. Indian law doesn\u2019t permit naming rape victims, so she said to call her Bitiya \u2014 and she is a rapist\u2019s nightmare. This isn\u2019t one more tragedy of sexual victimization but rather a portrait of an indomitable teenager whose willingness to take on the system inspires us and helps protect other local girls.Bitiya, who is from the bottom of the caste system, is fuzzy about her age but thinks she was 13 in 2012 when four upper-caste village men grabbed her as she worked in a field, stripped her and raped her. They filmed the assault and warned her that if she told anyone they would release the video and also kill her brother.So Bitiya initially kept quiet.Six weeks later Bitiya\u2019s father saw a 15-year-old boy watching a pornographic video \u2014 and was aghast to see his daughter in it. The men were selling the video in a local store for a dollar a copy.Bitiya is crying in the video and is held down by the men, so her family accepted that she was blameless. Her father went to the police to file a report.The police weren\u2019t interested in following up, but the village elders were. They decided that Bitiya, an excellent student, should be barred from the local public school.\u201cThey said I was the wrong kind of girl, and it would affect other girls,\u201d Bitiya said. \u201cI felt very bad about that.\u201dEventually, public pressure forced the school to take her back, but the village elders continue to block the family from receiving government food rations, apparently as punishment for speaking out.Civil society scrutiny belatedly led to the arrest of four men, who were then released on bail. The case has been dragging on since, and Bitiya\u2019s father died of a heart attack after one particularly brutal court hearing. The family also fears that members of upper castes will kill Bitiya\u2019s 16-year-old brother, so he mostly stays home \u2014 which means he can\u2019t take jobs, leaving the family struggling to afford food.The rape suspects offered a $15,000 settlement if Bitiya\u2019s family would drop the case, bringing the money in cash to her home with its dirt floor. Bitiya had never seen so much cash \u2014 but scoffs that she wouldn\u2019t accept twice as much.\u201cI want them in jail,\u201d Bitiya says. \u201cThen everyone watching will know that people can get punished for this.\u201d\u201cI never felt tempted,\u201d adds her grandfather.Bitiya says she does not feel disgraced, because the dishonor lies in raping rather than in being raped. And the resolve that she and her family display is having an impact. The rape suspects had to sell land to pay bail, and everybody in the area now understands that raping girls may actually carry consequences. So while there were many rapes in the village before Bitiya\u2019s, none are believed to have occurred since.\u201cThere has been a breaking of the silence,\u201d Kuckreja said. \u201cPeople are speaking up and filing cases.\u201dKuckreja notes that the cost of sexual violence is a paralyzing fear that affects all women and girls. Fearful parents \u201cprotect\u201d daughters from sexual violence and boys in ways that impede the girls\u2019 ability to get an education, use the Internet or cellphones, or get a good job. For every girl who is raped, Kuckreja says, many thousands lose opportunities and mobility because of fear of such violence.In one village, I asked a large group of men about rape. They insisted that they honor women and deplore rape \u2014 and then added that the best solution after a rape is for the girl to be married to the rapist, to smooth over upset feelings.\u201cIf he raped her, he probably likes her,\u201d explained Shiv Govind, an 18-year-old.I\u2019m rooting for Bitiya and strong girls like her to change those attitudes and end the impunity that oppresses women and impoverishes nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Push to Use Ride Sharing to Drive Economic Growth in Upstate New York", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJosh Mohrer, the general manager of Uber NY, said that his company projected it could bring some 13,000 freelance driving jobs to upstate New York, framing the ubiquitous Uber app as an economic engine.\u201cFor far too long, New Yorkers have seen jobs leave the state rather than be created right here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said as he stood on the ceremonial Million Dollar Staircase in the State Capitol. He thanked Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other politicians for helping \u201ccatalyze an amazing revitalization\u201d of the upstate economy.\u201cUber,\u201d he said, \u201cwants to build on this revitalization.\u201dWhile it is unclear whether the governor will champion the issue, he has expressed support for the company. On Tuesday, his office said that he was open to examining regulations for the industry in the next session.The debate over upstate expansion could potentially reignite another point of contention in the on-again, off-again political schism between Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who sought and failed \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to limit the number of Uber cars in New York City. In July, Mr. Cuomo offered high praise to ride-sharing apps even as Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, was being dealt a political defeat.At the time, Mr. Cuomo added, \u201cI don\u2019t think government should be in the business of trying to restrict job growth.\u201d\u201cThis is a company creating jobs,\u201d he said, adding that caps could cause Uber to \u201cgo next door and grow their jobs.\u201dUber\u2019s aggressive campaign against Mr. de Blasio included television ads and a special tab in its app showing projected wait times for cars if a cap was introduced. Last month, Uber \u2014 which said it does not make political contributions to candidates \u2014 added to its collection of politically connected employees by hiring Josh Gold, the former political director of the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council.At the same time, the company has increased its lobbying efforts in New York: It has spent more than $270,000 on lobbyists at the state and city level during the first half of this year, according to state records. In the last six months of 2014, Uber spent about $135,000 on lobbying at those levels.During the legislative session that ended in June, Lyft also engaged lobbyists to push for a state bill that would create new rules for so-called transportation network companies. It did not pass, but Lyft has promised to take it up again next year.David Mack, the director of public affairs at Lyft, said on Tuesday that Uber\u2019s campaign was \u201ca continuation of a conversation that has been going on for many months.\u201dAnd, Mr. Mack said, drivers in those two cities were \u201cvery anxious to have it come back.\u201dThe new jobs Uber has promised to create upstate would be \u201cinsecure, low-paying, part-time work at the expense of a full-time profession,\u201d Bhairavi Desai, the alliance\u2019s executive director, said.\u201cThis billion-dollar corporation just doesn\u2019t want to have to pay the expenses that everyone else does in the for-hire industry,\u201d Mr. Barwell said.An internal estimate the company issued on Tuesday suggested that in its first year Uber would provide freelance jobs upstate for 13,000 drivers, who would earn \u2014 after the company cut of about 25 percent \u2014 about $80 million in fares.On Tuesday, Uber had lined up several local legislators, some of whom testified to frustration at not being able to find a cab.Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Emma G.

{"Headline": "A Global Chill in Commodity Demand Hits America\u2019s Heartland", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "In China and other emerging markets, growth is waning and demand for the raw materials that drive the global economy has dried up.Supported byGRANITE CITY, Ill. \u2014 A thousand miles south of this gritty steel town on the Mississippi River, West Texas oil rigs have shuddered to a halt. Seven hundred miles north, mines in the Iron Range of Minnesota have been stilled.The drilling rigs, with their deep underground pipes, once consumed much of the steel that Granite City\u2019s blast furnaces could produce, while the mines supplied the raw material.So now, more than 2,000 workers at the mammoth United States Steel plant not far from St. Louis are waiting to see if they will be next. This month, the company warned them it might be forced to idle the plant. Layoffs could begin around Christmas.Granite City may be waiting, but a chill in economic activity is already evident across a broad swath of the nation\u2019s heartland stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, as prices of commodities sink.Whether it is roustabouts and other oil field workers in Texas and North Dakota, miners in Minnesota, farmers in Iowa, or heavy equipment makers and sellers in Illinois, the reason for the fear is the same: a sudden plunge in demand for commodities.\u201cEverybody is scared to death, and we\u2019re anticipating the worst,\u201d said Mike McCabe, 53, a second-generation steelworker who has spent nearly two decades working in the furnace where molten iron and scrap metal are transformed into steel. \u201cThey pay us to make pipe. That\u2019s what we do. But the rumor is that the order book is terrible.\u201dThe fall in prices for a variety of products, including crude oil, iron ore and agricultural crops like corn and soybeans is reminiscent of the collapse of the technology boom in 2000 or the bursting of the housing bubble nearly a decade ago. And behind the pain and anxiety are headwinds blowing from China and other emerging markets, where growth is slowing and demand for the raw materials that drive the global economy has dried up.Even as the American economy continues to plow ahead, nerves are increasingly on edge. Investors and banks that lent eagerly to energy and mining giants when prices were high are worried about whether they will be repaid if prices stay low. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said in late September it would cut up to 10,000 jobs, a casualty of falling demand for its trademark yellow bulldozers and excavators.A few days after Caterpillar\u2019s decision, Alcoa announced it would split in two to help cope with the slide in aluminum prices. DuPont, which has been under pressure to perform a similar breakup because of weak chemical prices, said in early October that its chief executive was stepping down and that it would cut costs more aggressively.In Texas, energy companies and other natural resource businesses have eliminated 25,000 jobs this year. Sparsely populated North Dakota, where fortunes soared with the shale oil fracking boom, has lost more than 10,000 jobs, with some of its hastily built new housing now empty.For the farm belt, which largely sidestepped the damage wreaked by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the economic turnabout has been especially sharp. The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm income, adjusted for inflation, will fall 54 percent from where it was two years ago \u2014 the third-lowest level since the 1980s. Corn, the most valuable crop in the country, has fallen to $3.78 a bushel from $7.50 three years ago.\u201cI think a lot of farmers are starting to realize that these price levels may not be temporary,\u201d said Nathan Kauffman, the Omaha branch executive with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.Still, for all the rising fears across the nation\u2019s midsection, the end of the long boom in commodities cuts both ways. Unlike the housing bust, which benefited no one but a few prescient short-sellers, the price collapse has a countervailing positive impact for consumers and some other businesses.The 37 percent drop in gasoline prices since the summer of 2014 is the equivalent of a $100 billion tax cut, providing much-needed relief while wages remain stuck. Food prices, too, have declined, with chicken costing 8 percent less than a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Milk is cheaper, and prices of goods from abroad, like coffee, are down.Airlines are rejoicing at lower prices for fuel, which makes up 40 percent of their costs. For the first time in years, airlines can buy new planes, invest in new facilities and give bonuses to employees, while paying dividends to shareholders. With gasoline prices low, automakers are raking in healthy profits from selling shiny new pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u201cThere are winners and there are losers,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research firm that tracks the economy. \u201cBut there is no question that there are pockets of real pain out there.\u201dCommodity producers are used to regular booms and busts, but the so-called supercycle driven by China\u2019s once insatiable appetite for raw materials has been extraordinary by any standard. Edward L. Morse, Citigroup\u2019s global head of commodities research, likens China\u2019s boom to the three decades after World War II when Europe was rebuilt, or the Gilded Age industrialization of the United States in the half-century after the Civil War.\u201cThe last 20 years have been mind-boggling,\u201d Mr. Morse said. \u201cBetween 1993 and 2013, China built 200 cities of a million people or more. This was incredibly intensive in terms of steel and copper and other commodities.\u201dVast amounts of money were invested globally to increase commodity production, whether it meant digging for iron and aluminum ores in Brazil and Australia or developing once untappable sources of shale oil and natural gas in the United States. In the first decade of the 21st century, Mr. Morse said, spending on energy exploration and drilling rose sevenfold.\u201cThere was a bunching up of capital spending across the planet,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was an incredible marshaling of resources to find and get new anything. And like those infrastructure booms in the past, it is coming to an end.\u201dAnd from South America to South Africa and beyond, the cooling in China adds up to an economic freeze. The double whammy of lower exports to China and falling commodity prices has pummeled the Brazilian economy, the world\u2019s seventh largest; its currency has fallen by roughly one-third against the dollar this year.Closer to home, in Assumption, Ill., and in tiny farm towns like it across the Midwest, the lean years have arrived. But as in the biblical Book of Genesis, seven fat years preceded them.For all the economic suffering elsewhere, the farm sector came through the Great Recession largely unscathed. Harvests were bountiful, prices for corn and soybeans were buoyant, and low interest rates made it easy to borrow and buy land or new equipment.\u201cMy people weren\u2019t exposed,\u201d said Tom Sloan, chief executive of Sloan Implement, a major dealer of John Deere tractors, combines and other farm equipment with 20 stores in Illinois and Wisconsin. \u201cAll my friends were saying how tough things were, but farmers had zero.\u201dFarmers like Terry Albrecht, who grows corn and soybeans on the same 600-acre plot in Staunton, Ill., that his father and grandfather once tilled, used the windfall from high prices to upgrade his grain truck and other equipment. In July, he took a break from the farm and went to Hawaii for two weeks with his wife and daughter.He admits it may be a while before he can take that kind of trip again. \u201cAt these prices, I wouldn\u2019t be spending that kind of money,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said. \u201cYou take the opportunity when it arises.\u201dAs was the case with other commodities, overseas demand pushed crop prices steadily higher, especially as consumers in emerging markets began emulating Western eating habits.Wheat exports from the United States to China in 2014 were four times what they were in 2011, while prices doubled before dropping more recently. Beijing prohibits the import of American beef, but exports to Hong Kong have surged, and the meat is smuggled into mainland China.As crop prices have dived, so have sales of new John Deere machines in the territory Mr. Sloan serves. New equipment purchases are down about 30 percent from a year ago, he said, with the used tractors and combines he normally takes as trade-ins now filling nearly all of the five-acre lot at his company\u2019s headquarters in Assumption.\u201cFarmers made so much money they all bought new equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the supply of used equipment is astronomical.\u201dAnd just as Mr. Sloan\u2019s sales are down, so is overall business at John Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., a three-hour drive from Assumption. The company has laid off roughly 1,500 workers in the last year, and earnings were down 40 percent last quarter.Mr. Sloan takes the long view \u2014 the company was founded by his grandfather in 1931. \u201cWe are in a cyclical business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good times lasted longer than we thought, and we probably have a couple of years of lean times ahead.\u201dNow that the boom has ended, bankruptcies in the agricultural sector may tick up, but no one is predicting a replay of the 1980s when many farmers and rural banks went under. The biggest differences this time, they say, are overall low debt levels and historically cheap borrowing costs.But banking regulators and others are closely watching a steady rise in short-term agricultural operating loans over the last year.\u201cAt $3.50 a bushel, if your land is paid off, you\u2019re probably making a little bit of taxable income,\u201d said David Miller, the director of research and commodity services for the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation. If you\u2019re renting land at $300 an acre, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re probably losing money.\u201dNortheast of the factories and bleak industrial vistas in Granite City, the landscape in Madison County, Ill., quickly turns to rolling, amber-colored farmland. And for farmers in the area, the Hamel Coop Grain Company in rural Hamel is a place to sell or store their harvest, and a hangout to trade gossip and talk business.And these days, the conversations inevitably turn to prices, which are displayed on a whiteboard that Amy Rogier, the general manager, updates every afternoon with the latest figures from the Chicago Board of Trade.Two years ago, soybeans fetched more than $15 a bushel. The co-op is offering $8.90 now. Corn was $6.93 a bushel in 2012. It now trades at $3.78.\u201cNone of them are happy with the prices,\u201d said Ms. Rogier, who grew up on a farm in the area, which her father and brother still run. The co-op offers lower-priced seed, and she says farmers are using less fertilizer, to accommodate tighter budgets.As he delivered 600 bushels of soybeans for sale this month, John Vieth made no bones about the pain he is feeling. He said he would have preferred to store the beans in the hope of getting a higher price in a few months but needed the money now to pay bills that could not wait.\u201cIt hurts, it hurts big time,\u201d Mr. Vieth said after the crop was unloaded from his Navistar International truck. \u201cEquipment is so dang expensive. Everything is up but our prices.\u201dAs the season wraps up, the speed of the drop in what farmers are now getting for their harvest means big-ticket purchases are being delayed.\u201cInstead of a new tractor, I can make do with a used one,\u201d said Kenny Grotefendt, as he watched his just-harvested corn being loaded into one of the co-op\u2019s towering silos. \u201cI\u2019ll be 66 on Oct. 24 and my wife wants me to retire. But I was born on a farm, and it gets in your blood. I\u2019ll farm till I\u2019m 70 and then enjoy life.\u201dLike the used farm equipment sitting on the lot at Mr. Sloan\u2019s dealerships, the first thing a visitor sees around the Granite City steelworks is mound after mound of coal. This is what\u2019s known in the steel industry as coke \u2014 carbonized coal that is used to melt iron ore and refine it into hardened steel.With only one of Granite City\u2019s blast furnaces operating, the plant is running at about half of its normal capacity of 2.8 million tons of steel a year. Companywide, United States Steel is using 58 percent of its production capacity, which means lots of coke has no place to go.Some of the steel produced in Granite City is used in construction and for machinery and other equipment, but the largest single share is earmarked for what is known in the industry as O.C.T.G., or Oil Country Tubular Goods.From early 2011 to mid-2014, when oil mostly traded from $90 to $110 a barrel, Granite City shipped coil after coil of steel to the United States Steel plant in Lone Star, Tex., where it was turned into the tubes that line new oil wells and other so-called down-hole products.Crude oil\u2019s abrupt drop to $40 to $50 a barrel for most of 2015 has forced the industry to decommission more than half its rigs. In mid-October, 595 oil rigs were in operation, compared with 1,590 a year ago.But there is a hidden overhang in the market. To keep their leases, many operators are drilling wells without completing them. That means that as soon as prices revive a bit, production may bubble up again, forcing prices back down.As a result, the financial consequences for banks and other lenders to the energy industry are growing \u2014 and the pressure will only mount if oil remains in the $45 range.Loans that not so long ago seemed safe now appear riskier: The collateral underpinning many of the loans held by banks is gas and oil reserves. As the price of oil has fallen, so has the value of the commodity guaranteeing the loan.Banks have started to set aside money to cover bad loans made to energy companies.For the last four quarters, the Texas bank Comerica has increased the reserves it has set aside for bad loans to energy and energy-related companies, which total around $3.8 billion, roughly 8 percent of total loans held by the bank. In mid-October, Comerica reported that it had nearly doubled to $1.1 billion the pool of energy loans it classifies as \u201ccriticized,\u201d meaning the bank has concerns about the borrowers\u2019 financial condition.Even as they cope with the drop in demand from the oil patch, American steel makers are being pummeled by a flood of imported steel from foreign producers, especially South Korea.United States Steel has filed a trade case against Korean steel makers, claiming they are dumping steel at less than half of what it costs to make it. By the time the case is resolved, however, the furnaces in Granite City may already be cold.\u201cThere is typically about four months\u2019 inventory of O.C.T.G. out there,\u201d said Douglas R. Matthews, senior vice president for North American flat-rolled operations at United States Steel. \u201cRight now it\u2019s 10 to 12 months, and high levels of Korean steel are still coming in.\u201dBut the flip side of the commodity cycle is that some previous losers are now riding high.The surge in commodity prices drove a transformation in the airline industry, for example, as high fuel prices prodded carriers to merge, reduce capacity and park planes that were not economical to fly.Today, with their biggest cost down substantially, the airline industry is reporting historic levels of profitability.That roller coaster effect will eventually play out within the commodities sector itself. With prices depressed, so is capital spending aimed at finding new deposits of oil or extracting minerals from new mines. Eventually, supply will adjust to better fit demand, setting the stage for prices to stabilize and, over time, recover.Some signs indicate that the commodity bust is hitting bottom. But many analysts predict that oil prices, in particular, will stay low for an unusually long period, as the industry slowly works off a huge glut of supplies and inventories.Much as that might cheer many American consumers, in Granite City and towns like it up and down the middle of the country, that prospect brings little joy.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that what\u2019s good at the pump is bad for me,\u201d said Jason Chism, president of Local 50 of the United Steelworkers in Granite City. \u201cBut I\u2019m not happy. We\u2019re laying guys off, and the steel industry is in the tank.\u201dNeither is Mr. McCabe, the second-generation steelworker, who is preparing for the worst. Not long ago, he asked a real estate agent to visit his home in Gillespie, Ill., and give him an estimate on the property. \u201cIf the plant is idled, I\u2019d sell everything and start over,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a good credit rating, and I don\u2019t want to lose that. I could get a job for $10 to $15 an hour.\u201dThat is a lot less than the roughly $25 an hour he makes at United States Steel, but Mr. McCabe knows the business has changed since his father and uncle worked in the blast furnace decades ago.\u201cIt\u2019s good money when we\u2019re making steel,\u201d he added, sitting for an interview in the century-old local union hall known as the Labor Temple. \u201cBut our pay has already been cut as production has gone down, and we\u2019re constantly dipping into savings. What can we do about it? Nothing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated which book of the Bible speaks of seven fat years preceding seven lean years.

{"Headline": "Silver Crystal\u2019s Strategy to Reach the Fan for All Seasons", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrototypeIn the winter of 2004, a labor dispute between the National Hockey League\u2019s owners and players led to the unprecedented cancellation of an entire season. Players didn\u2019t lace up their skates, and arenas sat empty for some 1,200 scheduled games.For Adam Crystal, a Toronto businessman, the lost season didn\u2019t just deal a blow to his social life and his personal identity as a Toronto Maple Leafs devotee; it was also a huge setback to his business.At the time, his company was called Alpha Crests, and it had recently installed what Mr. Crystal called \u201cmicrofactories\u201d in N.H.L. arenas across North America to allow hockey fans attending games to buy customized team jerseys on the spot. Alpha Crests provided the letters and numbers, along with pressing machines and training for store sales employees. During a game, fans could walk into a stadium store and have their favorite player\u2019s name, or their own name or nickname, pressed onto a team jersey using the microfactories. A salesperson would take the order and operate the pressing machine.When the hockey strike hit, the market for Mr. Crystal\u2019s products plummeted, and his microfactories lay fallow. \u201cThey ended up collecting dust for a year,\u201d he said.As co-chief executives of the company, they acted based on lessons that Mr. Crystal learned from the N.H.L. strike. To protect themselves from the vulnerabilities of a single-sport business, they expanded beyond hockey, signing licensing agreements with the National Basketball Association, National Football League and Majestic Athletic apparel, the official jersey supplier of Major League Baseball. It was a move that served them well in 2011 when N.B.A. players and owners were embroiled in a five-month labor dispute that delayed the start of the season.Silver Crystal Group, the parent of Silver Crystal Sports, sells the Fanzones kiosks to retailers for $5,000 to $100,000, and the kiosks are customizable, too. For some retailers that order a large quantity of letters and numbers, the company provides the kiosks at no additional charge.Mr. Crystal and Mr. Silver call their kiosks retail entertainment, because buyers can play with the touch screens; the custom production process takes up to 10 minutes. But there\u2019s a practical side to the kiosks as well. The system is meant to blunt the financial blow that retailers experience when certain jersey inventories become obsolete, such as when a popular player is traded to a different team or a player is convicted of a crime. For instance, sales of the N.F.L. quarterback Michael Vick\u2019s jerseys decreased sharply after his arrest on charges of running a dogfighting ring. Instead of printing thousands of jerseys with players\u2019 names and numbers, retailers can leave the jerseys blank until the orders roll in.The kiosks can also allow store owners to nimbly respond to demand for jerseys when a player experiences a surprise hot streak (think Jeremy Lin when he played for the New York Knicks) or is signed or traded to a team, according to Mr. Crystal and Mr. Silver. When the N.B.A. player LeBron James returned to Cleveland, Silver Crystal Sports did a \u201cmassive, massive\u201d amount of business selling numbers and letters for new jerseys bearing his name, Mr. Silver said.The customized jerseys cost $20 to $95 more than blank standard jerseys, depending on the complexity of the design. At the more elaborate and expensive end of the spectrum are the snakeskin-patterned letters and numbers that the kiosks churned out at the baseball All-Star Game in Arizona a few years ago.This month, the company is introducing a smartphone ordering system to let fans customize and order jerseys without having to leave their seats during a game. Some retailers will deliver the jerseys to the customer\u2019s seat, and others will require them to go to the closest kiosk to try on the jersey and pay for it.But it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to lure fans to games, according to Professor Carter of the Sports Business Institute. This is partly because tickets are expensive and improvements in television-screen technology have enhanced the home viewing of sports. So \u201cteams and leagues are doing whatever they can to make sure the game-day experience is a real experience,\u201d Professor Carter said. Memorializing a game you attended with a custom jersey might be one way to do that, he said.While Mr. Silver and Mr. Crystal consider the sports industry to be recession-proof, that\u2019s not necessarily true, Professor Carter says. Jerseys are among the costliest items in sports stores. For instance, noncustomized adult-size LeBron James Cleveland Cavaliers jerseys cost $70 to $110; New York Yankees jerseys can cost more than $200. And when times are tight, fans sometimes scale back on large expenditures.\u201cThe discretionary spending of avid sports fans remains very, very strong, but it\u2019s not immune from cutbacks,\u201d Professor Carter said. \u201cOnce the price point gets high, and the economy is struggling, people say, \u2018O.K., what\u2019s the real value in this?\u2019 \u201d Instead of buying two jerseys, they might purchase one, he said.If Mr. Crystal learned anything from the aftermath of the N.H.L. strike, it\u2019s that diversification is crucial to his business. He says that his company is not limited to sports and that it can customize any type of feature in a retail environment. He envisions Fanzones-style kiosks in a variety of places. If a restaurant wants kiosks for customized burgers, for example, \u201cwe can build that technology for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our next frontier.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Turks Prepare to Vote, Polls Point to Inconclusive Result and More Instability", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnalysts here saw all of that as a clear sign that Mr. Erdogan was cementing his support with nationalists and seeking to marginalize the Kurdish opposition party that hurt him in the June election. But as Turks warily prepare to vote again in a snap parliamentary election on Sunday, little is expected to change at the polls: Most projections hold that, again, no party will win a majority.If that is the case, Turkey could face even more political instability while the economy is faltering, and while the country is fighting a war with Kurdish militants and facing increased security threats from the Islamic State. And as always, the spotlight will be on Mr. Erdogan, who has been the country\u2019s dominant political force for more than a decade.\u201cHe has shown that he is willing to go very far to keep in power,\u201d said Svante E. Cornell, the research director at the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and an expert on Turkey. \u201cI see him finding ways, which are more or less unconstitutional, to continue to maintain his power, whether by announcing another election or some form of temporary government. I have a hard time seeing him accept the reality and going in to some form of coalition.\u201dAs the country has become more polarized, with dividing lines between Islamists, secular Turks, nationalists and Kurds becoming ever sharper, no one seems eager for another election. And politics, once a national obsession, has become an almost taboo subject.\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve had heated debates with my customers, but now people are so divided that you can\u2019t even talk about the political agenda,\u201d said Onder Kabak, 51, a barber who lives in Besiktas, a largely secular district of Istanbul. \u201cThe Ankara bombing was the tipping point. Without a transparent investigation, everyone has come to their own conclusions over who was behind it, based on their ideology and choice of political party.\u201dAround noon on a recent day, Aydin Ozpetek was getting his hair cut in Mr. Kabak\u2019s barbershop. \u201cNo one wants to go to another election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are all forced to because Erdogan wasn\u2019t happy with the last result.\u201dEver so briefly, the June election results were hailed as a victory for Turkish democracy. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist party, the Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., had been in control for more than a decade. Suddenly, it appeared that it would be forced to share power.The result in June effectively blocked Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ambition of establishing an executive presidency.This time, while not remaining silent, Mr. Erdogan has campaigned less robustly than he did before the June election, when his aggressive and divisive rhetoric seemed to backfire. His party earned about 41 percent of the vote \u2014 still the largest share, but not a majority, and down from about 50 percent in the last national election in 2011.In public appearances, he has framed this election as a choice between \u201cstability and chaos,\u201d and his party\u2019s campaign motto this time around was \u201cTurkey\u2019s road map to serenity and stability.\u201d\u201cThere are those who can\u2019t handle Turkey getting stronger,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said last month. \u201cThese people exist both within and outside our borders. In order to not let them get away with their designs, I firmly believe that the upcoming election on Nov. 1 will be a vote between stability and chaos.\u201dAmid renewed fears over terrorist attacks, depleted party campaign budgets and voter fatigue, it was hard even to notice in recent weeks that the country was preparing for a national election. There were few large-scale rallies, and the colorful party flags are scarcer even in big cities.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the budget for big election campaigns,\u201d said Sezgi Onay, a member of the Republican People\u2019s Party, the main secular opposition party, in Istanbul.She added: \u201cThe voters and campaign volunteers are tired, too. No one is in the mood for another election, especially after the terrorist attack in Ankara.\u201dAt a recent rally in Istanbul held by the A.K.P., but not attended by Mr. Erdogan, thousands showed up, although the attendance was noticeably smaller than at gatherings held before the June election.\u201cPeople are worried about security because of the Ankara terrorist attacks,\u201d said Sevket Basusta, 23, a member of the A.K.P.\u2019s youth branch. \u201cMaybe more people would have come if Erdogan held the rally, but this isn\u2019t just about him anymore. People want stability and security, and they know that the only way they can achieve that is through a single-handed A.K.P. government.\u201dThe other morning, Ayhan Yildiz, a 30-year-old engineer, turned on his television and saw riot police officers storming the offices of the Koza Ipek media group, while the news anchor of the Bugun news channel narrated the events. Scuffles broke out as the police \u2014 enforcing a court order to seize the channel, based on charges of supporting terrorism that critics saw as a politically motivated move to silence free expression \u2014 arrested journalists and executives. By the end of the day, the channel had gone black.Hours later, standing outside Bugun\u2019s office, which was surrounded by police officers wielding plastic shields and tear-gas guns, Mr. Yildiz explained why he had once voted for Mr. Erdogan but would no longer. Like many, he believes Turkey is slipping from a Western-style democracy \u2014 he noted that Mr. Erdogan, in his early years in power, promoted membership in the European Union \u2014 toward a Middle East-style autocracy.\u201cHe was a supporter of the E.U. in his first years,\u201d Mr. Yildiz said. \u201cAfter he got more and more power, he decided to be a dictator.\u201dThe police raid was a vivid example of the government\u2019s crackdown on two of its perceived enemies just before the election: the opposition news media and followers of the exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, a onetime ally of Mr. Erdogan who now opposes him and who was said to be close to gaining ownership of the closed news channel.After the raid, a photograph of a bloodied press card held by one of the channel\u2019s journalists went viral. Opposition politicians rushed to the scene, using it as an opportunity to campaign. The Kurdish leader, Selahattin Demirtas, was interviewed on Bugun and denounced the \u201cmafia-like\u201d tactics of the government. And Emma Sinclair-Webb, the Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch, wrote, \u201cNot since the days of the 1980 military coup have there been such dramatic moves to close down and prevent scrutiny of power.\u201dMr. Yildiz was asked what would happen after the vote if the result is the same as in June.He paused and then said, \u201cGod knows.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Death Comes, and the Obituary Quickly Follows", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat appeared to readers as if it happened in minutes was a product of work that began Aug. 1, 2007, when Mr. Markoff sketched out the first words of his obit:Steven P. Jobs, a child of Silicon Valley and a college dropout who reshaped the world\u2019s culture around personal computing and digital media, died X and the age of X. The cause of death was X according to X.The next four years involved constant monitoring and updating. \u201cA year before Steve died, I saw that a Bloomberg obituary had accidentally leaked onto the Internet,\u201d Mr. Markoff recalled. \u201cThe lead quote on Steve Jobs\u2019s death was from Bill Gates. I thought about that and decided that that was canonically wrong. Steve would not have wanted Bill to have the last word.\u201dMr. Markoff approached Andrew S. Grove, a former Intel chairman, for an overarching summation of a career that had not yet ended. Conscious of his own mortality, Mr. Grove demurred. So Mr. Markoff turned to Regis McKenna, who had helped shape the Apple brand. He obliged with a great quotation.Editors had the last word, however, and gave Mr. Gates the first words in the obit. Otherwise, the journey to screens and into print was smooth. \u201cI was at a business dinner downtown, got an alert and went straight back into the Times office,\u201d Mr. Lohr said. \u201cNot much to do.

{"Headline": "The Archive of Eating", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Food IssueWheaton, who is 84, has inquiring eyes, a soft, wry voice and gray hair held back with bobby pins. She is the author of the 1983 book \u2018\u2018Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table From 1300 to 1789,\u2019\u2019 a superb history of gastronomy in France spritzed with darts of wit, like lemon juice on a fillet of turbot. For 25 years, she worked as a curator of the culinary collection at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies in Cambridge, Mass., and I\u2019ve known her for about half that time through our shared interest in food history. Over lunch, she exudes a humorous intelligence, greeting each dish with appetite and her companions with warmth. She does not seem remotely obsessive. But for half a century, she has quietly pursued a project of single-minded devotion \u2014 a database called \u2018\u2018The Cook\u2019s Oracle,\u2019\u2019 in which she intends to log every recipe, ingredient and technique in the vast majority of all the cookbooks published in America and Europe.The DB \u2014 Wheaton\u2019s fond nickname for her outlandishly ambitious undertaking \u2014 starts with medieval manuscripts like \u2018\u2018The Forme of Cury,\u2019\u2019 a collection penned on vellum in the 14th century. (Typical recipe: pottage of gourds, a kind of braised pumpkin with saffron.) It provisionally ends in the early 20th century, with instructions for such dishes as \u2018\u2018Improved Sausage,\u2019\u2019 by Mrs. Clara Ware (the improvement is to add a \u2018\u2018heaping teaspoonful\u2019\u2019 of ground cloves to the sausage meat). In theory, more modern and non-Western books could be added as well; once complete, Wheaton\u2019s database would enable scholars and cooks alike to search for every apple pie recipe ever written, every slice of toast, every technique for mashing potatoes, every subtle variation in knife work, every cinnamon stick. The point of collating so many old recipes is not to salvage actual dishes but rather to understand the aspirations that lay behind them: to see the different flavor combinations cooks craved or the things they worried about in the kitchen. The database could let us glimpse, as Wheaton puts it, the whole \u2018\u2018complex kaleidoscope\u2019\u2019 of what food has meant to people.And another:The germ for the database first came to Wheaton in 1962. Her husband, Bob, was studying for his Ph.D. at Harvard, and her two children (the third had not yet been born) were in preschool five days a week for three hours (\u2018\u2018assuming no bugs, earaches or other interruptions\u2019\u2019). Wheaton had done graduate studies in art history, but she discovered that what she really wanted to do was read old cookbooks.One day, she found herself trying to get her head around an excess of confusingly similar yet distinct medieval blancmange recipes in four languages. Blancmange \u2014 which means \u2018\u2018white food\u2019\u2019 \u2014 referred to a family of recipes in which pale mixtures were casseroled together into a pap, often with rice and almond milk. There were blancmanges of lobster and capon; of pike, carp and haddock. Wheaton sketched out a table representing different blancmange recipes on a piece of three-ring notebook paper and found that she could make sense of them only \u2018\u2018as long as I kept staring at the paper.\u2019\u2019 She moved on to French cookbooks of the 17th and 18th centuries and tried to organize the data they contained by taking notes on each recipe one by one. But when she returned to these notes, she was frustrated. She couldn\u2019t grasp the character of the books.In the 1970s Wheaton discovered McBee cards. They were a primitive data system, in which different pieces of information could be encoded by punching holes to designate broad categories (date, gender, country). \u2018\u2018After the cards are properly punched, whole packs of them can be searched by running a knitting needle through the desired hole in the pack and lifting it up,\u2019\u2019 Wheaton explained in a talk last summer at a food symposium held at Oxford. \u2018\u2018When, if one is lucky, gems of information will drop out.\u2019\u2019 McBee cards had obvious limitations, however. \u2018\u2018My categories kept expanding, and the cards did not.\u2019\u2019 Wheaton tried to improve the cards by adding color-coded edges, but then she ran out of colors.In 1982, Wheaton set aside her knitting needles and switched to computers, buying the first IBM PC, which could produce accented letters. (\u2018\u2018Apple scorned such frippery,\u2019\u2019 Wheaton said. \u2018\u2018I believe they thought accented letters were like ice cream cones with sprinkles.\u2019\u2019) After using and abandoning two database programs, she settled on Microsoft Access and has been using it ever since. \u2018\u2018It is possible to search for fungi or for morels, and to search for courgettes and also get zucchini,\u2019\u2019 she said. It\u2019s Wheaton\u2019s hope that someday a friendly library or other research institution will take on the database and make it open for everyone to search.For half a century, Barbara Ketcham Wheaton has devoted herself to building an archive of\u00a0every recipe, ingredient and technique in the vast majority of all the cookbooks published in America and Europe.I asked her if she ever lost herself in all the data. \u2018\u2018Oh, yes, oh, yes!\u2019\u2019 she exclaimed, her voice almost purring. She likes to describe her database as \u2018\u2018a cross between a Swiss Army knife and a piano.\u2019\u2019 It can do all sorts of handy little jobs, but it can also produce music. The music is the patterns it reveals about the vast human enterprise of cooking.It can haul up such forgotten delicacies as artificial asses\u2019 milk (fake donkey milk, a health food made from rose jam, candy and sea holly) or tansy, a bitter herb that was once used in desserts, like our vanilla extract. Or pulpatoon, a ragout made of an excess of ingredients including pigeons, mushrooms and pistachio nuts. Or what about asparagus chopped small, to disguise it as green peas? No one would attempt this trick now that peas come cheap from the freezer.Some of the delightful morsels prompt the thought: Why did we stop regularly cooking that? The globe artichoke, for instance. Across Europe, cooks of the 16th to the 18th centuries recognized this ornate vegetable for a great treat. The DB lists multiple iterations of artichoke pie, lavishly layered with truffles. Artichokes were boiled, braised or fried; served in a cream sauce; or simply cooked and dressed and eaten leaf by delicious leaf. Outside Italy, artichokes no longer inspire such intense worship, and our eating is the poorer for it. They belong to a more civilized, less puritanical way of life, demanding to be savored slowly, possibly with large quantities of butter.You will look in vain here for cilantro or feta. Instead, you\u2019ll find mutton: page after page of mutton recipes, from chops to hash to jelly to mutton broth for the sick. Croissants are present, but only in the recipes from France. There is a single American avocado recipe, from 1887 (for a salad with mayonnaise and onions), but the fruit is called \u2018\u2018alligator pear.\u2019\u2019 The recipe\u2019s author, Maria Parloa, assumes it is so rare we need to be told where to buy one (at a store on Fulton Street in New York, she suggests, where they cost 15 to 20 cents apiece, or around $4 to $5 in today\u2019s money). You start to see that so much of what we think of as personal taste is really a question of what\u2019s available in any given market. To be an avocado eater in 1887 was as eccentric a proclivity as being a mutton lover today.Scenes of kitchens very unlike ours materialize, full of strange utensils like salamanders (long-handled tools for broiling), croquette molds and fluted knives for cutting root vegetables into fancy shapes. There are unusual cooking methods, like in an 18th-century recipe for beefsteak panbroiled over a fire made from two newspapers. Without kitchen timers or thermometers, the DB\u2019s cooks were often forced to be ingenious in measuring when a dish was done: \u2018\u2018until the bones are ready to fall out,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018until you can run a straw into the skin,\u2019\u2019 until \u2018\u2018the milk tastes of spice,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018till it be soft and limber.\u2019\u2019 They used their senses more acutely than we do.The more fragments Wheaton collects, the more cookbooks reveal their variety, and also their mystery. There is no universal cookbook, only a tower of Babel where no cook fully speaks the language of any other. However imperfectly, the database helps decode these fragmentary snatches of dialogue: not just the ingredients of the soup, or the pot it was cooked in, but also the values of the person who prepared it. \u2018\u2018I had to learn to listen to the writer\u2019s side of the conversation with his or her reader,\u2019\u2019 Wheaton says.This is sometimes hard, because the assumptions of cooks in the past were so utterly different from our own. An American cookbook from 1881 includes many recipes for marble cake, but almost no verbs, because the authors assumed that the method for marbling batter was common knowledge. Amelia Simmons, in 1796, imagines that we will have a cow on hand that we can milk straight into a dish of cider and sugar to make a syllabub, a frothy dessert: \u2018\u2018milk your cow into your liquor\u2019\u2019 she calmly directs, as if it were something normal \u2014 and for her, it was.Today, the vulnerability is precisely what interests Wheaton. She herself grew up in an affluent family on the outskirts of Philadelphia \u2014 there was a fine kitchen garden and a cook \u2014 but her grandfather came from a family of poverty-stricken farmers. Even though he went on to become a successful businessman, he kept the habits of scarcity. He saved. He mended furniture. \u2018\u2018He understood people who didn\u2019t have any money,\u2019\u2019 she told me. She began using cookbooks to reconstruct people\u2019s lives, \u2018\u2018even if they weren\u2019t wonderful.\u2019\u2019One of the more startling patterns is the difference between cookbooks written by men and women before the 20th century. Wheaton says she has come to see them as almost two separate cuisines. Male chefs \u2014 who had professional status \u2014 were mainly concerned with how to satisfy a master\u2019s jaded palate. It was said that ancien r\u00e9gime French chefs aspired to give fish the flavor of meat, meat the flavor of fish and vegetables no flavor at all. Robert May in \u2018\u2018The Accomplisht Cook\u2019\u2019 (1660) urges his readers to use only the best: \u2018\u2018fine flour,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018good thick sweet cream,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018handsome\u2019\u2019 fishes. By contrast, the women\u2019s books are much humbler. They include such compromises as \u2018\u2018cheap rice pudding\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018cheaper fruitcake.\u2019\u2019 These are books about what to do when life gives you lemons \u2014 or when it gives you mediocre ingredients and limited time. The female authors assume that their readers, who are servants or wives, will be managing the cooking alongside other household tasks like the laundry and child care. Their recipes often display a brutal pragmatism. Mrs. Randolph\u2019s \u2018\u2018The Virginia Housewife\u2019\u2019 (1824) has a recipe for chicken soup \u2014 soup of \u2018\u2018old fowl\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that starts with keeping the bird in a coop for two weeks before killing it and chopping it up, discarding the back because it is \u2018\u2018too gross and strong for use.\u2019\u2019One of Wheaton\u2019s favorite books in the DB is \u2018\u2018The Frugal Housewife,\u2019\u2019 first published in 1829 (later editions added \u2018\u2018American\u2019\u2019 to the title). The writer was Lydia Maria Child, who was also a campaigner against slavery and for women\u2019s rights. Child\u2019s cookbook, Wheaton said, is a \u2018\u2018slice of life as lived by unprosperous New Englanders in the 1820s and \u201930s.\u2019\u2019 Some of her recipes remain appealing, like her simple dish of tomatoes stewed with butter and salt. But the book as a whole is pervaded with penny-pinching. The best economy with coffee, Child advises, is to \u2018\u2018go without.\u2019\u2019 Child commends cupcakes, not because she likes them \u2014 no \u2018\u2018Sex and the City\u2019\u2019-style indulgence here \u2014 but because they are less expensive than poundcake. She recommends asking friends in the country to buy lard for us when it is cheapest. \u2018\u2018Economical people,\u2019\u2019 writes Child, \u2018\u2018will seldom use preserves, except for sickness.\u2019\u2019 The entire book contains almost no seasonings.Lydia Child was helping her readers envisage a life of financial security, in which, with a little resourcefulness, the lard would not run out. When Wheaton teaches a seminar on how to read a cookbook, she always uses \u2018\u2018The Frugal Housewife,\u2019\u2019 and people \u2018\u2018almost always dislike it.\u2019\u2019 We do not recognize ourselves in Child\u2019s remedies. For many of us, stressed by work, the impossible dream is not to eat preserves but to switch off the screen long enough to make them. We clip ever more recipes: our own personal database, talismans of a more leisurely existence. As Wheaton has found, the urge to read cookbooks is not always the same as the urge to cook.Food books touch more of human life than what happens at the stove. The first cookbooks were sometimes called books of secrets, in which remedies for toothache or the plague jostled with recipes for roast meats, puddings and tarts. When I typed \u2018\u2018easy\u2019\u2019 into the database, it offered me not just an easy crust for family pies but also an easy way to make ink and a method for trying to encourage an easy childbirth. (For the latter, E. Smith in 1727 recommended a concoction of raisins, figs, licorice and anise seeds boiled in spring water, imbibed morning and evening six weeks before the baby is due.)Cookbook readers today would be disconcerted to be offered a cure for deafness or \u2018\u2018fumes in the head\u2019\u2019 alongside instructions for puff pastry. Yet recipes are all still remedies in some form or other \u2014 everyday enchantments for making life better. Cookbooks show us at our most defenseless because they expose things we believe we lack: meringues that don\u2019t fall; soup that will fill us up without making us fat; dinners that cook in no time at all. They allow us to imagine ourselves as bountiful hosts or artisanal pastry makers. It isn\u2019t all fantasy, though. Cookbooks also speak to, and soothe, something real: the hunger that started when we were babies, when food and security were one and the same.The nature of Wheaton\u2019s database is that it can never be finished, at least not by one octogenarian working alone. Even if she were to go well beyond the 3,400 books by more than 6,000 authors that she has already cataloged, the project would comprise merely the edge of a vast hinterland that we can never access: the billions of unremarked bowls of stew, the bakers who toiled alone, the long-vanished food markets. Most cooks, especially female ones, have been illiterate, unable to record their kitchen experience. Wheaton has found just nine surviving Italian cookbooks by women from before 1900. It is as if all those nonnas rolling gnocchi and cutting tagliatelle never existed. The books she is collecting in her database are all that remain of the vast human conversation about food. All we can do is gather up the fragments and try to decipher what comforts they once held.A few weeks ago, I got a new cookbook by Nigel Slater, \u2018\u2018A Year of Good Eating.\u2019\u2019 I can\u2019t pretend I needed it, though it does look lovely on the kitchen shelf in its calm blue cover. So far, I\u2019ve cooked only one of the recipes, for hazelnut-maple cookies, though I have my eye on many more, if I can only find the time: a dish of wet polenta and winter greens, a piece of cod crusted with pumpkin seeds and dill. It makes me feel oddly reassured to have all this kitchen wisdom stored up, like jars of jelly in a pantry. Recipes can feel like charms against life\u2019s disappointments or protection against the onward march of the years. You never know exactly when they will be called for.Bee Wilson is the author of \u201cFirst Bite: How We Learn to Eat,\u201d which will be published in the United States on Dec. 1.Advertisement"}

Widely condemned by Western governments, he is considered one of the most uncompromising rulers in Africa.Now he can claim the honor of being awarded a Confucius Peace Prize, the Chinese answer to the Nobel Peace Prize.A group based in Hong Kong that says it is the official organizer of the prize has selected Mr. Mugabe as this year\u2019s recipient. Among the finalists for the award were Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, President Park Geun-Hye of South Korea and Bill Gates.The Confucius Peace Prize ceremony is scheduled to be held in December.

He brought benefit to the people of Zimbabwe.\u201dMr. Mugabe had his start in politics as a Pan-African nationalist who opposed minority white rule in the former British colony and country then known as Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The Rhodesian government used brutal tactics to try to suppress nationalist movements, and Mr. Mugabe was imprisoned for more than 10 years, but the country finally achieved full independence from Britain in 1980.Mr. Mugabe became premier and quickly set up an authoritarian system, including managing security forces that on occasion acted as death squads.\u201cAs the president of Zimbabwe or the chairman of the African Union, he has always been pushing forward the cause of peace in Africa,\u201d Mr. Qiao said. \u201cHe has been working hard even in his 90s. This shows he has ideals in his heart. He has been trying to support the independence of Africa. He has his \u2018African Dream.\u2019\u00a0\u201dCritics in Zimbabwe and elsewhere were swift to condemn the honor given to Mr. Mugabe.Mr. Qiao said he did not blame Mr. Mugabe for the soaring inflation that has crippled the country\u2019s economy.\u201cZimbabwe is a relatively small country in southern Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for the country to experience economic downturns for several or more than a dozen years.

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s New Rule Would Ease Strain From Dying Banks", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Rodham Clinton said this week that, if it came to it, she would let a big bank fail \u2014 and it would not be surprising if other presidential candidates adopted her anti-bailout stance.But regulations introduced since the financial crisis of 2008 have, in theory, already made it much safer to let a bank die. And on Friday, the Federal Reserve proposed a new rule that aims to make the process of winding down a faltering financial giant smoother still.It would require banks to have a bigger financial buffer that could absorb potential losses on loans and trading positions.The new regulation seeks to inflict the costs of a failure on investors who have lent to an ailing bank and on its shareholders, rather than on taxpayers. The hope is that the rule would work without greatly disrupting the wider market and economy.\u201cThe proposal is another important step in addressing the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem,\u201d said Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, referring to the notion that the government has to bail out big banks because letting them fail would cause severe collateral damage in the economy.Of course, there can be no guarantee that the authorities would let a large financial firm topple in a future crisis, especially if several big banks are teetering at once. In 2008, soon after Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial system seized up, government officials dropped their opposition to bailouts.At the very least, though, the new rule and related regulations could force investors to think harder about the risks of backing financial giants. And if large banks have to consistently pay more for their financing, they may decide to shrink to make their businesses more profitable.\u201cThe proposal should also improve market discipline,\u201d Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who has spearheaded several new banking rules, said in a statement.The banking industry, perhaps wanting to avoid harsher measures, has mostly embraced the system of winding down large banks that was set up under the Dodd-Frank Act, which Congress passed in 2010 to overhaul the United States\u2019 shaky financial system.Still, the Fed\u2019s new rule, which focuses on the country\u2019s eight largest banks, like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, could increase costs for an industry that has already borne the burden of hundreds of new regulations. The Fed estimated that the eight banks would currently need $120 billion combined to meet the requirements of the new rule. The banks may not need to issue large sums of additional debt and equity to make up that shortfall. Even so, the Fed estimated that the banks\u2019 combined cost of financing themselves could increase by as much as $1.5 billion a year. The banks and others, including the public, can now submit comments on the rule.The Fed\u2019s rule stems from an international effort to expand financial buffers at giant banks to help protect them against losses. The official name for the buffer is total loss-absorbing capacity. Most of the buffer takes the form of shareholders\u2019 equity, the part of a bank\u2019s financing that does not need to be paid back. The new rule stipulates that the buffer must also include a certain amount of long-term debt that the banks have issued to investors.A bank\u2019s borrowings are not usually seen as a stable form of capital because the money has to be repaid, and thus may not be around to absorb losses if the bank\u2019s creditors flee. But the new rule says that the debt must be long-term in nature, which means the creditors cannot demand immediate repayment.When a bank crashes and is seized by regulators, its equity often gets wiped out by losses. The innovation under the new rule is that the long-term debt in the buffer would absorb any losses left after the equity is gone. And, crucially, the debt would be turned into new equity that would provide the financial foundation for the new bank that emerges from receivership.By making it clear upfront who will bear a failing bank\u2019s losses, the Fed hopes to dispel much of the chaos and panic that can occur when a large financial firm is foundering. Mr. Tarullo said that the rule could reduce the risk that other creditors will flee the bank.The eight banks \u2014 which also include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2014 have time to raise new debt. Broadly speaking, at the start of 2019, a bank\u2019s loss-absorbing buffer would have to be equivalent to at least 16 percent of its assets. The percentage increases to 18 percent by the start of 2022, when the rule takes full effect.But some banks will most likely end up with higher buffers. Under certain assumptions, which could change if the banks shrink or grow, JPMorgan\u2019s buffer, for example, could reach 23.5 percent of its assets, according to figures released on Friday by the Fed. The buffer for Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in this analysis was 20.5 percent.The big question is whether that buffer would be sufficient in a crisis. On paper, the buffers would have amply absorbed the level of losses sustained by banks in the last crisis and the subsequent recession. But the Fed noted that losses might have been higher in the last crisis had the government not shored up the system \u2014 and there may be less assistance in the next bust. Right now, six of these eight banks have shortfalls under the new rule. Fed officials declined to say which banks those were. Analysts added that it was hard to identify which banks already complied because it was not clear how much of a bank\u2019s current long-term debt would qualify for inclusion in the buffer.Still, some banks may need to raise more new long-term debt than others. Wells Fargo, for instance, may need to issue long-term debt to replace financing it gets from other sources like deposits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reopening the Bank of Mom and Dad, to Help Adult Children", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringCutting the financial cord with adult children can be hard to do.Just ask Virginia Illiano, a substitute teacher who lives in Brooklyn. After her daughter graduated from an expensive private college, Ms. Illiano thought her days of paying big bills for her daughter were over.She was wrong. Her daughter, who is in her 20s, was not able to find a good-paying job and ended up moving in with her mother. That was just the beginning. Ms. Illiano co-signed for a leased car, repaid some of her daughter\u2019s credit card debt and even paid for her nails, vacations and some clothes.\u201cMy teacher benefits are awesome, but she won\u2019t have any of that,\u201d said Ms. Illiano, 55, who is divorced. And that\u2019s just fine with Ms. Illiano.\u201cI told my daughter to go for her dream,\u201d she said, explaining that she wanted her \u201cto have her financial legs.\u201dMore older parents are facing challenges like Ms. Illiano\u2019s. They are helping their adult children by dishing out loans or cash gifts, or paying bills. But this largess sometimes blows a big hole in their finances, even jeopardizing their retirement. As a result, some older adults are going back to work, reducing their own living expenses or even declaring bankruptcy.While rigorous data is difficult to obtain, several reports suggest that the problems associated with supporting adult children are growing. At the same time, many baby boomers are far short of holding enough in their retirement accounts to support themselves into old age.\u201cSome adult children aren\u2019t making enough money,\u201d said Netiva Heard, a certified debt counselor at MNH Credit Solutions in Chicago. \u201cSo parents are taking over certain bills like credit cards, cellphones and rent.\u201dParents, of course, want the best for their children from the moment they are born and are used to doing everything they can to help them. Continuing that support into adulthood has spread, experts say, largely because the economy of the last decade has fallen short in generating good job opportunities for their millennial children.\u201cBut the last thing you want is for your kids to end up taking care of you financially,\u201d Ms. Heard said. \u201cAnd, anyway, kids can learn from their own money struggles.\u201dBaby boomers face increasing retirement challenges of their own as traditional defined benefit pensions have been widely replaced by riskier 401(k) plans and the like, which require disciplined savings. Many have not done the comprehensive financial planning needed to factor in the greater chance that they will live longer, or accumulated enough in savings and investments to cover future health expenses.There are clear warning signs, experts said, that parents may be giving their adult children too much money. These include taking loans from 401(k) accounts, failing to make full retirement account contributions or draining savings.Take Jacquelyn McClellan, 74, who lives in Orange City, Fla. In what admittedly is an extreme case, Ms. McClellan, a retired program analyst for the federal government, began paying for various expenses for her grandchildren after her son said he could not afford them. She paid for dancing school, parochial school, trips to Disneyland, all with the help of money from her pension.These payments ended up tipping Ms. McClellan into bankruptcy in 2011. Since then, Ms. McClellan has sharply dialed back her own lifestyle. She can\u2019t go on vacation cruises and has only minimal savings.Still, Ms. McClellan felt a sense of duty to help out her grandchildren. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to have a bad life,\u201d she said, adding that they are now flourishing.Giving some financial help can be a much-needed balm for family members. The problem is, many parents approaching or already in retirement do not know where they stand financially and how much they can afford to give without undermining their own security.Giving gifts of money to chronically needy adult children can become expensive very quickly.Supporting more extravagant expenses like a fancy car or country club memberships should be cut off altogether, Mr. Schaefer recommended.One-time loans, or gifts, that are used to pay for unexpected emergencies like medical expenses require little thought for parents who can afford them.But going back to the money trough time and time again is dangerous. \u201cLook at kids and ask, \u2018What is the money for?\u2019\u201d said Robert J. Semrad in Chicago, the senior partner at DebtStoppers, a bankruptcy law firm. \u201cIs this a solution to the problem or just a Band-Aid? Many times money given as a Band-Aid merely delays the inevitable.\u201dAvoid co-signing loans for cars or homes, Mr. Semrad said, since a parent\u2019s own credit can be jeopardized. \u201cBanks can go after co-signers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd having assets makes you more susceptible.\u201dProperly drafted loans by parents to their children can teach the children valuable financial lessons, though. The keys, experts said, are to give the loans set terms and to establish a regular repayment schedule.Peter Lazaroff, a financial adviser at Plancorp in Missouri, recommends loans that include interest rates. The loan then works just like a bond, he added, and the parent gets back principal and interest. The child should also sign a contract, which can be drafted by a lawyer. A loan that is not paid back can be deducted from an inheritance.Kathleen Gurney, who runs the Financial Psychology Corporation in Florida, encouraged parents to structure a loan as if a son or daughter were a business partner. The contract should include loan terms, length and consequences for nonpayment.\u201cLoaning money works well,\u201d she said, \u201cif the process is objective and well planned.\u201dMs. Gurney has seen many cases in which older parents helped their adult children, only to end up in dire financial straits themselves. One couple she counseled had to return to work part time in a restaurant because they had decided to support their divorced son\u2019s wife and children.\u201cThese financial decisions can affect your health and marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd some people even slip into depression because they must continue to work.\u201dExperts also caution against giving a loan to an adult child who clearly cannot repay it. Family loans, they point out, are common, but being paid back is less so.Instead of cash, parents can offer their children networking help in looking for a job and provide other forms of support. But when gifts or loans are involved, the most important thing is to be honest with yourself \u2014 and your children.\u201cTough love,\u201d said Mr. Hopkins at the American College, \u201crequires parents to plan what they give their children. So you must have a process in place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sounds of War Recede to Background in an Eastern Ukraine City", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMariupol Journal10 Photos\u201cThese days, the war is happening on a kind of political chessboard,\u201d said Mr. Sovyak, a metallurgist. \u201cIt has become a conflict in the mind. In reality, in everyday life, there is no war anymore.\u201d\u201cDespite the fact the city is pretty much surrounded, life goes on, the city works,\u201d said Tatiana Lomakina, vice mayor in charge of refugee issues. \u201cThe main plants all function. The seaport is open. Schools are operating. Cultural and social life continues.\u201d\u201cYes, it is true, one can become used to war,\u201d said Sergei Fillipov, vice commander of the volunteer Donbas Battalion, which like other volunteer militias has been removed from front-line duty in recent months, replaced by fresh Ukrainian regulars. \u201cIt is how it goes.\u201dFears that Russian-backed troops would come swarming over the eastern horizon have all but vanished. Now, if anything, there is widespread doubt here and in Kiev, the capital, that the separatists have anywhere near the numbers needed for such an attack.\u201cThere are many fewer Russian troops in the separatist zone than during the heavy fighting early this year,\u201d said Yaroslav Chepurniy, a spokesman for Ukrainian military forces in the conflict area. \u201cAnd, according to our intelligence, even fewer of them are regular Russian troops. They are mostly mercenaries.\u201dSo the war has devolved into a low-level skirmish of nightly shelling on the city\u2019s edges, barely affecting daily life. Shops are open and full of goods. Parks and beaches are crowded on warm days. Reservations at the best seaside restaurants can be difficult on the weekend.\u201cThere was a panic a year ago, because there was a real threat,\u201d said Andrei Fedoy, the secretary of the City Council and a lifelong Mariupol resident. \u201cA lot of people left the city. Now, people have calmed down and a lot of them have come back. People are just tired of being afraid.\u201dMariupol, founded in 1778 on the site of an old Cossack encampment and settled initially by Greek refugees, grew into an industrial powerhouse during the decades it was part of the Soviet Union, built on steel and metallurgy.When the separatists seized much of the surrounding Donbas region, including the provincial capital of Donetsk, Mariupol was named the temporary capital. In May of last year, the city was briefly seized by the separatists, and then retaken in June.A fresh assault in August came within 10 miles of the city limits and another fierce round of fighting in January and February rattled residents\u2019 nerves and seemed to presage an attack that never came. Many predicted a new summer offensive.Instead, despite a brief increase in shelling attacks in August, the conflict held at a low simmer, officials said. So, hobbled by the stubborn conflict and Ukraine\u2019s flailing economy, Mariupol stumbles along on the strength of its industry, its port, its debris-flecked beaches, and its population of a half-million has been bolstered by tens of thousands of the war\u2019s refugees.Modern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.\u201cIt is a natural psychological reaction to block out the war after a while,\u201d said Maxim Borodin, 38, who runs a local advocacy group on anticorruption and environmental issues. \u201cThere are people who say we should shut all the bars and cafes, to force people to focus on the war. But people can\u2019t think about war all the time.\u201dUntil this summer, so-called volunteer battalions that cooperated with the Ukrainian military took many front-line positions around Mariupol. But then, to the surprise of the battalion leaders and many residents, the volunteer groups like the right-wing Azov Battalion and the religion-inspired St. Mary\u2019s Battalion were pulled back and replaced by Ukrainian regulars.\u201cThis is as close as we get now to the front lines,\u201d Andrei Zorka, acting spokesman for the Azov volunteers, said sadly from their shabby compound not far from the city center. \u201cWe came here to fight, to protect this land. But it is a very strange and scary thing. People seem to have gotten used to hearing the shelling. They don\u2019t even pay attention to it anymore.\u201dIn the small storefront that acts as Mariupol headquarters for Right Sector, another right-wing group of volunteers, Serhiy Chiryn, the regional political officer, picked at a plate of sugar cookies and sipped steaming tea from a dainty, flowered cup. Like many in Mariupol, he tries to read the mind of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.\u201cI think the conflict will be frozen this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine has become just one little card in a new geopolitical game Putin is playing that includes Syria, Iran and China.\u201dOfficials and many local residents believe the region is slowly moving toward a situation similar to Transnistria in Moldova or Ossetia in Georgia, where Russian-leaning enclaves operate independently from the central government.\u201cIt seems to us to be the best decision,\u201d said Mr. Chepurniy, the military spokesman. \u201cIf we are going to liberate the whole area taken by the separatists, we know we will face regular Russian Army forces and we are not ready for them.\u201dEven on the city\u2019s outskirts, where the shelling is a more immediate danger, a kind of normalcy prevails.\u201cYou go out now to these areas and you still see people growing potatoes, sending their children to school,\u201d Mr. Chepurniy said. \u201cThere is no panic anymore. There is no chaos.\u201dBut there is still a persistent tension.\u201cFor now, life goes on and there is enough to sell in the shops,\u201d said Galina Dodysheva, 52, who runs a small grocery in the suburban village of Talakovka, just a few miles from the separatist front lines. \u201cBut we are still nervous. There is shelling almost every day somewhere nearby.\u201dOleksandr, a Ukrainian sentry at the checkpoint on the village\u2019s eastern edge, who declined to give his last name, wiped the sleep from his eyes after a brief afternoon nap and kicked the mud from his rubber spa sandals.\u201cIt is like they have a schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shelling begins at 9 p.m. and lasts about an hour.\u201d Some nights there are a handful of shells, other nights a bit more. But he is not worried.\u201cHere, in fact, we are not at war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just waiting for the politicians to negotiate a solution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Struggling Economy Finds \u2018Abenomics\u2019 Is Not an Easy Fix", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s economy has contracted so many times in the last few years that the meaning of recession has started to blur. If an economy is shrinking almost as often as it is growing, what does any single downturn say about its health?Now Japan appears to be faltering again.\u201cThe potential growth rate is close to zero, so any small shock can put the economy into recession,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, the chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cGrowth expectations are anemic.\u201dAs a result, some economists are betting that the Bank of Japan, which has been pumping vast amounts of money into the economy by buying up government debt, will pull the trigger on more stimulus at its next board meeting on Friday.The central bank\u2019s aggressive intervention has been central to Mr. Abe\u2019s policies, widely known as Abenomics. But events have conspired to blunt its impact.Last year, it was an ill-timed sales tax increase, which rattled Japanese consumers and dissuaded them from spending. Lately it has been the deceleration in China, whose factories have been important buyers of Japanese-made machinery.But the more fundamental problem, many specialists say, is that Japan\u2019s economy simply doesn\u2019t grow much in the first place.Baseline growth is essentially zero. Gross domestic product is the same size it was in the mid-1990s, in part because the work force is shrinking. So where a faster-moving economy might simply lose momentum in response to headwinds, Japan\u2019s goes into reverse.So far, Mr. Abe\u2019s policies have done little to change the dynamic.\u201cOverseas investors appear increasingly disillusioned with Abenomics,\u201d Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, said last week after a series of meetings with clients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in Asia.Foreign investors\u2019 enthusiasm for Abenomics was a central force in driving up Japanese stock prices, one of the few clear-cut successes of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic program. Although the rally has lost steam in the last few months along with other global markets, the Nikkei 225 is still about twice the level it was when Mr. Abe took office at the end of 2012.Other parts of the economy look weaker. One of Abenomics\u2019 central objectives, to generate a strong and sustained rise in consumer prices, \u201cremains very elusive,\u201d Mr. Baba said, as do its goals of raising workers\u2019 incomes and dismantling regulatory hurdles to business.Taken together, improvements in these areas were supposed to bolster the economy\u2019s metabolism and increase its underlying potential to grow.But the Fed has cut back its bond-buying program in response to a recovering American economy, and it is now considering whether to raise its benchmark interest rate from close to zero. A move by the Japanese central bank would go in the opposite direction \u2014 toward even looser monetary policy.The Bank of Japan\u2019s meeting this week will coincide with a twice-yearly update of board members\u2019 forecasts for growth and inflation, which are likely to show increased pessimism. Mr. Kuroda timed his last blast of stimulus with the same October review last year, catching the markets by surprise. Stocks in Japan and around the world jumped.Mr. Kuroda has been doing his best to lower expectations, insisting that the bank\u2019s current monetary settings are sufficient. Inflation has been held back by falling oil prices, he says, but the underlying direction of prices and wages is upward.\u201cI think the current policy, so-called qualitative and quantitative easing, has been working, having the intended impact on the economy,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC on Oct. 11, at a meeting of global central bankers in Lima.Mr. Kuroda misdirected markets with similar talk before his unexpected move last year. But he may face greater constraints to action this time around. Stimulus measures by the central bank tend to drag down the value of the yen. That is good for multinational companies that earn revenue abroad, but it risks angering Japan\u2019s trading partners, as well as Japanese consumers and small businesses, whose buying power declines with the currency.This month, Japan and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, including the United States, reached a hard-won agreement on a sprawling trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Abe says the increased trade and investment flows it promises to generate are crucial to raising Japan\u2019s long-run growth rate. But the pact is subject to approval by each country\u2019s legislature, including the United States Congress, where some members have accused Japan of unfairly suppressing the value of the yen to gain a competitive advantage.\u201cForeign exchange policy is very tricky with T.P.P. in the balance,\u201d said Mr. Adachi of JPMorgan, who used to work at the Japanese central bank and understands the political sensitivities that can shape its nominally independent decisions. \u201cOrdinary households don\u2019t want to see a weaker yen, either,\u201d he added, noting that the government faces an election for the upper house of Parliament next year.Mr. Abe\u2019s economic team, normally a cheerleader for bolder central bank action, has also been unusually circumspect. \u201cThe Bank of Japan may not ease policy further any time soon,\u201d Finance Minister Taro Aso said in a recent interview with the public broadcaster NHK.Mr. Abe has continued to make ambitious promises. Last month, he set a goal of increasing Japan\u2019s nominal economic output to 600 trillion yen by 2020 or soon after \u2014 an increase of about 20 percent from the current level. He gave little indication of how an economy that has not grown in two decades could expand by a fifth in just a few years.Audacious pronouncements have been a hallmark of Abenomics from the start \u2014 part of what Mr. Kuroda has described as an effort to dispel Japan\u2019s \u201cdeflationary mind-set.\u201d But after three mostly lackluster years, its architects\u2019 credibility is being questioned by many, including their natural supporters in the business elite.\u201cI believe \u00a5600 trillion is an outrageous figure,\u201d Yoshimitsu Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said after Mr. Abe announced his goal. \u201cI see it as merely a political message.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ben Bernanke\u2019s \u2018The Courage to Act\u2019", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The memoirs of Ben S. Bernanke, who succeeded Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve, are essential reading for anyone who wants to know exactly what happened at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of Aug. 5, 2008. Or at each of the many other Federal Open Market Committee meetings from 2006 to 2014, Bernanke\u2019s years as chairman.Yes, the book is a bit of a slog, but it is undoubtedly the best account we will ever have of how government and financial institutions dealt with what has come to be known as the Great Recession. It\u2019s an odd term, isn\u2019t it? It invokes comparisons to the Great Depression and simultaneously suggests that: \u201cShucks, it wasn\u2019t all that great. Wasn\u2019t a depression or anything.\u201d But Bernanke is persuasive in arguing that (a) it was pretty damned great (i.e., terrible) and (b) he and his colleagues at the Fed deserve credit for the fact that it wasn\u2019t a heck of a lot greater.Bernanke, formerly a Princeton economics professor, also asks for and deserves credit for his pet cause of more openness \u2014 or, as we say now, \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 at the notoriously secretive Federal Reserve. Alan Greenspan liked to cultivate an air of mystery. By the time Bernanke stepped down, the Fed chairman was holding four news conferences a year. The breathlessness with which Bernanke describes this development \u2014 four news conferences a year! \u2014 unintentionally proves his point.As Bernanke himself tells the tale, he perhaps came to enjoy wearing the crown overmuch. There are a few too many sentences like, \u201cAfterward, my security team and I dropped Larry Summers off at his hotel.\u201d At the same time, there are far too few sen\u00adtences containing the words \u201cLarry Summers,\u201d which are generally a guarantee of interesting controversy.If you can\u2019t already tell the players without a program, Bernanke makes you read between the lines to suspect that he doesn\u2019t much like, for example, Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the F.D.I.C. \u201cShe could be turf-conscious and hard to work with,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I also couldn\u2019t help but grudgingly admire her energy, her political acumen in pursuing her goals and her skill in playing to the press.\u201dNow that he has a memoir to peddle, Bernanke may regret his apparent \u2014 and apparently sincere \u2014 policy of having a nice word for everybody. For example, he has belatedly changed his mind about whether misbehaving bankers should have gone to jail; in recent interviews he\u2019s said he\u2019s for it, though there\u2019s not much evidence of that in the book. And when Bernanke decided to resign (\u201cMore than a decade in the Washington pressure cooker was enough\u201d), President Obama asked his advice on a replacement. Bernanke writes: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to influence his choice too much, since my support for any one candidate could easily be misrepresented as opposition to another.\u201d Since there is only one Fed chairman (or chairwoman), support for one candidate does, tragically, imply opposition not just to one but to all the others. No misrepresentation required. Bernanke never does tip his hand about who he thought should succeed him, but you get the feeling his candidate was not Summers.The time and energy Fed policy makers spend worrying about the board\u2019s image and attempting to affect how its actions are interpreted does at first seem excessive compared with, for example, that of the Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court\u2019s work product is legal opinions, which are supposed to be tightly reasoned and to speak for themselves. Fed pronouncements, by contrast, are purposely \u2014 and to some extent necessarily \u2014 ambiguous. If the financial markets knew in advance precisely what the Fed intended to do (drive interest rates up, but not so far that you drive the economy back into recession; lower interest rates but not enough to spark inflation; etc.), doing it would be harder. Even a transparency enthusiast like Bernanke did not want to spill all the beans.Bernanke finds it ironic that Greenspan called his own memoir of his Fed years \u201cThe Age of Turbulence.\u201d Bernanke doesn\u2019t spell it out, or need to: \u201cYou wanna see turbulence, buddy? I\u2019ll show you turbulence.\u201d Bernanke\u2019s memoir is called \u201cThe Courage to Act\u201d \u2014 a title that might also be labeled ironic because, although he generally chose to act in most of the crises he faced, it would have required an equal amount of courage, or even more, not to.By law, as Bernanke explains repeatedly (with a slightly exasperated tone), the Fed has what\u2019s called a \u201cdual mandate\u201d: to protect jobs and also to protect the stability of the currency. Or, in other words, to maximize employment and minimize inflation. These goals are inherently contradictory, and the Fed has only a limited number of dials it can fiddle with to achieve the best possible combined result. Critics are always complaining that the Fed is favoring one of these goals over the other, or that it is going about one or the other goal the wrong way. The heart of \u201cThe Courage to Act\u201d is a detailed but very lucid step-by-step explanation of each crisis Bernanke and the Fed faced during his tenure, from the collapse of Bear Stearns in 2008 to the continuing trauma over Greece and the euro that is still going on. In each case Bernanke lays out the problem and how it came about, discusses the pros and cons of various solutions, then tells us how it all was resolved \u2014 generally with a compromise, which Bernanke supports because he understands and appreciates the concerns of both sides. This is an excellent approach for a Fed chairman, but somewhat less desirable in a memoirist.The various crises usually boil down to similar story lines. Some institution or piece of the economy \u2014 big investment banks, the housing sector, the insurance company A.I.G., the auto manufacturers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the two giant \u00adgovernment-chartered mortgage agencies) and so on \u2014 was in trouble. If the government stood by and did nothing, the result would be catastrophic not just for those directly involved but for the entire economy. However, to save people from their own mistakes creates \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2014 meaning the risk of encouraging more of the undesirable behavior that caused the problem in the first place. If you bail out one reckless homeowner or one too-big-to-fail investment bank, what justification will you have not to bail out all of them? And what if they all conclude they can continue to pursue their reckless ways and the government will rescue them if necessary?Bernanke makes a compelling case that in 2007 and 2008, the world economy came very close to collapse, and only novel efforts by the Fed (cooperating with other United States and foreign government agencies) saved us from an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression. Although he agreed with concerns about moral hazard, he concluded that in this particular case, too much was at stake to worry about it. He never really offers a theory or guidepost for deciding when traditional concerns like moral hazard should be put aside.During precisely the months in which all this was going on, we were conducting a presidential election campaign in which the looming catastrophe played almost no role. John McCain, the Republican candidate, was made to look like a fool for canceling appearances and rushing back to Washington at the height of the campaign, and finding nothing to do when he got there. Only long after the election did Congress take up the redesign of financial regulations for which the crisis had demonstrated a clear need.The Federal Reserve system is hard to justify in democratic terms. Except for a few cranks and obsessives, almost nobody can even explain how it works, let alone develop an informed opinion about the policies that emerge from it. Ben Bernanke fought for more openness at the Fed. It was a worthy fight and he won. But what good is transparency if almost everybody is looking the other way?THE COURAGE TO ACTA Memoir of a Crisis and Its AftermathBy Ben S. BernankeIllustrated. 610 pp. W.W.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Revenue Up Sharply, Bolstered by Mobile Sales", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven Alibaba\u2019s dominance in online shopping, investors have been concerned that the trouble in the country\u2019s economy could spill over into the company\u2019s performance.After its much-hyped initial public offering last year, Alibaba reported lackluster earnings in the first half of 2015. Its stock price even briefly dropped below its listing price.Now Alibaba is showing signs of stabilizing.In its results on Tuesday, Alibaba reported that sales rose 32 percent in the latest quarter to 22.2 billion renminbi, or $3.5 billion. Earnings per share increased 30 percent. After Alibaba reported results on Tuesday, the company\u2019s stock jumped 5 percent in morning trading.Still, analysts continue to worry about how a general slowdown in China could rattle Alibaba. Slower growth is expected to hit the wallets of the Chinese middle class, who regularly splurge on the company\u2019s online shopping platforms. At around $79, Alibaba\u2019s shares are still a long way from the $119 high-water mark they hit after the I.P.O.\u201cEconomic challenges most likely weighed on average spending by buyers,\u201d the research group Trefis wrote in a report.Speaking to concerns about the Chinese economy, Joe Tsai, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, said in a conference call on Tuesday that the company did not believe that a blip in Chinese growth would have a long-term impact on the consumer spending on Alibaba\u2019s sites.\u201cWhen you look at the Chinese consumer, they\u2019re very liquid. They have lots of cash deposits in their account,\u201d he said, adding \u201ca temporary setback in the macro economy is not going to affect their consumption pattern in a fundamental way.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Tsai noted that Chinese consumption as a percentage of the country\u2019s output is still well below that of developed countries. He expected consumption to naturally become a larger part of China\u2019s economic growth. It is a shift that officials in Beijing are similarly pushing.Like many Internet players, Alibaba is looking to mobile as it charts out opportunities.The company\u2019s revenue from mobile advertising, traditionally less than is made on online desktop ads, almost tripled from a year earlier, to $1.7 billion. Alibaba said on Tuesday that mobile phones also account for about 62 percent of the total transactions on its e-commerce sites.In the conference call, Alibaba executives emphasized new revenue streams that could eventually contribute to the company, including takeout and grocery delivery, a cloud computing unit that serves small businesses, and outreach to rural users.\u201cConsumption isn\u2019t just about online shopping, but consumption of digital goods; it\u2019s about consumption of services. We are looking at things that will enhance our position in the consumption economy,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Grand Bargain, but Deal Is Still a Victory for Obama", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisFor this fiscal year alone, the deal would add $50 billion in spending, divided equally between defense and domestic programs, as well as $16 billion for emergency war spending, half for the military, half for the State Department. Together, that represents an increase of $66 billion above the spending limits for 2016, not far off the $70 billion increase Mr. Obama requested.From the moment he introduced his budget Feb. 2, Mr. Obama held firm on his demand that Congress break through the punishing across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in the Budget Control Act to provide equal increases to domestic and military spending. He promised to veto any spending bill that adhered to the statutory spending caps, made good on that threat this month by vetoing a popular defense policy bill, enlisted the support of congressional Democrats with whom his White House had sometimes sparred on budget matters, and capitalized on Republican divisions to get his way.Senate Democrats created an impenetrable wall for Republicans determined to stick to the caps, filibustering the spending bills that reached the Senate floor and threatening to block the ones that did not. House Democrats stayed in lock step with Mr. Obama as well, with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, promising that her troops would sustain the president\u2019s veto.\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for some overarching grand bargain, but there\u2019s a lot in here the White House likes and not much they don\u2019t,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. \u201cMost importantly, if the deal prevails, they won\u2019t have to deal with budget nonsense for the rest of the term, which has got to look pretty sweet.\u201dHis opposition seemed orchestrated more to keep his election as speaker on track than to derail a budget deal that mirrors one he personally negotiated with Senate Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, in 2013.The president, hammered by some in his party for staying on the sidelines in earlier budget battles, deployed Katie Beirne Fallon and Brian Deese, senior officials with deep knowledge of Capitol Hill and the budget, to hammer out details with aides to Mr. Boehner; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader; and Ms. Pelosi.\u201cThe Boehner resignation clearly was a pivot point, and his clear statement of wanting to clean out the barn was a real signal to the administration that there was a chance here,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, a former senior Republican Senate budget aide. \u201cThe president learned a lot from his previous experiences on this, that if you\u2019re trying to govern, you don\u2019t run a political campaign. You have to work quietly and hard behind the scenes.\u201dMr. Obama, who disdains such legislative wrangling, ultimately had to yield to it.The White House said Mr. Obama had been \u201cheavily engaged\u201d in the talks behind the scenes since mid-September \u2014 a change from two years ago, when he sat on the sideline as Mr. Ryan and Ms. Murray negotiated the last increase in the spending limits. What Mr. Obama got in return was an agreement that White House officials said would create jobs and promote growth \u2014 and that Democrats hope will position them for electoral success in 2016.Whether or not that happens, Mr. Obama can now see the end of lurching from spending crisis to spending crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that he\u2019d like to do for the rest of his term, and that doesn\u2019t include worrying about shutdowns and debt ceilings and spending hours strategizing and squabbling like crazy with the other side,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cThe idea that he can now work on policy he wants to promote, particularly around the economy, education, infrastructure \u2014 that\u2019s got to feel great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Mergers Damage the Economy", "Date": "2015-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn many industries, like airlines, telecommunications, health care and beer, mergers and acquisitions have increased the market power of big corporations in the last several decades. That has hurt consumers and is probably exacerbating income inequality, new research shows.These trends ought to concern everybody, particularly lawmakers in Congress and officials at the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies that review mergers. It is increasingly clear that officials have allowed too many mergers. This has especially been true of Republican administrations and conservative judges who bought into the dubious notion that consolidation leads to great efficiency and that the free market will fix any problems.The Obama administration has not been wedded to free-market dogma, but it has also waved through some big mergers. Officials approved two big airlines mergers \u2014 United and Continental, and American and US Airways. Just four national airlines now carry the vast majority of domestic passenger traffic, down from six when Mr. Obama came into office. The big carriers control so many gates and takeoff and landing slots at their hub airports that other airlines can\u2019t mount a real challenge.Congress should also study whether there are ways to strengthen the antitrust laws. It could, for instance, require regulators to consider whether mergers in concentrated industries are in the broader public interest, not just whether they would harm consumers through higher prices. The F.C.C. can already use such a test to evaluate media and telecom deals to determine, for example, whether a merger will limit the diversity of opinions in media. Unfortunately, Congress is unlikely to adopt new antitrust legislation while Republicans are in control of both houses.Markets work best when there is healthy competition among businesses. In too many industries, that competition just doesn\u2019t exist anymore.Correction: November 1, 2015An earlier version of this editorial misattributed a statement about the proposed deal between Walgreens and Rite Aid. It was industry analysts, not Walgreens, who said the merger could allow Walgreens to demand better terms from drug makers and pharmacy benefit managers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Link Between Parenting and Leadership", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLife@WorkLast Sunday morning, my 18-month-old grandson, Jonah, was scheduled to be the ring bearer at his aunt\u2019s wedding. It was a tall order for a toddler to walk down the aisle carrying a ring successfully, especially since the ceremony was scheduled to start an hour later than Jonah\u2019s usual morning nap. I could see him beginning to fray.When the wedding procession began, Jonah was in it, but coming down the aisle, he was in the arms of his father, Phil, and alongside his mother, Kate. Jonah is a buoyant, joyful and social child, but the combination of fatigue and a large crowd challenged his limited resources.Two thoughts occurred to me. One was how vulnerable and hungry for security and reassurance a child can feel in any moment. The other was that Jonah found it on this occasion in his father\u2019s arms.The scene also made me think about one of Paul Ryan\u2019s nonnegotiable demands as Republicans were recruiting him to be speaker of the House. \u201cI cannot and will not give up my family,\u201d he said, referring to his wife and three children, ages 13, 11 and 10. As a congressman, Mr. Ryan regularly travels home to Wisconsin for three-day weekends. \u201cIt\u2019s his oxygen to be here with his family,\u201d his wife, Janna, said.Mr. Ryan\u2019s demands were met, and he was elected speaker of the House this week. I have no idea how much time he spends with his children, but I deeply believe \u2013 and a growing body of research confirms \u2014 that the more time and attention children get from their parents, the better off they will be in life.Mr. Ryan negotiated well for himself and his family, but unfortunately, not for the rest of us.The powerful new speaker does not support legislation that could make it easier for working parents to take better care of their children. The best example is the Family and Medical Insurance Leave bill, which would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for employees to care for newborn children or address serious medical issues in the family. Mr. Ryan is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has yet to take up the measure.What\u2019s the incentive for companies to step in where our government is falling so woefully short?The argument on society\u2019s behalf is clear and common sense. For better or worse, our children (and grandchildren) are our future. Thanks to the work of researchers such as John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, we know a great deal about how critical it is for each of us to build a basic level of trust and secure attachment with our primary caregivers early in our lives.The more reliably children receive love, comfort, support and soothing from their primary caregivers\u2013 still most commonly their mothers \u2014 the more secure, healthy and effective they become in their lives.My grandson Jonah receives an extraordinary amount of love and attention from his four grandparents, who live nearby, and it visibly fills him with delight. Still, when it comes to comfort and reassurance if he is upset, Jonah will almost invariably turn to his mother or father.This is where the intersection between work and family life begins to get more interesting. On the one hand, research suggests that working parents who get paid leave when their children are born tend to build better bonds with them over time. Not surprisingly, children also fare better in life when they grow up with two involved parents.In homes in which fathers work long hours and take on limited family responsibilities, that becomes the norm for their sons. Indeed, most women still take on the primary responsibility for raising their children. As Robin J. Ely of Harvard Business School has found, many men often feel compelled to sacrifice their families to advance their careers, while many women feel compelled to give up or cut back their careers to take care of their children.Companies suffer from the poor parental choices made by both genders.Men, who are neither permitted nor encouraged to take parental leave, end up deprived of the early level of bonding that could help them become better fathers by building more capacity for caregiving, empathy, vulnerability, attunement and emotional connection.Coincidentally, these are increasingly critical qualities for leaders operating in a highly networked global economy. It is scarcely a surprise that women, who are encouraged to nurture those qualities from early in their lives, are consistently rated by their employees as better leaders than men.I\u2019m convinced that it will make Emily and Omri \u2013 and anyone else given that opportunity \u2014 better at both.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of the writer\u2019s grandson, Jonah. He is 18 months old, not 19 months old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Banker Sees His Role in Cyprus as a Chance to Give Back", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 The Swiss banker Josef Ackermann played a role in the events that nearly destroyed the Cyprus banking system in 2013. Now he was back in this sleepy capital, toiling to fix one of the very banks he helped undermine.Redemption, said Mr. Ackermann, the former Deutsche Bank chief, would be too strong a word to describe why he, once one of the most powerful bankers in the world, agreed to be chairman of the Bank of Cyprus \u2014 the Mediterranean island\u2019s largest lender, but puny in global terms.In his office at bank headquarters in Nicosia \u2014 which is comfortable but not nearly as grand as his office was at Deutsche Bank \u2014 Mr. Ackermann said, \u201cIf I could give something back to the people or society, I would like to do that.\u201d He receives what, by investment banking standards, is token compensation of 68,000 euros per year. He said he had no options or other ways to profit from the bank\u2019s recovery, if it happened.But the bank and the island\u2019s economy are so closely intertwined that if Mr. Ackermann, 67, helps revive the bank, he will also help revive the country, whose problems were briefly at the epicenter of global financial market anxiety in 2013. And Mr. Ackermann would perhaps enhance his own legacy, which has lost some of its sheen since he left Deutsche Bank in 2012.At Deutsche Bank, Mr. Ackermann led the institution to the top echelons of investment banking. But it has since struggled to maintain that status as regulators have pressed banks to reduce risk. His successor, Anshu Jain, has already resigned under pressure.Subsequently, Mr. Ackermann was a part-time chairman of Zurich Insurance, a position that ended badly after its chief financial officer committed suicide, leaving behind a note that blamed Mr. Ackermann for his despair. An investigation by Swiss regulators absolved Mr. Ackermann of blame, but he resigned and has kept a low profile since.Mr. Ackermann says he does not have a bad conscience. \u201cBy no means,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we did a lot of good things.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cI want to demonstrate that we cannot only make money for ourselves, but also that banking is actually something which is a main contributor to the prosperity of society at large.\u201dThough Bank of Cyprus is the largest lender on the island by far, its 25 billion euros, or about $28 billion, in assets would be a rounding error at Deutsche Bank, which has more than a trillion euros in assets. If the Bank of Cyprus were in the United States, it would be a midsize regional bank, slightly smaller than the Bank of Oklahoma.In addition to Mr. Ackermann, the Bank of Cyprus has attracted a surprising number of financial industry heavyweights to the island, which has a population of about 1.2 million and is geographically closer to the Middle East than to Europe.Its main investors include Wilbur L. Ross Jr., an American billionaire who specializes in buying distressed assets, and who late last year persuaded Mr. Ackermann to oversee Bank of Cyprus. The Renova Group, a Russian conglomerate controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful businessmen, is the bank\u2019s largest foreign shareholder, with a 6.2 percent stake. Mr. Ackermann also has connections to Renova; he is a member of the board of a unit that controls the company\u2019s holdings outside Russia.John Hourican, the chief executive of Bank of Cyprus since 2013, is another top manager with an international reputation in need of polishing. Mr. Hourican was formerly head of investment banking at Royal Bank of Scotland, one of Britain\u2019s largest banks. Mr. Hourican left R.B.S. in early 2013 after some of its traders were found to be involved in a conspiracy to fix benchmark interest rates. Mr. Hourican was not directly implicated, but he took responsibility and resigned.There are many reasons so many prominent names have come to Cyprus. One is simply to make a profit. Mr. Ross tripled his money investing in the Bank of Ireland, a commercial bank, when its ability to survive was in doubt during the financial crisis. If all goes well, the Bank of Cyprus could produce a similar payoff.For others, motivation includes a measure of absolution, even penitence.Mr. Hourican said that the chance to make amends drew him from London to the comparative obscurity of Cyprus. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can shy away from being collectively responsible\u201d for the financial crisis, Mr. Hourican said. \u201cIt is nice to come along and actually be able to fix the mistakes that did get made in places like Cyprus.\u201dNot that all Cypriots appreciated the effort. \u201cThey did burn my car,\u201d Mr. Hourican recalled.\u201cIt was a bit of sending a message to the bank: \u2018We\u2019re still angry.\u2019 I understand that,\u201d Mr. Hourican said, \u201cbut I\u2019d prefer if you hadn\u2019t torched my car.\u201dThis incident is not the reason he has decided to leave the Cyprus job in November, Mr. Hourican says. Rather, he wants to be closer to his wife and four children, who have continued to live primarily in their native Ireland, he says.The anger of some Cypriots is not surprising. Thousands of people lost money after their deposits were seized in 2013 to cover losses that the Cyprus banks absorbed on their holdings of Greek bonds. Some of the depositors were Russians stashing their money abroad, but many were Cypriots.Ironically, the losses were partly Mr. Ackermann\u2019s work. As chairman of the International Institute of Finance \u2014 an industry group that represents the interests of large investment banks like Deutsche, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 he played a primary role in negotiating an agreement that provided crucial debt relief for Greece.The deal caused enormous collateral damage in Cyprus, because banks here had invested heavily in Greek government debt, which lost about half its value. Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki Bank, the island\u2019s second-largest lender, collapsed and was absorbed by Bank of Cyprus.The recession that came after the Cyprus banking crisis, as well as a real estate bubble, left it with the highest rate of delinquent loans in the world. More than half of all its outstanding loans are considered nonperforming.But it will be tricky for the bank to use its new powers without generating enormous ill will.Mr. Ross, the American distressed-asset investor, says that the bank prefers to work out amicable settlements with borrowers and that it has no interest in seizing property when the real estate market is already depressed.\u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be mass foreclosures,\u201d Mr. Ross, who also serves on the Bank of Cyprus board as vice chairman, said by telephone. \u201cIf there are mass foreclosures, it would mean vast amounts of houses on the market at the same time, and that\u2019s not a good thing in terms of realizing your value.\u201dUnder Mr. Ackermann and Mr. Hourican, Bank of Cyprus has reduced its dependence on emergency loans from the European Central Bank, cut costs and decreased its dependence on borrowed money. Profits fell 26 percent in the first half of this year, to \u20ac60 million on revenue of \u20ac533 million, as the bank increased the amount of money it set aside to cover losses on bad loans. However, the total number of bad loans has started to decline for the first time since before the crisis began.The bank will probably also benefit from a recent upturn in the Cyprus economy, and the potential influx of wealth from newly discovered offshore deposits of natural gas. And the economy could collect a substantial peace dividend if current talks are successful in reuniting the Greek-speaking part of the island with an enclave in the north that has been occupied by Turkey since 1974.But Mr. Ackermann said the turnaround of the bank would take another two or three years. \u201cWe are certainly not yet there,\u201d he said.Mr. Ackermann\u2019s said it does not bother him that, if the turnaround succeeds, he would not share in the payoff beyond his 68,000 euro pay as bank chairman.\u201cI don\u2019t need charity,\u201d he said. \u201cI made enough money in my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s Student Revolt", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Last Wednesday, I arrived at the University of the Witwatersrand, where I work, and couldn\u2019t get inside. Some major entrances to the campus in the center of Johannesburg were locked. Others had been barricaded by students. The university had expected a docile, two-hour protest; instead, a week before exams, the campus was shut down by a crowd of 2,000. It\u2019s been closed ever since.Students at Wits, as it\u2019s known locally, are protesting because the poor are being priced out of higher education. For many of them, getting into a university is a triumph; but staying there is a miracle.Neither universities nor the government are doing nearly enough to help poor (which generally means black) students survive and graduate. The original impetus for the protests was a proposed 10.5-percent fee increase that would have locked some students out for life. A 10,000-rand (about $750) up-front fee would have prevented many existing students from registering and caused them to lose access to whatever funding or scholarships they had. In just one week, student demands evolved from canceling fee increases at Wits to a government commitment to publicly funded higher education (the government studied such a reform in 2012 but never released its findings to the public).On Friday President Jacob Zuma announced that there would be no fee increases in 2016. This is a significant victory but it\u2019s only the start of a larger struggle. The government has not committed to cover the shortfalls that universities will face or explained how it plans to fund higher education in the longer term. On Saturday, Wits students voted to continue the shutdown until the government addresses their demand for free education.These issues are real for students like Lebo, a 19-year-old black woman in her second year at Wits. She wakes up at around 5 a.m. each morning to take a packed minibus taxi from her township to the center of the city. From there she\u2019ll take another minibus to campus, or walk if money is tight. She\u2019ll bring leftovers, and if there aren\u2019t any she won\u2019t eat all day, because food on campus is expensive. She\u2019ll also stand in line for the computer lab for at least half an hour. When Internet is only available on your phone and your only computer access is on campus, you make your essay-writing time count. By afternoon she\u2019ll be hungry and tired, facing the long commute to a one-bedroom home shared with her grandmother and two sisters.Lebo is not unusual. At Wits there are 10,000 students on financial aid and many more who are struggling but aren\u2019t quite poor enough to merit state assistance. Close to 500,000 university students nationally, just under half of those enrolled, receive official state loans, which leaves many with fee shortfalls and little for living expenses.Across the country, university students and their families are still feeling the legacies of apartheid\u2019s poverty trap, which provided guaranteed jobs for whites and set up a substandard educational system for blacks designed to create a low-skilled, low-paid work force. Black students were prohibited from attending elite universities, and only a few well-connected black families could afford private schooling. Twenty years has not been enough to alter that, especially coupled with the abject failure of the African National Congress to provide decent primary and secondary education.Wits students have linked up with groups at other universities \u2014 last Wednesday\u2019s protests shut down campuses across South Africa \u2014 and, using social media and the force of their own bodies, they have sparked a national conversation about the value of higher education and the right of the poorest to access it. A group of between 300 and 1,000 students have occupied a central building on the Wits campus, while thousands more turn up daily to take part in the marches across the city. They\u2019ve made civil disobedience feel possible again. The atmosphere on Wits campus is like something out of a gauzy Bertolucci film about Paris in 1968. It should have been news, but for a while it wasn\u2019t.What was news, instead, was violence \u2014 which is strange because there has been virtually none. Mainstream press reporting, phone-in radio shows, social media and casual conversation were filled with talk about violence and whether the Wits students had \u201cdone it\u201d yet. People spoke about being intimidated, about volatile crowds, about feeling threatened and afraid. No one specified that these crowds were largely black; but then they didn\u2019t need to.It\u2019s more difficult to associate violence with these students after you\u2019ve seen them chased by police dogs, shot at with rubber bullets, attacked with tear gas and stun guns, and arrested for daring to protest outside Parliament. Nonetheless, an undercurrent remains: that somehow this treatment is, if not exactly deserved, then not surprising, given the students\u2019 supposed violence in taking over spaces, interrupting others\u2019 educational trajectories and generally \u201cmisbehaving.\u201dLast Monday, a white male driver attempted to run over students staging a sit-in on a busy road, after which a small group gave chase, and the driver was injured and his car damaged. Aside from this, academic staff have observed no acts of violence on the part of students, despite being pepper-sprayed by private security officials, rammed by the cars and motorbikes of wealthier (mostly white) students and injured by white police spouting racist epithets.Why, then, were many South Africans so quick to attribute violence to these students? The answer is depressingly simple. Even today, in a country that\u2019s majority black, a large group of young black people moving as a crowd means one thing only to the panicked public imagination: a threat that needs to be contained. This became clear last week when black students from the University of Cape Town, fearing for their safety as the largely black police contingent advanced on them, called on white classmates to form a human shield. They did, and the police retreated. Because even in South Africa, even now, unruly white bodies aren\u2019t threatening but unruly black bodies are.South Africa suffers from a shrinking economy, rising unemployment and crime rates bordering on the epidemic. For many families paying a $750 registration fee is impossible. Extending access to higher education is not some socialist dream; it\u2019s a vital part of stabilizing the country. And yet, many South Africans do not see what I\u2019ve seen this past week. They do not see the impressive discipline, careful political thought and deep commitment to a better future. They do not hear the great harmonies as anti-apartheid struggle songs are reborn. They do not feel joy, solidarity or hope. What they feel is fear, what they hear is disorder \u2014 and what they see is only the threat of violence.Advertisement"}

He was 82.His death was announced by his elected successor, Thomas Boni Yayi.Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou led Benin, an impoverished cotton-growing country the size of Pennsylvania on the Gulf of Guinea, in two different guises: as its strongman from 1972 to 1991, and as its democratically elected president from 1996 to 2005. In that transformation, from one to the other, is where is his most enduring legacy lies.Under pressure from a conference of prominent citizens he had convened, he agreed to hold free elections in 1991 and then agreed to give up power when he lost.The decision set off an unraveling of one-party rule across West Africa, inspiring movements toward multiparty democracy.Nicknamed the Chameleon for his protean politics, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou could also be mercurial in his behavior. On a trip to the United States in 1999, he stunned an all-black Baltimore church congregation by falling to his knees and begging forgiveness for the \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cabominable\u201d role that Africans played in the slave trade.In 1975, he burst into the home of his interior minister, found him committing adultery with Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou\u2019s wife, and ordered him shot to death as the man fled naked.Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou was born on Sept. 2, 1933, in Kouarfa, in the northwest of what was then Dahomey, a French colony. He studied at military schools there and in France, served as an aide to the Dahomeyan president after France granted the colony independence in 1960, and later became chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council after his cousin ousted the incumbent president.A lieutenant colonel at the time, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou seized power in 1972, in the fifth coup since the colony had become independent. (He was a general by the time he retired from the army in 1987.)Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou adopted a Marxist-Leninist platform two years after the coup, renamed the nation the People\u2019s Republic of Benin (after a kingdom that flourished in the 17th century) and nationalized its oil companies and banks.Over time his People\u2019s Revolutionary Party became less revolutionary and captivated fewer and fewer people, but Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou was nothing if not adaptable. (\u201cThe stick cannot break in the arms of a chameleon,\u201d he liked to say, and his own swagger stick was decorated with a picture of one.)He pursued an increasingly moderate socialist agenda as the economy worsened, following the lead of the Warsaw Pact nations in abandoning Marxism altogether in 1989.In his return to power in 1996 and again in 2001, he squeaked by to victory after disputed vote counts.The country\u2019s Constitution limited him to two terms and in any case barred him from running again because he was older than 70.Information on his survivors was not immediately available.In 2005, after dominating Beninese politics for nearly three decades \u2014 more than half the country\u2019s existence \u2014 Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, then 72, announced that he would not try to overturn the two-term limit.\u201cIf you don\u2019t leave power,\u201d he said, \u201cpower will leave you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bernanke were to write a sequel to his recently published memoir, \u201cThe Courage to Act,\u201d he might well want to call it \u201cThe Courage Not to Act.\u201dFor that\u2019s what the Federal Reserve needs at its rate-setting meeting today and at least some of those to follow \u2014 the fortitude to resist the mounting pressure to raise interest rates from their near-zero level.To a significant clutch of Fed policy makers and the perennial chorus of inflation worriers have been added new voices, ranging from emerging-market countries feeling \u201cFed fatigue\u201d as their currencies gyrate with each round of speculation to leading businessmen to presidential hopefuls like Donald J. Trump.I stand with Ms. Brainard and Mr. Tarullo: The Fed should step back from its implicit commitment to raise rates this year and hold firm until there is clear evidence of inflationary conditions.Currently the economy is expanding at just over a 2 percent rate with little reason to expect improvement. Important sectors, from business investment to retail sales, are anemic.Should the economy once again sag, the Fed still has tools at its disposal, such as renewing its bond buying. And other policy makers could legislate tax cuts or spending increases.Indeed, in a better world, we would not even be relying so heavily on the central bank to stimulate our lagging economy; a more expansionary fiscal policy would also be playing a part.More balanced economic policies would also help address another criticism of low interest rates: their propensity to increase income inequality by inflating the value of stocks and other assets that are disproportionately owned by the wealthy.To conservatives, rising asset prices signal greater chances of another meltdown, similar to what occurred in the mid-2000s. But the stock market is down 3 percent since its peak in May. And housing prices have yet to return to pre-crisis levels.With 11.4 million new jobs, and no inflation in sight, perhaps we can agree that the Fed\u2019s full-throated efforts to stimulate the economy were a constructive contributor to our recovery.For nearly seven years, members of the Federal Open Market Committee have dutifully gathered every six weeks or so, pondered bits and bytes of economic data and decided not to change interest rates.Until the evidence indicating a need to begin raising rates becomes compelling, I\u2019m hoping that the inaction faction prevails over the action faction.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Heading into the United Nations climate summit meeting in Paris in December, all the world\u2019s largest industrial economies are now taking climate change more seriously. This includes the United States \u2014 except for some of the knuckleheads running to be our next president, which is not a small problem.When, at CNN\u2019s G.O.P. presidential debate, the moderator Jake Tapper read statements from Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state George Shultz (who drives an electric car powered by solar panels on his home\u2019s roof) about how Reagan urged industry to proactively address ozone depletion, and why Shultz believes we should be just as proactive today in dealing with climate change, he got the usual know-nothing responses.Senator Marco Rubio said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do,\u201d while Gov. Chris Christie opined of Shultz, \u201cListen, everybody makes a mistake every once in a while.\u201dBut hey, stuff just happens.There was a time when we could tolerate this kind of dumb-as-we-wanna-be thinking. But it\u2019s over. The next eight years will be critical for the world\u2019s climate and ecosystems, and if you vote for a climate skeptic for president, you\u2019d better talk to your kids first, because you will have to answer to them later.Rockstrom begins his argument with a reminder that for most of the earth\u2019s 4.5-billion-year history its climate was not very hospitable to human beings, as it oscillated between \u201cpunishing ice ages and lush warm periods\u201d that locked humanity into seminomadic lifestyles.It\u2019s only been in the last 10,000 years that we have enjoyed the stable climate conditions allowing civilizations to develop based on agriculture that could support towns and cities. This period, known as the Holocene, was an \u201calmost miraculously stable and warm interglacial equilibrium, which is the only state of the planet we know for sure can support the modern world as we know it.\u201d It finally gave us \u201ca stable equilibrium of forests, savannahs, coral reefs, grasslands, fish, mammals, bacteria, air quality, ice cover, temperature, fresh water availability and productive soils.\u201dIt \u201cis our Eden,\u201d Rockstrom added, and now \u201cwe are threatening to push earth out of this sweet spot,\u201d starting in the mid-1950s, when the Industrial Revolution reached most of the rest of the globe and populations and middle classes exploded. That triggered \u201cthe great acceleration\u201d of industrial and farming growth, which has put all of earth\u2019s ecosystems under stress. The impacts now are obvious: \u201cclimate change, chemical pollution, air pollution, land and water degradation \u2026 and the massive loss of species and habitats.\u201dWe\u2019re sitting on these planetary boundaries right now, argues Rockstrom, and if these systems flip from one stable state to another \u2014 if the Amazon tips into a savannah, if the Arctic loses its ice cover and instead of reflecting the sun\u2019s rays starts absorbing them in water, if the glaciers all melt and cannot feed the rivers \u2014 nature will be fine, but we will not be.This is what will greet the next president \u2014 a resilient planet that could once absorb our excesses at seemingly no cost to us, suddenly tipping into a saturated planet, sending us \u201cdaily invoices\u201d that will get bigger each year.

{"Headline": "Formula One Makes the Old New Again in Mexico", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Mexican Grand PrixWhen tickets went on sale in March for the race this weekend, they were sold out in four hours. To meet the demand, the promoters decided to build more seats, selling tickets again in June.But Federico Gonz\u00e1lez Compe\u00e1n, general director of the race and managing director of the company promoting it, Grupo CIE, or Corporaci\u00f3n Interamericana de Entretenimiento, said the new incarnation of the race would be something quite different than the last Grand Prix run on the same track two decades ago.\u201cWhat is going to change from 23 years ago is that it is just a different country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a completely different spirit, energy and passion in the people.\u201dThe race this weekend is running at the same circuit in Mexico City that first hosted a Formula One race in 1963. The track and facilities have been entirely renovated, however, in a project overseen by Hermann Tilke, the German architect who has designed or redesigned most of the series\u2019s modern circuits. The old pit buildings were torn down; the track was redrawn in many areas and entirely resurfaced; a new medical facility was built to today\u2019s standards, and more grandstands were added.While fans and drivers have often criticized the modern tracks designed by Tilke as being too slow, safe and uniform, Emerson Fittipaldi, a two-time world champion from Brazil, said that much of the old thrill of the Mexican track had been maintained.\u201cTilke is redoing the track but keeping the same character of the track from the \u201960s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt still has its very fast section of esses and still has very long straights and is very attractive to drive. And it has completely new facilities \u2014 in the paddock area the suites are beautiful.\u201dThe Mexican government and private industry invested about $200 million for the makeover. Many of the new races added to the calendar have similar financing arrangements. In the new Formula One-as-entertainment era, is fitting that the Mexican Grand Prix promoter, and major investor, is an entertainment company, Grupo CIE, the third-largest entertainment company in the world. It promotes concerts, theater productions and sporting events in Latin America and elsewhere.Today, Mexico also has its own Nascar series, as well as other racing series.\u201cWith the new circuit in Mexico City coming, again the future of Formula One is guaranteed to be on our side of the world,\u201d Fittipaldi said. \u201cIt is very important for the racing fans in North America and for the racing fans in Latin America. It is a big goal because there are a lot of events in Asia, and in Russia, and in Europe. So it is very important to have two events on our side of the world.\u201dThere is another back story to the races in Austin, the Texas state capital, and Mexico City, though. One of the main entrepreneurs behind the Texas race was Tavo Hellmund, a former racing car driver and race promoter from Austin. He was responsible for starting the project in the city and having the track built, but was then squeezed out by associates.Ecclestone then asked Hellmund if he would like to work on bringing a Grand Prix back to Mexico.The project has caused some friction in Austin, where for the first three years the U.S. Grand Prix drew many Mexican fans who lived within a relatively short drive from the U.S. circuit. But last weekend, Mexican attendance was down, with many apparently opting to attend their home race this weekend instead.While the series continues to struggle to hook fans in the United States, P\u00e9rez, 25, said that would not be a problem in Mexico.\u201cIt already took off many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 23 years since we raced there, but Mexico itself has a lot of history. It\u2019s not like going into a new venue. We are returning to a track. Obviously it\u2019s not Germany, it\u2019s not England, those places with a lot of culture in the sport, but there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm from the fans, and the fans are really looking forward to receiving the sport.\u201dThe Mexican Grand Prix ran from 1963 to 1970 and then again from 1986 to 1992, both stints hugely successful among the fans. The most memorable race was probably in 1970.\u201cI was there in 1970 and it was one of my first Grands Prix in my career, when Pedro Rodr\u00edguez was driving,\u201d Fittipaldi, now 68, recalled. \u201cThere were so many people \u2014 the public was jumping over the fence and sitting on the guardrail before the race.\u201dIn fact, the fans had invaded the track before the race, sitting on the tarmac. There were 200,000 people in attendance, and many broke down fences and went onto the track, with the British driver Jackie Stewart and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez calling for calm.\u201cThe crowd came on to the track and sat there cross-legged with their sombreros on,\u201d Stewart recalled, \u201cand they would not move. The organizers said, \u2018Look, you are the world champion \u2014 if you and Pedro go around, they will go back.\u2019 Sure enough, we did that and they went back; then we went to the next crowd and the first lot all came back and took up their places on the track again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin, Citing Key Moment, Prods West to Cooperate on Syria", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday made his strongest pitch yet for cooperation between Washington and Moscow in Syria and beyond, calling it a crucial moment in East-West relations not unlike the end of the Cold War.Speaking before a gathering of global experts on Russia, Mr. Putin also released a few details from his surprise meeting here with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, on Tuesday, saying Mr. Assad said Damascus was willing to make common cause with the armed opponents as long as they were willing to fight the Islamic State.Mr. Putin shared the stage in the southern resort town of Sochi with Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Parliament in Iran, which is allied with Russia in fighting in Syria. Both men rejected proposals for Syria\u2019s partition, calling those a formula for endless warfare and dangerous gains by the militants.The Russian leader seemed at times to be doubling down on his charm offensive toward Washington and the West, a critical part of his strategy of intervening in Syria in the first place, analysts have said. By changing the subject from the Ukraine crisis and playing peacemaker in Syria, many say, he aims to break out of the Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine at a time when low oil prices have walloped the Russian economy.The Russian president revealed that the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State was close to sharing intelligence on the positions and movements of the militants. Russia and the United States have already reached an agreement on sharing the airspace over Syria, he noted.What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.\u201cSyria, despite the dramatic situation there now, might become a model for partnership for the sake of our joint interests, for the resolution of our problems, which concern everyone, for working out an effective system of risk management,\u201d Mr. Putin said, seemingly laying out a broader plan for global cooperation with the United States and the West in general.\u201cWe had this chance once after the end of the Cold War; unfortunately, we didn\u2019t use it,\u201d Mr. Putin told the annual gathering of academics and other Russia experts known as the Valdai Discussion Club. Another chance was missed during the terrorist upsurge in the early 2000s, he said.He said he hoped the beginning of such cooperation would emerge from talks scheduled in Vienna on Friday between the foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as well as the American secretary of state, John Kerry. Iran should be included, he said.Mr. Putin unleashed some of his standard criticism of the United States, too, accusing it of seeking to dominate the world alone. Some Americans in the audience pushed back. A former ambassador, Jack F. Matlock Jr., suggested that Russia should stop blaming the West for conspiring to cause the collapse of the Soviet Union, given its internal weaknesses and the Kremlin\u2019s own decisions at the time.Yet even when compared with the comparatively restrained tone of Mr. Putin\u2019s address to the United Nations at the end of September, some audience members said they could not remember him making such an ardent appeal for a different relationship with Washington.\u201cThose are the most hopeful words I have heard from Putin on U.S.-Russia relations in years,\u201d said Clifford Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy organization, who was in the audience. \u201cI think he wants at least peaceful coexistence with the U.S.\u201d in hopes that the European Union will lift sanctions next year, he said.A drastic escalation of fighting in Aleppo has shattered a partial truce.Mr. Kupchan said he doubted that the White House would be very receptive, as the Obama administration and the American public both find the idea of cooperating with Mr. Putin distasteful. \u201cHe might have five letters in his name but he is still a four-letter word in Washington,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said.Mr. Putin said he believed it was time to strengthen Syria, not further destabilize it.Asked if Russia had a plan for Syria and was confident that it could avoid creating the kind of chaos that has followed other foreign interventions, Mr. Putin said there was no \u201cinsurance.\u201d Calling himself a big fan of cockpit videos, he said he believed the Russian Air Force was effective and indicated that he had discussed various scenarios with Mr. Assad.\u201cI will pull back the curtain a little on my talks with President Assad,\u201d Mr. Putin said, adding that he had proposed providing Russian support to armed opposition groups in Syria that are willing to fight the Islamic State.\u201cWhat would be your view if we were to support their efforts in fighting the Islamic State in the same way we are supporting the Syrian Army?\u201d Mr. Putin said he asked, and Mr. Assad answered, \u201cI would view that positively.\u201dThe Russian president said that Moscow is now trying to organize the practical side of that. He criticized the United States for providing antitank missiles to the rebels and said he hoped it would be wise enough not to provide hand-held antiaircraft weapons, in that both were likely to fall into the hands of militant organizations.Mr. Putin reiterated that any political transition in Syria would have to be carried out by the current government, but that it should be a transparent process with international monitoring.Mr. Larijani used the opportunity to make a dig at Iran\u2019s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, for demanding that Mr. Assad step down in favor of a more democratic Syria. \u201cThose who do not allow their women to drive cars, they talk about democracy in Syria,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil and Gas Companies Make Statement in Support of U.N. Climate Goals", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Ten of the world\u2019s big oil companies, mainly from Europe, jointly acknowledged on Friday that their industry must help address global climate change and said that they agreed with the United Nations\u2019 goals of limiting global warming.But the impact of that statement might be limited.None of the biggest American oil companies signed the declaration or were part of the group. The companies that were involved \u2014 including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Saudi Aramco and Total \u2014 made no specific commitments toward helping to meet the climate challenge. Instead, they indicated they would await government regulations to chart the way forward.Robert Dudley, an American who is chief executive of BP, the oil company based in London, expressed optimism on Friday, despite the lack of participation by companies from the United States. \u201cI think we can make the difference,\u201d Mr. Dudley, who is chairman of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, told reporters in Paris. \u201cAlmost every company here has large investments in the United States.\u201dBy recognizing that goal, the executives are putting themselves in a tricky position. Meeting that target would require leaving much of the world\u2019s existing oil, gas and coal reserves unburned and would require the companies to make major changes in the way they do business.Many experts, including people in the oil industry, doubt that the goal can be met.The executives acknowledged that \u201cthe existing trend of the world\u2019s net global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with this ambition.\u201d In other words, the world\u2019s factories and vehicles are still pumping out far too much carbon dioxide.But the executives, who said their companies provided nearly 10 percent of the world\u2019s energy, did not commit to any new limits on their own activities. Instead, they left it up to governments to establish regulations and other measures that would encourage them \u201cto take informed decisions and make effective and sustainable contributions to addressing climate change.\u201dNeil Beveridge, an oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the industry deserved credit at least for acknowledging its role in climate change. \u201cIt is a big, big step for such a large number of companies to gather,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the years, a lot of companies have been in denial on this issue.\u201dBut Anthony Hobley, chief executive of Carbon Tracker, a London organization that advises on the risks of investing in energy companies, noted the limits of Friday\u2019s statement. \u201cThere was no commitment to get out ahead of government,\u201d he said.American giants like Chevron and ExxonMobil are among those that appear to disapprove of the European-led initiative, partly because the potential remedies \u2014 like carbon taxes or the trading of carbon-emission permits \u2014 that many experts say are necessary to curb greenhouse gases would almost inevitably raise the price of their fuels.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a customer come to me and ask to pay a higher price for oil, gas or other products,\u201d John S. Watson, the chief executive of Chevron, told a meeting hosted in June in Vienna by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Rex W. Tillerson, ExxonMobil\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly said that he would support putting a price on carbon as long as it was \u201crevenue neutral.\u201dAn explicit call for putting a high price on carbon emissions was deliberately omitted from Friday\u2019s declaration. Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of the Italian oil company Eni, and a participant in the group, said in an interview on Friday that most of his European colleagues agreed that some form of carbon levy would eventually be essential.\u201cCarbon pricing is the only way to have a reasonable energy mix\u201d to sustain the 3.6-degree ceiling, he said. But he said Friday\u2019s declaration used less-specific language to bring some of the international companies on board. \u201cNow we are trying to create a consensus,\u201d he said.The other members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative are Statoil of Norway; Repsol of Spain; the Mexican company Pemex; the Indian company Reliance Industries; and the BG Group of Britain.The United Nations goal of limiting global warming to about 3.6 degrees is based on a comparison to temperatures in the preindustrial 19th century. That level of warming, although potentially producing dire effects on agriculture, sea level and the natural world, could stave off the most severe impacts of drought, food and water shortages, and widespread flooding \u2014 events that could profoundly harm the world\u2019s population and economy.But to achieve that limit would require severe reductions in carbon emissions by 2050.The companies\u2019 statement on Friday included a list of ways they said they would collaborate to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions. Those included cleaning up their own operations and reducing methane emissions that escape from oil and gas installations.\u201cTechnologies can deliver the solutions for the future,\u201d Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Total\u2019s chief executive, said in Paris on Friday. \u201cOn this climate change, we prefer to collaborate rather than to compete.\u201dThe companies also said they would work with automakers and consumers to improve vehicle fuel economy. Big on the companies\u2019 agenda, too, are efforts to give natural gas a bigger share of the global energy mix.Of the group, Shell and Total in particular have invested heavily in natural-gas-related businesses in recent years. They portray natural gas as a fossil fuel that produces fewer carbon emissions than oil \u2014 and much less than coal, which is dirtier and often cheaper than natural gas.\u201cWe have to shift from coal to gas so there is an opportunity here,\u201d Josu Jon Imaz of Repsol said on Friday in Paris.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the title of Robert Dudley. He is chief executive of BP, not chairman.Lilia Blaise contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

In contrast to past efforts to reduce greenhouse gases by assigning specific emissions levels only to industrialized countries, while giving developing countries like India a pass (an approach that met with stiff resistance in the United States), the Paris conference is asking every country to create its own plan.Even now, India, unlike the United States and China, is resisting an absolute cap on emissions, instead pledging to lower the rate of increase from burning fossil fuels while investing heavily in wind, solar and other clean-energy alternatives. India claims that under the plan its economy can still grow sevenfold by 2030 from 2005 levels, while carbon emissions will only triple. But the very fact that India has signed on is a breakthrough.Eventually, of course, India will have to do better, as will every country. According to Climate Interactive, a group whose analyses are used by the United States and many other governments, all the pledges made so far would allow the Earth to heat up by more than 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit. That\u2019s less than the 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit it would reach without the pledges, but it\u2019s far from the stated goal of limiting global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, beyond which the world\u2019s natural systems could be in deep trouble, with widespread droughts, steadily rising sea levels, species loss and catastrophic storms.Transparency \u2014 a divisive issue at the last big climate summit meeting, in Copenhagen in 2009 \u2014 is critical.The hope in Paris must be that once it becomes clear that carbon emissions can be reduced equitably and at a lower cost than once feared, countries will assume greater responsibility for saving the planet.Advertisement"}

The Newport Bermuda Race already arrives every two years.But staging the 2017 America\u2019s Cup was much more of a stretch considering that Oracle Team USA, the syndicate that holds the trophy, is American, and that Bermuda, despite accepting American dollars in its shops and restaurants, is a British overseas territory with a population of only about 65,000 and was bidding against major American cities like San Diego and Chicago.When Russell Coutts, the former star helmsman for Oracle who is now head of the America\u2019s Cup event authority, first suggested that Bermuda bid for the Cup, local leaders said they were incredulous.\u201cIt was, \u2018You\u2019ve been hit in the head by the boom too many times. What are you talking about, man?\u201d\u2019 said Peter Durhager, now chairman of the America\u2019s Cup Bermuda Development Authority, the ACBDA.At that stage, the Bermudians were only aspiring to hold a warm-up event, like the Louis Vuitton America\u2019s Cup World Series regatta it will stage here on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But urged on by Coutts and by their research, they were soon in the hunt for the main event.\u201cWe actually thought we were the stalking horse, that we were there to encourage the U.S. cities to be serious,\u201d said Michael Winfield, ACBDA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen they actually wrote to us confirming that we had won, we actually had the lawyers check the letter because we couldn\u2019t find the loophole. It took the lawyers two days to go through a two-paragraph letter and say in fact that there was no loophole. You\u2019ve got it.\u201dIf sailing were a major sport in the United States instead of a niche diversion, the decision by Coutts and Oracle\u2019s billionaire owner, Larry Ellison, to take the regatta outside the country might have caused a nationalistic uproar. Instead, the surprise move reverberated mainly inside yachting circles.Malin Burnham, the American businessman who led San Diego\u2019s unsuccessful bid, was outraged.\u201cIt\u2019s confidential, so I can\u2019t relate the party\u2019s name,\u201d Burnham said. \u201cBut one of the America\u2019s Cup backers who was a nationally known figure wrote Russell a note, and among other things this party said was that this was the first time the America\u2019s Cup had been prostituted.\u201dAsked if he thought \u201cprostituted\u201d was too strong a term, Burnham answered: \u201cNot at all.\u201dThe America\u2019s Cup is the oldest major international sporting event. Since it began in 1851, only one team had chosen to defend the trophy outside its home waters. That was the Swiss syndicate Alinghi, which chose Valencia, Spain, in 2007 but only because Switzerland is a landlocked Alpine nation with no seacoast. Oracle\u2019s choice was different and entirely optional.\u201cI think there was in all honesty some complacency with the U.S. venues,\u201d Coutts, a New Zealander, said in an interview last week in Hamilton, Bermuda\u2019s capital. \u201cThey never thought, frankly, we would have the guts to take it outside the United States, and we just looked at it logically. And I\u2019m absolutely convinced it\u2019s the right decision.\u201dThough the choice has its potential negatives, including the ocean that separates Bermuda from any major population center, one can understand the mutual attraction.For Bermuda, which has had to muddle through uncharacteristically lean times in recent years, this is a chance to stimulate its economy, inspire its populace, raise its global profile and boost high-end tourism, including the affluent super-yacht community if new facilities prove an effective magnet after the Cup.\u201cMy interest in doing this is it\u2019s one part about a sailboat race and nine parts about other stuff,\u201d Durhager said.For Coutts and Oracle, this is a chance to come to a venue where the Cup and its challenger series will be the main attraction instead of the sideshow it was in booming San Francisco in 2013.\u201cThe people here are just so into it; it\u2019s like going to Augusta where it\u2019s all about the golf,\u201d said Jimmy Spithill, Oracle\u2019s skipper.The government and business community in Bermuda is also easier to navigate than in San Francisco with its difficult political climate for waterfront initiatives. Bermuda is in the process of building an America\u2019s Cup event village on about 10 acres of reclaimed land in the harbor at the Royal Naval Dockyard, although there has been some concern expressed about the project by local environment advocates.Though crowds are expected to be much smaller than in San Francisco, the time zone is advantageous for television: one hour ahead of New York and five behind Paris and much of Continental Europe (with challengers from Britain and France, European prime time is particularly important).An American venue like Newport, R.I., could have provided some time-zone benefit, but the American venues were not offering the same incentives as Bermuda, which agreed to pay $15 million as the cost of entry over a three-year period as well as underwrite a $25 million guarantee against commercial sponsorship.\u201cWe get a certain percentage of anything Bermuda introduces so there\u2019s a way to claw back that guarantee, and that\u2019s been happening already,\u201d said Grant Gibbons, Bermuda\u2019s minister of economic development. Gibbons estimated Bermuda\u2019s capital and operational expenditures at $35 million to $40 million.Though some in the Cup community maintain that Bermuda overpaid, Durhager disagrees and said initial projections in 2014 were that \u201cwe were going to spend roughly $75 million and we\u2019re going to earn somewhere around $250 million on a direct impact basis.\u201d\u201cEveryone has to keep their own counsel,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is another event worth in a city the size of San Diego, where you have professional sports teams and major conference business with millions of people a year going through your city? What\u2019s that worth compared to a country that is 22 square miles? It\u2019s very different, so one is an apple and one is a pomegranate, not even an orange. So you can\u2019t compare the two.\u201d \u201cIf I look through their lens, why would we in Bermuda spend this kind of money to attract this kind of event?,\u201d he said. \u201cFair enough. That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d It is also fair to say that the America\u2019s Cup just might be the only significant global sporting event that Bermuda could attract in light of its location and demographics.Bean, the pastor in St. George\u2019s who was once in the British Merchant Navy and knows his port from his starboard, embodies the acute local interest but also understands the common people\u2019s expectations.\u201cHow it will trickle down is important,\u201d he said of the Cup\u2019s benefits.Coutts has been instrumental in creating a youth sailing program with a technological and environmental component for Bermudian schoolchildren. The steadily growing Cup community is renting houses and apartments, buying cars and groceries.The consensus for now is that Bermuda is a pleasant place to count down the days and nights to 2017 as well as a remarkable place to sail with its varying conditions and the natural amphitheater of the Great Sound that should provide enough runway for the high-speed, foiling catamarans that will contest the World Series this week and eventually the Cup.\u201cThis is the best sailing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Tom Slingsby, Oracle\u2019s well-traveled tactician. \u201cYou get the full wind range here, beautiful scenery and clear water. I saw a manta ray jumping in the air yesterday. Turtles, fish everywhere. It\u2019s great out there.\u201dIn light of an American team\u2019s unprecedented decision to defend the Cup outside of the United States of America, that seems a necessity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Passes Budget Bill and Sends It to Obama", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate approved a crucial bipartisan budget agreement early Friday that would avert a government default and end nearly five years of pitched battles between congressional Republicans and the Obama administration over fiscal policy.The measure, which passed 64 to 35, now goes to the White House, where President Obama has said he will sign it.\u201cThis agreement is a reminder that Washington can still choose to help, rather than hinder, America\u2019s progress,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement.Since passing the Budget Control Act, Congress has made adjustments each year to raise federal spending caps.Though modest in scope, especially in the context of the nearly $4 trillion annual budget, the accord represents a significant breakthrough.While Congress must still adopt spending bills for the next two years, the bill will substantially reduce the risk of a government shutdown by setting spending targets for two years and allowing Congress to return to its regular appropriations process.Senate leaders in each party had expressed support for the measure.Mr. McConnell added, \u201cI hope senators will join me in voting for it.\u201d Enough did.But some of his fellow Republican senators, including three presidential candidates \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 were fiercely opposed. The rare overnight voting, beginning with a 1 a.m. procedural measure and ending with final passage shortly after 3 a.m., was a consequence of the bitter disagreement among Republicans. In the end, 18 Republicans joined Democrats in supporting final passage, while all 35 no votes came from Republicans.The critics said that many of the cuts were gimmicks and that the package over all would add to the nation\u2019s debt.They also said it would breach spending caps they considered a much-needed step toward responsible cost controls. Democrats have long called for lifting the caps, which they say have hurt the economy and blocked needed investments in infrastructure and other programs.\u201cUltimately, there was something passed called sequestration, which put caps on both military and domestic spending, and it did slow down the rate of growth of government for a little while,\u201d Mr. Paul said in a speech. \u201cThis is the problem with Congress. Congress will occasionally do something in the right direction, and then they take one step forward and two steps back.\u201dSenator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said people in his state did not buy arguments for the budget accord. \u201cIt was announced by the White House today that this is a great job-creating achievement,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all they see is more spending and no change in the status quo.\u201dMr. Lankford criticized two of the spending cuts as illusions. One, he said, would slightly move up the due date of pension insurance premiums to the federal government. That would allow the money to be captured within the 10-year window used for budget-scoring purposes.\u201cYes, it adds $2.3 billion into the 10-year window,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually zero savings. It\u2019s not real. They moved a payment a month and said it\u2019s a pay-for. It\u2019s not a pay-for.\u201dMr. Lankford said another part of the plan would divert $1.5 billion from a fund to compensate crime victims. \u201cApparently, this budget agreement qualifies, though, as a victim of crime, because $1.5 billion is taken from the Crime Victims Fund and dedicated not to victims of crime but to spending in other areas,\u201d he said.Supporters of the measure said it represented a true bipartisan compromise in that neither side was fully satisfied.The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, applauded the passage of the bill.\u201cToday\u2019s vote is a victory for bipartisanship and for the American people,\u201d Mr. Reid said in a statement after the vote. \u201cTogether, Democrats and Republicans have proven that, when partisan agendas are set aside, we can find common ground for the common good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Right-Wing Party Roars Back in Polish Elections", "Date": "2015-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrivate exit polls, released immediately after voting ended Sunday evening, showed the party, Law and Justice, drawing 39.1 percent of the vote, trouncing Civic Platform, the center-right party that has led Poland since 2007, which got 23.4 percent.Law and Justice immediately declared victory and Civic Platform conceded defeat, although the final results will not be made official until Tuesday.\u201cPolish life can be different,\u201d said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Law and Justice. \u201cWe can be proud of it. We will never have to be ashamed of ourselves, as we did many times in the past, through no fault of ours.\u201dArgentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.Although the two parties have had extremely tense relations for many years, Mr. Kaczynski urged his supporters to put that in the past, but then added a jab of his own.\u201cThere will be no vengeance,\u201d he said. \u201cNo personal conflicts, no getting even, no kicking of those who fell \u2014 even if they fell because of themselves, and rightly so.\u201dA somber Civic Platform conceded defeat and touted its accomplishments.\u201cWe haven\u2019t wasted these eight years,\u201d said Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz. \u201cPoland today is a country which develops economically with single-digit unemployment. This is the state we\u2019re leaving Poland to those who won the election.\u201dIn an especially telling result, highlighting how Poland was joining many regional neighbors in a shift to the right, none of the country\u2019s left-wing or social democratic parties appeared to have qualified for seats in Parliament for the first time in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\u201cLet us not lose spirit,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, head of the Left Alliance. \u201cAlthough society tell us, \u2018No, we want the right,\u2019 we do know that the time for the left will come and then we will be waiting, strong and determined, with our heads high.\u201dWith 38 million residents, Poland is both the largest and the most economically vibrant nation in Eastern Europe and has emerged in recent years as a regional leader. Still, disenchanted voters have proved increasingly tired of hearing about a thriving economy that they feel has left too many behind and that still lags far behind those of more prosperous, Western European nations.Under Poland\u2019s complex voting rules, a party can take control of the government without the need for a coalition partner even if it draws less than 40 percent of the vote, depending on how many of the smaller parties cross the 5 percent threshold required to earn seats in the new Parliament.Although the exit polls seemed to suggest that Law and Justice might end up with a majority in Parliament while three smaller parties drew enough votes to get in, as well, the official roster of those that were able to cross the threshold will not be released until Monday. Only then will it become clear whether Law and Justice can form a government on its own, or will need to seek a coalition partner.\u201cThe carnival that is the election is over,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski told Law and Justice supporters on Sunday. \u201cNow it is time for real work. We must remember about modesty, which binds us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Advisers Woo Biden Backers, but Resistance Lingers", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile some prominent Biden admirers say they will now support her, others are expressing reluctance, and several are resisting \u2014 citing concerns about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s electability, the threat of the investigation into her email practices as secretary of state, or a lack of enthusiasm for a veteran combatant in the country\u2019s political wars.While advisers said they wanted to give some of Mr. Biden\u2019s most devoted supporters time to absorb the vice president\u2019s decision, they did not wait to begin reaching out to others, or to uncommitted Democrats, to express admiration for Mr. Biden and attest to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s commitment to the working-class and middle-class Americans with whom he has long identified.No sooner had the vice president finished his remarks than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aides and field organizers in Iowa began hours of phone calls to supporters of Mr. Biden. And some of her lieutenants in New Hampshire were calling and emailing uncommitted state lawmakers and county officials into the night to seek their backing.\u201cThat\u2019s 3 for 3 \u2014 you\u2019re batting 1.000,\u201d said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a supporter of Mr. Biden who said he would now back Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThis is somebody who has been tested. When she gets knocked down, she\u2019s going to get back up.\u201dLou Frillman, a Seattle-based donor who, along with his wife, Carol, raised more than $700,000 for the Obama-Biden ticket in 2012, and who met with Mr. Biden last month to discuss the race, said he received calls from supporters of Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday and told them he would back her. But Mr. Frillman, like some other donors, also slipped in hints about his own expectations for Mrs. Clinton.Leading one conference call, Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign\u2019s communications director, argued that the Benghazi committee was facing credibility problems and that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech at Saturday\u2019s dinner in Des Moines would be the start of \u201ca new phase of the campaign\u201d focused on winning the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses. An uncommitted Democrat on the call provided access to a reporter to listen; afterward, this Democrat still expressed reluctance to support Mrs. Clinton, citing the F.B.I. inquiry related to her email practices at the State Department.Such lingering questions have exasperated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters, but they see an opening now.\u201cThe frustrating thing is that the policy she has laid out has gotten such little coverage because of the emails and this pretend Benghazi committee,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \u201cI think the debate is where she began to reassert herself as the most substantive, stable and strong Democrat in the race. And now, hopefully, with Joe\u2019s decision, we can begin to focus not on the horse race and personalities, but on policy.\u201dWith Mr. Biden not running, the email inquiry may be the most significant potential obstacle for Mrs. Clinton, given that a damaging outcome would probably lead some Democrats to consider alternative candidates or even try to draft a last-minute white knight. She also faces a spirited challenge for the nomination from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, though his advisers had been hoping he would benefit from a split among moderate Democrats between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden.While some Clinton backers were privately hopeful on Wednesday that her strong October could let her lock down the nomination in a single month, other Democrats cautioned against presuming anything until votes are cast. And some who said they expected to wind up in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s corner expressed misgivings about a speedier-than-expected end to the contest.Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania, an admirer of Mr. Biden\u2019s who on Monday predicted that the vice president would run, said that he expected to endorse Mrs. Clinton eventually but that voters would benefit from a longer Democratic race.\u201cWhat Bernie Sanders is bringing up is really important to me, speaking to the angst that many Democrats feel about the economy,\u201d Mr. Boyle said. \u201cI think the debate that the Democratic candidates are still having is a healthy one for Americans to listen to.\u201dSome Biden backers and other uncommitted Democrats were more grudgingly resigned to embracing Mrs. Clinton. Jim Torrey, a financier and fund-raiser who supported Mr. Biden, vented about the lack of presidential options Democrats had \u2014 \u201cWe have no bench,\u201d he said \u2014 and suggested he would focus more on helping the party take back control of the Senate.\u201cWill I write her a check?\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be compelled to. But she has enough help. I\u2019m interested in getting back five Senate seats.\u201dIn Iowa, where Mr. Biden still has friends from his 1987 presidential bid, admirers of the vice president expressed sadness and said they were in no rush to get behind Mrs. Clinton. State Senator Tony Bisignano said his lunch on Wednesday was interrupted by calls from aides to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders seeking his support after Mr. Biden\u2019s noontime announcement.\u201cI\u2019m probably going to do the right thing to make sure we retain our caucuses,\u201d Mr. Bisignano said, indicating he would support Mrs. Clinton in the hope that doing so would ultimately help preserve Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation vote. \u201cBut not yet. In a few weeks, I\u2019ll decide what I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s disappointing because my heart was with Biden.\u201dAmong donors who had pledged to support Mr. Biden, there was similar frustration \u2014 mixed with a sense of resignation that the nomination of Mrs. Clinton was inevitable.\u201cI\u2019m just not inspired the way I was when the president first ran,\u201d said David Kenney, a Democratic lobbyist in Denver who raised more than a million dollars for Mr. Obama in 2012.Some Biden admirers as yet sound far from resigned to falling in line behind Mrs. Clinton.Nancy C. Jacobson, a Democratic superdelegate from Florida, said she had been hoping Mr. Biden would run and still had reservations about Mrs. Clinton because of her memories of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, \u201cwhich was mostly on the side of corporations and the banks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaning more toward Senator Sanders,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about regular working people.\u201dAnd Richard A. Harpootlian, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said he feared that Mrs. Clinton was too unpopular to win swing states like Colorado, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia \u2014 all states won by Mr. Obama in 2008. Carrying those states, he warned, could be especially critical if the 2016 Republican ticket includes former Gov. Jeb Bush or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, because those two battleground states could favor the Republicans.\u201cHillary just has huge problems right now in terms of getting elected next November,\u201d said Mr. Harpootlian, who noted that he received a call from an adviser to another Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, shortly after Mr. Biden\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe still have thinking to do as a party about the kind of candidate who can win in 2016,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Manufacturing Sector Courts the World, but Pitfalls Remain", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile the company still sources expensive, complex toys like the electronic FurReal Friends from China, Hasbro has contracts for production in Turkey, Indonesia, Vietnam and Mexico. It has moved most aggressively into India, where Hasbro buys from several sizable factories, and another is planned.Multinationals around the globe have begun to look seriously at manufacturing in India, with its plentiful and inexpensive labor pool. But the investment doesn\u2019t mean doing business in India is getting easier. Rather, it is a sign that doing business in China is getting more difficult.The Hong Kong-based Musical Group decided to build the latest Hasbro factory in India after facing severe labor shortages and soaring wages at its main factory in southern China. But Musical, like many companies, is running headlong into India\u2019s bureaucratic morass over land purchases, and the project is months behind schedule.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very tough negotiation with the local government,\u201d said Christopher Tse, the managing director of the Musical Group, which for nearly 35 years did almost all its manufacturing in China. \u201cIt takes more time than I expected.\u201dFor Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, the situation presents a political and economic challenge.More than a year ago, Mr. Modi, wearing a traditional bright yellow jacket and standing below an immense logo of a lion, unveiled an ambitious effort to ramp up manufacturing. The \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign promised to reduce bureaucracy and improve infrastructure, paving the way for big multinationals and other foreign investors. It was a cornerstone of his candidacy.Since then, almost nothing has gone as planned.Progress in improving the country\u2019s inadequate roads, rail lines and ports has been slow. Corruption remains pernicious. Urban air pollution is even worse in India than in China, and could deteriorate further as more factories are built.Plans to rewrite labor and land laws, and to overhaul state taxes, have stalled in Parliament. And an effort by Mr. Modi to bypass Parliament with temporary executive orders has run into trouble as well.Mr. Modi\u2019s most controversial but potentially far-reaching executive order \u2014 making it easier to convert farmland into factory sites \u2014 expired on Aug. 31. He chose not to renew it. The ordinance had became a political liability in state elections, as farmers feared that it might be used to push them off their land.\u201cEase of doing business is still a work in progress,\u201d said India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, adding that state governments were starting to reform land and labor laws.Yet slowly and a little unpredictably, India\u2019s manufacturing sector is starting to attract overseas investment.Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer of smartphones and other electronics, which has most of its factories in China, agreed in August to open 10 to 12 plants in western India by 2020, employing as many as 50,000 workers. A week earlier, General Motors announced plans to invest $1 billion to develop new car models for the Indian market and nearly double the size of its seven-year-old factory on the outskirts of Pune.CNH Industrial of Italy is building an agricultural harvester factory nearby. Ford opened a sprawling car assembly plant in northwestern India this year, and Daimler has added an extensive assembly line for buses to its truck factory in southeastern India.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to manufacture a world-class product in India, the economics of exporting are quite lucrative,\u201d said Rustom Desai, the managing director of Corning\u2019s India operations, which include a highly automated optic fiber factory here.Indian officials see manufacturing as essential to their country\u2019s future. They have 10 million young workers a year joining the labor force and few alternatives to create enough jobs.Devendra Fadnavis, an ally of Mr. Modi who is the chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Mumbai and Pune, has been aggressively marketing his state\u2019s huge labor force in trips to China and elsewhere. \u201cWe have the human resources \u2014 if we can liberate them, we can pioneer the industrial production for the entire world,\u201d Mr. Fadnavis said.The pitch has worked. Foreign direct investment in India is up 46 percent over the last two years. It is down 1.3 percent in China, although it shows signs of a modest rebound lately.The recent flood of foreign investment is helping propel India, which is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world this year. The International Monetary Fund estimated this month that India\u2019s economy would increase 7.3 percent in 2015, compared with 6.8 percent this year in China.In many ways, India is benefiting from the challenges facing China.Blue-collar wages in China have more than quintupled in the last decade, and companies face worker shortages despite economic weakness. \u201cIf you want to hire 1,000 workers, you only find 600, and the turnover will be 15 or 20 percent a month,\u201d said Mr. Tse of Musical Group, the Hasbro supplier.By comparison, India offers a stable democracy and low wages. Even skilled factory workers here in Pune, sometimes called the Detroit of India, earn about $300 a month, half of Chinese wages.Maintaining its edge won\u2019t be easy for India.For one, India needs to significantly upgrade its roads, ports and other infrastructure. Musical Group initially considered building a factory about 200 kilometers, or 120 miles outside Kolkata, formerly Calcutta. India\u2019s poor roads meant the trip would take four hours.\u201cIn China, 200 kilometers is two hours,\u201d said Mr. Tse. He ultimately decided to seek costlier land a few miles from the port, only to encounter slow-moving local officials.India is also trying to expand manufacturing just as global trade stalls. A big export push by India could prompt a backlash in other countries, said Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and former chief economic adviser to the Indian government.\u201cTo expect another China to come in without any political reaction would be na\u00efve,\u201d he said in an interview in Mumbai. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a much tougher fight for market share.\u201dWhile many multinationals are enthralled by the potential of the Indian consumer, it may be difficult for the domestic market to absorb a lot of extra production.At least four Chinese smartphone manufacturers \u2014 Huawei, OnePlus, Coolpad and Oppo \u2014 have said they plan to produce handsets in India, while Xiaomi is cooperating with Foxconn to assemble phones in India and Lenovo plans to work with Flextronics. As China\u2019s market approaches saturation, millions of Indians each year are buying smartphones for the first time.But higher-end manufacturers like carmakers are still struggling to break into a market that has yet to create a broad middle class.India\u2019s population has nearly passed China\u2019s. But automakers sell nearly two million cars a month in China, compared with 200,000 a month in India. The best-selling cars in India tend to be very inexpensive subcompacts manufactured by local companies like Maruti, not the larger but costlier models sold by the multinationals.Even among the affluent, \u201csomeone who can afford an Acura will probably buy a Civic,\u201d said Paul Blokland, the director of Segment Y, an automotive research firm based in Goa, India.Millions of Indians are on the cusp of affording cars, although most cannot yet.

{"Headline": "Is There a Silver Lining to Citizens United?", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the absence of caps on contribution amounts \u2014 and with loosened restrictions on sources of political cash \u2014 reformers have been forced to look toward innovative legislation at the city and state level. Those local experiments have led to the development of alternative strategies for financing federal elections that focus on large, publicly funded incentives for the solicitation of small donors.More commonly, corporate and ideological groups \u2014 and their lawyers \u2014 have found new ways to evade, circumnavigate, undermine and finally gut reform legislation.On one hand, candidates may choose to stay within the privately funded campaign structure, raising money from individuals, political action committees and, where permitted, corporations, local businesses and unions.In an interview, Representative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and lead sponsor of The Government by the People Act, described the current post-Citizens United reform strategy as \u201cthe empowerment approach\u201d as opposed to a \u201crules based approach.\u201d\u201cThe thing about money is that it always seems to find a way around the rules,\u201d Sarbanes said. A \u201cpower-based reform\u201d seeks to \u201cmatch power with power\u201d instead.Preliminary indications from states and cities that have matched-funding operations, including New York City, suggest that such programs have the potential to significantly alter politics and policy in three different ways.The first is a shift away from candidate dependence on PACs and other special interest sources and an increase in the amount of money politicians raise from their own constituents.The second effect cited by reformers is the increased likelihood of adoption of legislation generally opposed by business interests, including increases in minimum wage and liberalized family leave policies.Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, warned against drawing firm conclusions from these preliminary examples in a paper, \u201cPublic Election Funding: An Assessment of What We Would Like to Know\u201d:While there are many anecdotal accounts of policy shifts occurring in the wake of clean elections programs, as yet there have not been rigorous studies that have demonstrated significant effects on legislative, regulatory, or other policy outcomes.The third positive consequence cited by advocates of public financing is the election of more working class and moderate income men and women to state legislatures and city councils.I\u2019ve watched as Maine\u2019s Clean Elections system has transformed the state\u2019s Legislature and opened the door for everyday people like plumbers, teachers, carpenters and firefighters to be able to run for office and compete against deep-pocketed or well-connected opponents.The Sarbanes proposal, like much campaign finance legislation at the city and state level, is complex.A candidate for Congress choosing to accept matching money would first have to raise $50,000 from 1,000 small donors who give $150 or less and who live in the candidate\u2019s state.A candidate who reached the $50,000 threshold would be able to start his or her campaign with a kitty of $350,000.Since the Sarbanes bill uses taxpayer money and raises the possibility of shifting legislative bodies to the left, it has zero chance of enactment as long as Republicans control either branch of Congress.Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor and the editor of the recently published book, \u201cSolutions to Political Polarization in America,\u201d observed in an email, \u201cI generally support most public funding programs and support this one as well.\u201dPersily raised the possibility, however, that legislation boosting the role of small donors could increase polarization because there is evidence that such donors are \u201cmore ideologically motivated\u201d than others. To counter the potential of increased polarization, Persily said that public funding could be expanded to \u201ccut very large checks to the political parties to spend as they wish,\u201d since the parties tend to be moderating forces.Steve Rosenthal, a political consultant who used to be political director of the AFL-CIO, is notably enthusiastic about the Sarbanes bill: \u201cAnything that can be done to help level the playing field, so that more everyday Americans can run for office is a good thing,\u201d he said, adding that the median net worth of members of the House and Senate is far above that of voters. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where the only people who can run are those who have contact lists rich enough to raise millions.\u201dHe warned that Congress has become the equivalent of the House of Lords.Bob Bauer, perhaps the preeminent Democratic campaign-finance lawyer, was less enthusiastic. He wrote in an email that the \u201cthe requirement of accepting contributions lower than the lawful limit\u201d serves to impose \u201cin this way an effective spending limit, not characterizing it as such. But it has a \u2018backdoor\u2019 feel to it.\u201dIn terms of winners and losers, Bauer argued that the Sarbanes billis probably to the disadvantage of incumbents and it may also complicate the parties\u2019 inclination to clear fields and subdue insurgencies.Jan Baran, a Republican legal specialist in campaign finance, argued that the matching incentive in the Sarbanes bill amounts topublic financing for the politicians. While taxpayers like tax credits for themselves, they don\u2019t support welfare for political campaigns.another kind of more systemic corruption: the corruption of representation that occurs when candidates spend so much of their time raising campaign money from rich contributors.Malbin, a professor of political science at SUNY-Albany, told the commission:I have nothing against rich contributors, but the system needs broader participation. Surveys make it clear that those who can afford large contributions do not have the same policy interests or priorities as most citizens. When office holders spend so much time hearing from big donors, they get a slanted view of the public\u2019s priorities.For reformers to have a chance requires post-2020 congressional redistricting with Democrats in control in such key states as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, allowing the party to take control of the House in 2022.The Roberts court has deregulated campaign finance on the premise that the only legitimate grounds for restricting money in politics is to prevent explicit corruption. In doing so, however, the court has sanctioned a pervasively corrupt regime.The more central problem of money in politics is something just as troubling but much harder to see: systems in which economic inequalities, inevitable in a free market economy, are transformed into political inequalities that affect both electoral and legislative outcomes. Without any politician taking a single bribe, wealth has an increasingly disproportionate influence on our politics. While we can call that a problem of \u201ccorruption,\u201d this pushes the limits of the words too far (certainly far beyond what the Supreme Court is going to entertain as corruption) and obscures the fundamental unfairness of a political system moving toward plutocracy.The long run solution, Hasen argues \u2014 with reasoning I find unimpeachable \u2014 is a Supreme Court \u201cthat will accept political equality as a compelling interest that justifies reasonable campaign regulations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Passing by in a convoy of S.U.V.s, Alejandro Gillick, a shadowy operator in America\u2019s drug war, does not flinch.\u201cWelcome to Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d he says.But it is yesterday\u2019s hellhole, officials and residents here say \u2014 a place starkly different from the much calmer and safer Ju\u00e1rez of today.The city is beautifying the small colonial center, and painters are freshening up battered houses with coats of violet and lime green. Diggers are plowing empty lots in preparation for construction crews, and the city\u2019s hundreds of factories are crying out for workers.Bars and clubs are buzzing, and expensive cars \u2014 once hidden in garages \u2014 purr at traffic lights. Gone, for the most part, are the days of drug-fueled crime, when people sped home at dusk, businesses were gutted by arson attacks and corpses were a daily spectacle.Which is why some residents here feel so aggrieved at the portrayal of the city in the movie.Enrique Serrano Escobar, the city\u2019s mayor, has urged citizens to boycott the movie and at one point threatened to sue its producers for defamation. The mayor, who has yet to see the film, which is due for release in Mexico in December, even took out ads in some American newspapers, including The New York Times, to express his objections.\u201cThere is a whole community making an effort to restore the image of the city, and now they come along and speak ill of us,\u201d he said in an interview.The movie stars Emily Blunt as a na\u00efve F.B.I. agent who gets involved in a murky operation involving a constellation of American law enforcement officers and Mr. Gillick, played by Benicio Del Toro. In \u201cSicario,\u201d Ju\u00e1rez, a city of about 1.5 million, is a tense, dusty sprawl of graffiti and prowling drug traffickers.But the movie is \u201cout of date,\u201d said Mr. Serrano, and it comes \u201cjust as we in the city are turning in a different direction.\u201dWhy crime in Ju\u00e1rez dropped so quickly is still debated: Officials and experts point to a purge of corrupt police officers and judiciary, better police training, stiffer prison sentences \u2014 including the introduction of life sentences for kidnapping, murder and extortion \u2014 and energetic efforts by community groups. Some experts, though, believe the shift has as much to do with a settlement between the warring Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez cartels.And even as the bloodshed abated in Ju\u00e1rez, it surged elsewhere: The country is still reeling from the disappearance last year of 43 students in a rural town in Guerrero State, and gang violence made the Pacific resort of Acapulco the country\u2019s deadliest city last year.In an email, Denis Villeneuve, the movie\u2019s director, said the film was conceived in 2010 at the height of Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s troubles.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the intention to harm the citizens of Ju\u00e1rez with our movie,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve said. \u201cThe people who are fighting for peace deserve our respect.\u201dBut Mr. Serrano\u2019s outrage has resonated with residents, entrepreneurs, pastors and community organizers, who are anxious to undo the city\u2019s ugly reputation.A few dozen protesters gathered on the bridge between Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, Tex., on Oct. 2 waving placards that declared their love for Ju\u00e1rez and demanding respect.\u201cLook, the movie is tough, but it\u2019s real,\u201d said Salvador Cisneros, a painter and decorator from Ju\u00e1rez who saw the movie last week during a trip to Atlanta. \u201cIn fact, the reality was much worse.\u201dThe turnaround for Ju\u00e1rez began in 2012 and has been significant. Kidnappings have plummeted \u2014 officially there have been none in 20 months \u2014 and the murder rate has fallen from as many as eight a day during the worst times in 2010 to 20 to 30 per month now.Businesses and day-trippers have taken note. Hotels in Ju\u00e1rez have occupancy rates close to 70 percent, up from a low of 20 to 40 percent during the worst violence.Mr. Serrano, the mayor, has teamed with the mayor\u2019s office in El Paso, traveling on joint delegations to cities like Detroit and Chicago to promote investment.But changing a city\u2019s image is a slow process, and business owners and officials worry that \u201cSicario\u201d could stunt the city\u2019s economic prospects.\u201cIf you saw that film in the United States or Europe and you were thinking of coming here, you probably wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d Mr. Serrano said. \u201cIf you were thinking of investing, you probably wouldn\u2019t invest.\u201dSome residents also said they resented the fact the movie was not made in Ju\u00e1rez.The action crosses between Mexico and the United States, but, because of security worries, the producers shot the movie in Albuquerque, El Paso and Mexico City.\u201cAt least they would have created a windfall for the city,\u201d said Liliana P\u00e9rez, an M.B.A. student who started the Ju\u00e1rez Facebook campaign a few months ago.Roberto Herrera, one of the partners in a food court here where diners last week munched tacos and crepes and watched a Star Wars movie on an overhead screen, said it drew many customers from El Paso on weekends and had been so popular that he and his partners were opening another one this month. He fears the movie could put off visitors. \u201cOur fear is that the movie could put people off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201cJu\u00e1rez\u2019s image isn\u2019t important to growth,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cOn the one hand, you have a powerful narrative about Ju\u00e1rez, and people are very sensitive about it,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the other, you have a growing U.S. economy, and that means we have growth.\u201dSergio, who opened a wedding business in 2008, said the mayor\u2019s office should ease business regulations and promote the city effectively rather than fussing about a movie. Case in point, he said: He was fined $250 last year for putting construction rubble in his own front yard and received another fine because a banner on his building exceeded size regulations.\u201cThe role of the government is to bring investment,\u201d said Sergio, who asked that his full name not be used because he has been the target of extortion. \u201cIt\u2019s just a movie.\u201dAnd, he said, \u201clet\u2019s not try to block out the sun with one finger. This city is still problematic.\u201dOld problems surfaced on Oct. 3 when a police commander, Jes\u00fas Eduardo Alem\u00e1n Medina, was gunned down outside his suburban residence. The city was shaken by the killings, that same week, of six women. Though the women died in unconnected circumstances, the cluster of killings raised the specter of the murder of hundreds of young women that gripped the city in the 1990s.For many in Ju\u00e1rez, the bad old days are never far behind. Residents became grim or tearful when they were asked if they believed the city could return to chaos again.The debate about \u201cSicario\u201d has \u201copened up the wound,\u201d said Ms. P\u00e9rez, the M.B.A. student. She said she would probably see the movie out of curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of art,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it hurts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 57-Year-Old Chart That Is Dividing the Fed", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyNext week, when Federal Reserve officials meet to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years, one question will be front and center: How much faith should be placed in a line on a graph first drawn by a New Zealand economist nearly six decades ago, based on data on wages and employment in Britain dating to the 1860s?That would be the Phillips curve, one of the most important concepts in macroeconomics. It shows how inflation changes when unemployment changes and vice versa. The intuition is simple: When joblessness is low, employers have to pay ever higher wages to attract workers, which feeds through into higher prices more broadly. And inflation is particularly prone to rise when the unemployment rate falls below the \u201cnatural rate\u201d at which pretty much everybody who wants a job either has one or can find one quickly.Except it doesn\u2019t work. Or at least, it hasn\u2019t worked very well in the last few decades in the United States. And it has proved particularly problematic to try to use that historical relationship to predict where inflation is going.That is why a longstanding academic debate is now at the core of the Fed\u2019s policy debate. Ms. Yellen and many of her Fed colleagues have indicated that they think they should raise interest rates this year, in part because the Phillips curve suggests there will be excessive inflation if they don\u2019t. The unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in September, just a smidgen above the 4.9 percent that Fed leaders believe is the appropriate jobless rate in the longer run.In other words, if you believe in the traditional Phillips curve, inflation should be taking off any day now.It\u2019s only a slight exaggeration to say that the Fed\u2019s rate decision this year will be based on whether its leaders really believe that the Phillips curve is useful in describing how the economy works in 2015.The most crude versions of the Phillips curve have indeed, in recent decades at least, been nearly useless. Any attempt to estimate it requires a researcher to decide what measure of employment to use, what measure of inflation and what time lags to assume, among other choices. So there are nearly as many versions of the Phillips curve as there are researchers who study it.If you simply look at the unemployment rate in the United States versus the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices for every year since 1958, there is nearly no statistical relationship at all, just a jumble of dots. (A best-fit line actually points the wrong direction, correlating higher unemployment with higher inflation, albeit very weakly.)After all, if the relationship between unemployment and inflation is constantly shifting, for reasons that are impossible to predict, it isn\u2019t a particularly useful tool for deciding what policy should be today.That said, a generation or two of economists have been working to understand what those simplistic versions of the Phillips curve get wrong, and have created more complex versions that incorporate more variables and might prove useful at predictions.In particular, after the combination of high inflation and high unemployment of the 1970s \u2014 a condition that would be impossible in a world in which the Phillips curve worked perfectly \u2014 scholars began adding inflation expectations to their models to help explain the paradox.In other words, just knowing the unemployment rate may tell you very little about what inflation will be. But if you add a few more variables, you can do a better job at predictions.\u201cIf you do it right, the Phillips curve relationship has been very stable over the last 40 years,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s the old ocean liner analogy \u2014 it takes a long time to turn an ocean liner, and it takes a long time for the inflation rate to respond to high unemployment or low unemployment.\u201dAn important implication of Mr. Gordon\u2019s model is that much of the inflation rate in 2016 or even 2020 is decided by economic shifts that have already happened (recent productivity levels, for example) or by factors that policy makers have little control over (like what happens to oil prices).His model predicts that if unemployment levels keep falling the way they have recently, inflation won\u2019t reach the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target until 2020. Mr. Gordon doubts that whether the central bank raises interest rates this week or in December or six months from now will make much difference to that outcome.In a way, the debate over how much faith the Fed puts in the Phillips curve shows the broader dilemma of economic policy. For all the researchers over the decades and centuries who have tried to understand how the economy really works and to predict its course with precision, our ability to know where the economy is heading next year is no better than the ability of weather forecasters to predict whether it will rain three weeks from today. The United States economy is, after all, determined largely by the endlessly complicated interactions of 320 million people producing $17 trillion worth of stuff, which even relatively complex models can\u2019t keep up with.There\u2019s a difference, though, between economic forecasting and weather forecasting. People don\u2019t have any short-term influence over the weather, but central banks and other economic policy makers do have influence over the short-term course of the economy. So for all its faults, the Phillips curve \u2014 particularly its more sophisticated varieties \u2014 may be the best tool that Janet Yellen and company have to work with.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Policy Makers Skeptical on Preventing Financial Crisis", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The 2008 financial crisis convinced most people in the world of central banking that it would be a good idea to try to prevent that kind of thing from happening again.Crises remain hard to anticipate and prevent, and the available tools could cause significant economic damage.\u201cMy own view is that while the use of macroprudential tools holds promise, we are a long way from being able to successfully use such tools in the United States,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told the conference.In the meantime, the importance of prevention has only increased because the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to the outbreak of a crisis has diminished. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act prevents the Fed from repeating some aspects of its 2008 actions. More important, the Fed expects interest rates to remain below historic norms for the foreseeable future, leaving less room to cut rates, which has long been its first line of defense.Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman, said he was troubled by the gap between perception and reality. \u201cIf you ask people who is responsible for financial stability they would say, \u2018The Fed,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Kohn, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut the Fed doesn\u2019t really have the instruments. It doesn\u2019t really have the tools.\u201cAnd I think this is a dangerous situation if people perceive that it has the responsibility and it doesn\u2019t have the tools.\u201dThe obvious reason to prevent bubbles is that crises are bad for the economy. Seven years after the peak of the 2008 crisis, the Fed still has not been able to drive unemployment or inflation back to normal levels. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 percent \u2014 a level usually associated in the past with a robust economy \u2014 but that figure overstates the current health of the labor market.Prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.3 percent in the 12-month period ending in August, far below the 2 percent level the Fed would like to achieve to support healthy spending and investment.So popping bubbles probably means curtailing some beneficial booms, too.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make a choice about how much growth we are willing to give up in good times to limit the likelihood of a future financial crisis,\u201d said Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.Other officials and experts also share Mr. Dudley\u2019s doubts about the Fed\u2019s power to pop bubbles. American regulators have fewer tools than some of their European counterparts, and those tools are distributed among a number of agencies that have little history of cooperating either quickly or effectively.\u201cThe current U.S. institutional setup is likely to fail in a crisis and will do less to prevent a crisis than it should,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cAnd we are likely to suffer from this.\u201dFrederic S. Mishkin, a former Fed governor, noted that financial firms tend to resist increased regulation, often with considerable success. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hire a lot of lawyers to figure out how to get around these regulations and undermine them,\u201d Mr. Mishkin, a Columbia University economist, said.These constraints on the Fed\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to problems as they are developing has led officials to emphasize measures that strengthen the resilience of the financial system. A prominent example: stricter limits on banks\u2019 reliance on borrowed money. Mr. Dudley said progress in this area should provide \u201cconsiderable solace\u201d to those worried about the slow progress of macroprudential regulation.Some officials, however, argue that a more drastic shift may be necessary. They want the Fed to use its most powerful tool \u2014 raising and lowering interest rates \u2014 to help maintain the stability of financial markets.The Fed might curb speculative excesses by raising interest rates. Similarly, it could soothe fragile financial markets by holding rates steady, as it is doing now, or by cutting rates, as it does during downturns.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.But Ms. Yellen\u2019s deputy, the Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer, said on Friday at the Boston conference that the use of monetary policy for such goals deserves consideration. \u201cThere may be times when adjustments to monetary policy should be discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability,\u201d he said.Others, however, said it was not clear that raising rates was a more effective means of addressing risks to the financial system than sensible regulation.\u201cI\u2019m a skeptic,\u201d Mr. Kohn, of Brookings, said. \u201cI think that monetary policy, changes in interest rates, are likely to be not very effective in damping a lot of these cycles.\u201dThe current discussion is largely framed by the details of the last crisis. Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University, said he saw little reason to think the Fed could have curbed the rise of housing prices in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis by raising interest rates more quickly. He noted that Britain had higher rates than the United States and just as severe a housing bubble.Instead, Mr. Gertler said, \u201cWe can certainly imagine that some kind of restrictions on the subprime market might have been a more effective way to contain this mess.\u201dNellie Liang, director of the Fed\u2019s office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, presented a study showing that changes in interest rates have a limited effect on credit booms in the early stages, and then even that fades away. That suggested that macroprudential measures had a role to play.But the skeptics held sway.Luc Laeven, director general for research at the European Central Bank, provided a fitting, if disheartening, summary of the conference.\u201cBoth monetary policy and macroprudential policy are not really very effective,\u201d Mr. Laeven said.He added a plaintive question. \u201cDo we have other policies?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poland\u2019s Swing Toward the Right", "Date": "2015-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSince they broke free of the Kremlin more than two decades ago, Eastern and central European states have all swung widely in their political choices as they have navigated the uncharted transition from imposed authoritarian regimes to democracy and a free market. The Poles in Sundays voting evidently felt it was time for a more familiar mix of conservative Catholic values and a broader social safety net. They clearly responded to promises of more welfare spending on the poor, a lower retirement age and higher taxes on banks.Mr. Kaczynski and his identical twin, the late President Lech Kaczynski, had a tumultuous earlier run in power, when much of their appeal was in xenophobic politics similar to those of Hungary\u2019s bombastic prime minister, Viktor Orban, whom Jaroslaw Kaczynski openly admires. Aware that many Poles are wary of that approach, he appointed a mild-mannered party stalwart, Beata Szydlo, as the formal standard-bearer, and she will now take over from Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz. Mr. Kaczynski, however, will be the real power behind the throne.After eight years in power, the pro-European Union Civic Platform party had come to appear elitist and haughty to the public. And while the economy has expanded by an impressive 50 percent over the past decade, Polish voters \u2014 like many other Eastern and central Europeans \u2014 have come to judge their standard of living against that of Western Europe, which remains far ahead.While more social spending could slow growth, Mr. Kaczynski is not likely to carry out all his campaign pledges, and Poland\u2019s economic base is strong. On foreign policy, Law and Justice holds hard-line positions against further European Union integration, ceding more powers to Brussels or taking in immigrants, and it is strongly wary of Russia. The departing government also resisted accepting immigrants, and whatever Poles may think of Brussels, they are also keenly aware of the benefits of the European Union\u2019s freedom of movement for the millions of Polish citizens who work elsewhere in Europe.There is little to celebrate in the election of a government that is more nationalistic and anti-Europe than the previous one. Poland has made remarkable progress in 26 years, and it would do itself great harm if it turned back now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal, Which Built a Chinese City, Now Threatens to Bury It", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFushun JournalFUSHUN, China \u2014 The descent into the pit was steep, and the car skidded down a bumpy serpentine road.\u201cThe road is supposed to be smooth, but last night\u2019s storm and the following landslides make it so rough,\u201d said Cui Yuan, 44, who as the head of the Fushun Geological and Environmental Monitoring Station is in charge of monitoring the landslides, which leave the road littered with coal byproduct.Toward the bottom of the pit, a decrepit four-story building slanted at a dangerous angle. Half of the tall, thin pillars supporting the conveyor belts that transport coal to the surface were tilted precariously.The few miners at Fushun\u2019s West Open Mine, the largest open coal mine in Asia, were not mining coal but clearing roads blocked by landslides and putting out coal fires, which erupt spontaneously when buried coal is exposed to air for the first time in millions of years.As miners scrape out the last layers of minable coal, buildings near the mine have been abandoned and the city\u2019s underground water pipes are cracking.Today, Fushun produces less than three million tons of coal a year, a drop from a peak of 18.3 million tons in 1962. All five main coal mines here could close by 2030, Mr. Cui said.At the bottom of the West Open Mine, a 4.2-square-mile pit some 1,000 feet below the surface, coal glistened in the sun. \u201cWe are at the lowest point in China,\u201d Mr. Cui said. \u201cWe have another 60-meter layer right beneath our feet, but there\u2019s no way we can dig further.\u201dDigging deeper would cause more landslides and more damage that the city is ill equipped to handle.When the Japanese occupied the region in the early 20th century, they refilled the pits as they mined to prevent landslides.\u201cBut after Chairman Mao came, the open mine only got bigger and bigger,\u201d said Zhang Jun, 52, former head of the project department at Fushun\u2019s Development and Reform Commission, the local agency that oversees economic development. \u201cSince the 1980s, we have been in what I call a \u2018savage mode\u2019 of mining.\u201dThe state-owned mining companies cut dangerously steep angles into the ground without refilling, a practice that has put Fushun\u2019s future at risk, he said. Landslides now threaten 42.5 percent of Fushun\u2019s urban areas, according to a 2012 government report.The city has begun refilling part of the West Open Mine with soil from another active mine, the East Open Mine, but it may come as too little too late.The damage already done at the West Open Mine is evident. Walking past a sign that warned \u201cGeological Disaster Danger Zone: Do Not Enter,\u201d Mr. Cui pointed to two empty, destroyed buildings about 70 feet below him. \u201cThose sank a few years ago, and it sometimes sinks as many as 20 centimeters a day,\u201d or about eight inches, he said.Just south of the mine, groups of bungalows are half immersed in water. Abandoned factories, shut down because of falling coal production and sinking ground, silently testify to the consequences of unsustainable development.Also sinking is the city\u2019s \u201cvegetable basket,\u201d once the city\u2019s main farming area, some 13,000 acres of once-arable land. Now, 5,500 acres are completely useless, Mr. Zhang said.Rows of new apartment buildings have replaced the infamous Fushun shantytown, where miners and their families had lived for decades. One of several relocation projects, it had, by the end of 2014, taken in 413,300 former shantytown residents.But the displaced workers have other concerns.\u201cWe don\u2019t receive much help finding new jobs, and the old factories don\u2019t have funds to rebuild,\u201d said one woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. She had recently moved with her family, mostly factory workers, from a landslide zone to a new apartment.Although Fushun\u2019s coal was discovered centuries ago, it was not exploited on a mass scale until 1901, during the Qing dynasty. Fushun was near the hometown of the early Qing emperors, and upsetting the land of royal ancestors was considered taboo.Japan joined the coal rush in 1903, first by renting land and then, in 1931, by seizing it. According to an exhibit at the Fushun Coal Mine Museum, Japan mined 223 million tons of coal here at the expense of nearly 300,000 casualties among Chinese miners before the end of World War II.\u201cBut it was the Japanese who laid the industrial foundation for Fushun, and Fushun became a city built around coal mines,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.Later, under Communist rule, Fushun became a pillar of the Chinese economy, a leading center for not only coal but also the production of aluminum, steel and excavation machinery.Fushun\u2019s decline began in the 1980s, when China\u2019s economic liberalization drive no longer favored heavy industry. Now, mired in a chronic economic slowdown like much of the rest of the country\u2019s industrial northeast, Fushun is grappling with the slow death of the coal mining industry.\u201cWithout reform, the city waits for its doom,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cWith the wrong reforms, the city may be asking to be doomed.\u201dMr. Zhang has helped draft plans to shift the city\u2019s economy away from its dependence on coal and heavy industry, but progress has been limited because of the enormous costs, which the city can ill afford.In the long run, Fushun aims to become a consumption-based economy, he said, but given the wave of factory shutdowns, worsening job market, decreasing birthrate and declining population, that transition may not happen soon.Fortunately, besides fossil fuel, Fushun has 70 percent forest coverage and rich water resources. In recent years, the city has taken on infrastructure projects outside the industrial center and revived the landscape along the Hun River, which runs through the city.\u201cWhen people first started exploiting the mines, no one thought about what the future would be,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cWith some luck, if we explore a healthy development approach, Fushun will become a beautiful city along a river, what we call \u2018Budapest of the East.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Will End Kirchner\u2019s Presidency, Not Her Hold on Argentina", "Date": "2015-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Her party\u2019s candidate is widely seen as the front-runner. One of her closest aides is his running mate. Her son and her economy minister are running for Congress, too. And if they don\u2019t win, a new law prevents whoever replaces her from undoing one of her signature economic policies.But while Mrs. Kirchner, 62, is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, she is not going quietly. After emerging as one of Argentina\u2019s strongest leaders in decades, she has sought to assert her lasting sway with a range of calculated moves in recent months.Daniel Scioli, the candidate endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner, speaks about a continuity with her policies, while suggesting a few important tweaks, like improving strained ties with the United States and Argentina\u2019s creditors.Adding to the message that her course will be maintained, Carlos Zannini, her legal secretary, who is believed to be one of her closest advisers, was picked to be Mr. Scioli\u2019s vice-presidential running mate.Mrs. Kirchner also pushed through a new law that would require congressional approval to sell state-owned stakes in companies, chiefly a portfolio acquired when she nationalized pension funds in 2008. Axel Kicillof, her economy minister, said the measure would ensure that any effort to privatize such holdings in the future would not be a \u201cunilateral decision by the executive branch,\u201d making it much harder to undo some of her most contentious decisions. Mrs. Kirchner herself proudly said that \u201cnobody\u2019s pen will now be enough\u201d to dilute the role of the state. People in her government contend that her influence is here to stay. With his three-day beard, abhorrence for neckties and an office stacked high with tomes on political philosophy, Ricardo Forster fits right into the high echelons of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s leftist government. He even has the lofty job title to prove it: secretary for strategic coordination of national thought.\u201cThere\u2019s something hazy about the figure of Scioli,\u201d Ms. Rib\u00e9 continued, explaining that she was concerned he could veer too far from Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s leftist path. \u201cHe might sink us into the mud,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if Cristina is going to put a revolver against his head so that he does everything to the letter.\u201dArgentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.Mr. Scioli served as Nestor Kirchner\u2019s vice president from 2003 to 2007, but as governor of Buenos Aires Province he has sometimes been at odds with Mrs. Kirchner and her supporters, who have viewed him as too close to corporate interests.\u201cHis conflict with Cristina is inevitable,\u201d said Rosendo Fraga, an Argentine political analyst, reflecting a preference here for using Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s first name. He noted the expectation that she could try to run for president again in 2019, an ambition that could put her on a collision course with Mr. Scioli.\u201cIf Scioli wins,\u201d Mr. Fraga said, \u201cthis will be the most important political conflict of the next period, something that is already being insinuated.\u201dLooking forward to the end of a long stretch in which Mrs. Kirchner relished clashing with opponents in the news media and the business establishment, some Argentines cannot wait for the president and her polarizing style of governing to leave office.\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that could happen to us,\u201d said Juan Addesi, 52, a watch repairman. Mr. Addesi, who plans to vote for Nicol\u00e1s del Ca\u00f1o, a socialist, said he was angry that his business had been hindered by import restrictions that make it difficult to obtain spare parts. \u201cI could be 10 times better off,\u201d he said.Others question how Mrs. Kirchner, whose personal wealth has grown over the past decade, according to her sworn declarations, will handle claims of corruption once she leaves office.She is under investigation over accusations that a family hotel business in Patagonia was used to launder money. A businessman with close ties to the Kirchners has been accused of paying for block reservations through his companies, but the rooms appeared to have never been occupied. Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s chief of staff said the investigation had become a defamation campaign against her.Still, Mrs. Kirchner is trying to project her sway beyond the elections, which could go to a second round if no candidate wins outright on Sunday.\u201cShe\u2019s trying to assert the foreign policy of the next administration,\u201d Mr. Finchelstein said. \u201cBut if history prevails, there will be an exodus to the new president. After all, he\u2019s the one who controls the purse strings and effectively signs the checks from the executive branch.\u201dMrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters say that much depends on the paths pursued by the president and her successor.\u201cShe\u2019s not going to interfere in any decision that Scioli takes,\u201d said Mr. Forster, the secretary of national thought. Then he qualified that statement, adding, \u201cunless there\u2019s a dramatic shift in what this political project has consisted of until now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle, in Midst of Tech Boom, Tries to Keep Its Soul", "Date": "2015-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For years, business leaders here have closely studied the San Francisco region, seeking to emulate the way it churns out so many leading technology companies.In large measure, those efforts worked. But now, leaders in Seattle are looking to the Bay Area as a different sort of model: a cautionary tale.While many cities would do almost anything for a deluge of high-tech jobs, others are grappling with the side effects that often accompany surging economies. A plan by Google to expand its presence in Boulder, Colo., with a new campus last year ignited a debate over home prices and traffic. Residents of Portland, Ore., are pointing fingers at people moving from the Bay Area, blaming them for soaring home prices.And in Austin, Tex., whose official motto is \u201clive music capital of the world,\u201d a charity called Black Fret is awarding grants to musicians struggling with the rising cost of living in the city. Matt Ott, a marketing executive at a tech start-up in Austin, who co-founded Black Fret, left the Bay Area about a decade ago because it got so expensive.\u201cIt got really tiring to have wealth and consumption be the topic of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is a real danger here.\u201dNowhere, though, has there been a more concerted effort to create a San Francisco-like tech scene with fewer downsides than in Seattle, the country\u2019s second-biggest tech hub by some measures.Beyond Amazon and Microsoft, Seattle\u2019s tech scene in the last 10 years has come to include dozens of smaller tech companies as well as engineering offices for Facebook, Google and other Bay Area tech giants. The number of technology-related jobs in King County, which includes Seattle and neighboring cities, jumped to almost 138,000 this year, from about 88,000 in 2005, according to Community Attributes, a research firm, and the Washington Technology Industry Association.While the city\u2019s mayor, Ed Murray, praises Amazon, he has also said he wants to keep the working-class roots of Seattle, a city with a major port, fishing fleet and even a steel mill. After taking office last year, he made the minimum-wage increase a priority and reassured representatives of the city\u2019s manufacturing and maritime industries that Seattle needed them.\u201cIt\u2019s not true that a strong technology sector in Seattle means the demise of manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Murray said in a speech last year.A rising economy often leads to rising living costs, and to help slow the increase, Mr. Murray has pushed housing construction. He has set a goal of creating 50,000 homes \u2014 40 percent of them affordable for low-income residents \u2014 over the next decade.\u201cWe can hopefully create enough affordable housing so we don\u2019t find ourselves as skewed by who lives in the city as San Francisco is,\u201d Mr. Murray said.The plan is something of a repudiation of the policies in San Francisco, which has a notoriously complex building approval process, and where efforts to construct high-density housing often encounter ferocious resistance from neighbors.The debate over affordable housing in San Francisco has intensified in the last few years as the tech frenzy migrated to the city, once a backwater for start-ups, from Silicon Valley. Corporate buses that shuttle San Francisco-dwelling employees down the peninsula have been the targets of activists protesting gentrification.And the San Francisco area remains a strong magnet for the tech-inclined.\u201cAt an individual level, I wish Seattle were more like S.F., simply because it\u2019s way easier to find interesting work in S.F.\u201d for tech engineers, said John Rauser, who had worked in San Francisco for Pinterest, a digital scrapbooking site. He recently moved to Seattle, thinking it would be easier to raise a family.Yet Alan Durning, a member of the committee that put together Seattle\u2019s housing plan, said that the Bay Area\u2019s affordable housing crisis was a central part of the group\u2019s discussions, and that the area embodied the kind of situation most members desperately wanted to avoid.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to be a thriving tech center \u2014 we do,\u201d Mr. Durning said. \u201cIt\u2019s that the San Francisco and Silicon Valley communities have gotten themselves into a trap where preservationists and local politics have basically guaranteed buying a house will cost at least $1 million. Already in Seattle, it costs half-a-million, so we\u2019re well on our way.\u201dMuch of the building boom here so far has been for apartments with high rents, geared toward tech workers. The city\u2019s vibrant Capitol Hill neighborhood has been a point of contention, with some residents being priced out of the area. The streets and freeways are increasingly choked with traffic, and locals often denounce the public transportation options.John Criscitello, an artist, has pasted posters throughout Capitol Hill protesting the changes brought by the newcomers. \u201cWelcome! Rich Kids,\u201d one poster reads, while another declares, \u201cWish you weren\u2019t here.\u201dThose feelings have been expressed in places like Portland as well, where a two-bedroom house is half the price of a studio apartment in San Francisco.Roger Valdez, director of Smart Growth Seattle, a group that advocates high-density housing and is supported by developers, has been disappointed at the resistance to more development in the city.\u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d he said. \u201cOne path leads to San Francisco, where you have an incredibly regulated and stagnant housing economy that can\u2019t keep up with demand. The other path is something different, the Seattle way.\u201dAn article on Friday about Seattle\u2019s efforts to nurture a tech boom while avoiding the downsides it sees in San Francisco, like surging home prices and a waning diversity, described incorrectly the cost of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. \u201cMore than $3,500\u201d (actually $3,530) is the median rent, not the standard rent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Engine-Rigging Scheme Said to Have Begun in 2008", "Date": "2015-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRather than stop production of the engine and throw out years of work and investment, managers decided to cheat, the people said, confirming a report in Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper. They did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.It remained unclear who was responsible for the decision, which has created a crisis at the world\u2019s largest automaker. The deception will force the company to undertake costly repairs on as many as 11 million affected vehicles and has tarnished Germany\u2019s image as a bastion of engineering prowess.In late September, Volkswagen suspended three top managers who played prominent roles in engine development, but the carmaker has not publicly disclosed the reasons for the suspensions.\u201cWe are working intensively to clarify what occurred,\u201d a company spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThoroughness comes before speed. We will provide information as soon as we have facts.\u201dVolkswagen is expected to disclose some of the findings from its internal inquiry this week. By showing that it is aggressively investigating what led to the fraud, the company may be seeking to limit further damage to its reputation and future car sales.After interviewing engineers who participate in engine development, internal auditors have determined that the illegal software was installed beginning in 2008, according to the people familiar with the inquiry, which is still at a preliminary stage.By then, Volkswagen had spent several years developing a new diesel engine line, known as the EA 189, which included both 1.6- and 2.0-liter versions, and was preparing for production. The EA 189 was one of the most important engines in the company, destined not only for millions of Volkswagen-brand cars but also for a wide variety of other brands from the parent Volkswagen Group, like Audi, Skoda and Seat, as well as some light utility vehicles.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Significantly, the engines were also scheduled to be used in Golf, Passat, Beetle and Jetta models that were to be sold in the United States as part of a push to market \u201cclean diesel\u201d \u2014 a concept promoted as a way for drivers to be environmentally responsible while enjoying high fuel economy and peppy performance.But according to the internal inquiry, the engines proved unable to live up to that standard and meet air-quality emissions standards. Volkswagen\u2019s big bet on the future was poised to fail.It was not yet clear how many countries\u2019 emissions standards the new motor would have been able to meet without cheating. But the United States, with its limits on diesel emissions that are much stricter than those of the European Union, was one of the most important.Cars from the 2009 model year were the first to arrive in the United States with the new motors. By that point, it would have been a severe setback to cancel production and go back to the drawing board.It remained unclear who made the decision to solve the emissions problem by installing software deliberately devised to cheat on emissions tests. The software could recognize when a car was undergoing emissions tests and set temporary pollution controls so that the vehicle would pass. During normal operation, the cars could emit as much as 40 times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxides, a class of harmful pollutants.The recently suspended managers were all people in central decision-making roles. They are Ulrich Hackenberg, head of development for all Volkswagen Group brands, and previously head of development for Volkswagen-brand cars from 2007 to 2013; Heinz-Jakob Neusser, currently head of development for the Volkswagen brand; and Wolfgang Hatz, head of engines and transmissions development for all Volkswagen brands.The three suspended executives could not be reached for comment.A few years before discovering that the EA 189 engines could not satisfy pollution regulations, Volkswagen made a fateful decision not to use a more expensive diesel-emissions technology developed jointly with its rival Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars. Instead, in 2007 Volkswagen announced that it would use its own method for controlling emissions of nitrogen oxides and other harmful pollutants. That system, when used on the EA 189 engines, proved inadequate for the task.Even if no top executives ordered the use of the illegal software or knew about it, the latest revelations are likely to reinforce criticism of the company\u2019s high-pressure management methods.Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen who resigned last month, was known for setting extremely ambitious goals. In 2008, for instance, as the company\u2019s hopes were riding on the rollout of the EA 189 engine, he vowed to triple sales in the United States within a decade. Mr. Winterkorn, who has denied knowledge of the illegal software, also had a reputation for dealing harshly with subordinates who failed to meet their targets.In Germany, where Volkswagen is the largest company by sales, the scandal has raised fears that there could be collateral damage to other carmakers and to the country\u2019s reputation for excellence in engineering.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, sought to calm those fears in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the reputation of German business, the trust in German business, is so badly shaken that we no longer qualify as a good place to do business,\u201d she said.In the United States, almost all of the approximately 500,000 cars that are affected are Volkswagen-brand cars like the Passat, Golf, Jetta and Beetle that have two-liter diesel motors. About 14,000 Audi A3 diesels, beginning with the 2010 model year, are also affected, the company has said.Analysts warn that the effect on Volkswagen\u2019s financial health could be far-reaching, easily exceeding the 6.5 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion, that the company has set aside so far to cover costs from the scandal.Volkswagen will be forced to spend huge sums defending itself against a growing number of lawsuits by shareholders and disgruntled owners, as well as official investigations in the United States and other countries. And the company\u2019s credit rating could suffer, which would raise the cost for the company to borrow money.Analysts at Fitch Ratings said last week that the crisis could even affect the ability of Volkswagen\u2019s finance unit to package car loans into securities that could be sold to investors. Investors might demand a higher interest rate if they believe that the vehicles used to secure the loans may lose value.Although Volkswagen is profitable and has a large cash buffer, those costs could divert resources needed to develop new vehicles, which could eventually force the company to sell assets such as its truck-making units.Many components of the two-liter motors came from Bosch, a company based in Stuttgart, Germany, while Continental, based in Hanover, Germany, supplied parts for 1.6-liter diesels. Both companies said it was up to Volkswagen to configure software used to manage engine functions.\u201cSoftware we delivered cannot be used to manipulate emissions test results,\u201d Continental said in a statement Sunday. The company provided fuel injectors, fuel pumps and equipment to manage the motor, but Volkswagen provided the specifications and was responsible for installing and configuring the software, Continental said.Volkswagen has said it will unveil a technical solution for the affected vehicles on Wednesday, when the company\u2019s supervisory board is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting. But experts are skeptical that Volkswagen can find a way to make cars compliant without hurting fuel economy and performance.\u201cIf they could have passed without cheating, they would have done so,\u201d Emmanuel Bulle, an auto analyst at Fitch Ratings, said during a conference call with customers on Friday.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Victims of the Volkswagen Scandal: Dealers", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd it is happening at a delicate time for Volkswagen and its 650 dealers in the United States, where sales have slumped in recent years while the domestic car market rebounded.For several years, American dealers complained to Volkswagen that it was offering the wrong cars for the domestic market and that its prices were too high compared with its rivals.But the appointment last year of a new German top executive in the United States, along with a major commitment to build a new sport utility vehicle for the American market by next year, had raised hope among dealers that they could turn their fortunes around.Instead, the dealers are on the front line of a controversy that has tarnished the carmaker\u2019s reputation and could undermine sales. It is a new strain in what was already a tense relationship between dealers and the parent company.\u201cThe recent events unfolding globally regarding the diesel scandal has hit the dealers in the U.S. extremely hard,\u201d said Alan Brown, who is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council and runs two Volkswagen dealerships in Texas. \u201cWe have been suffering from an outdated product cycle, overpriced product and a deteriorating relationship between the dealer body and Volkswagen for a number of years.\u201dFor now, dealers must manage the expectations of angry car owners harmed by Volkswagen\u2019s deception while engineers at the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, figure out how to fix the diesel cars so they comply with emissions standards while still retaining performance and fuel economy.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Volkswagen revealed last week that it had sold 11 million diesel cars with software that lowered pollution levels during emissions testing. Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, said he expected to have a remedy submitted to regulators in the next few days.About 482,000 of those cars equipped with the cheating system were sold in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Those will have to be recalled and fixed. Car dealers are also stuck with hundreds of diesel-engine cars on their lots that they can no longer sell until Volkswagen fixes the emission problem.\u201cWe are sitting here doing the best we can, and we\u2019re waiting patiently along with the rest of our customers to see what Volkswagen decides to do,\u201d said Lance Willis, the general manager of a Volkswagen dealership in the Woodlands, Tex.Three days after admitting to its deception, Volkswagen told its dealers that it would provide financial guarantees and extra bonuses to \u201cstabilize your profitability in the near term.\u201dIt also stressed in another dealer communication that the problem did not affect the safety of its vehicles and that the company was working hard to find a solution, a message it has since posted on its public social platforms.\u201cWe understand the pressure these recent events have put your business under, and we are committed to providing you support,\u201d the letter said, which was signed by Michael Horn, the chief executive of the Volkswagen Group of America.As part of its financial support, Volkswagen said it would offer to reimburse dealers for the cost of holding on to diesel cars affected by the sale freeze until repair instructions were released. The company will also pay dealers $300 for any new gasoline-powered car they sell, $600 for Passat models and will guarantee extra bonus compensations for dealers for cars sold in the third and fourth quarter this year.Relations between Volkswagen and its dealers have been increasingly tense in recent years. Until Mr. Horn was appointed in 2014, dealers complained that their voices were not being heard by the company\u2019s leadership in Germany. They warned that the overly ambitious goal of selling 800,000 cars by 2018 would not be met and said the company\u2019s lineup needed cars that were better adapted to the American market.Partly in response to those concerns, Volkswagen said last year that it would produce at its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., a new midsize sport utility vehicle targeted at American consumers. The new vehicle is expected to be ready by 2016, part of a $600 million investment in its sole American manufacturing plant.The plan was a signal that Volkswagen\u2019s slump in the United States had finally caught the attention of its top managers.Volkswagen became the largest carmaker in the world when its sales surpassed those of Toyota last year. But in the United States, the company ranks at No. 10, far behind market leaders like General Motors, Ford and Toyota, and also trailing Kia, Hyundai and Subaru.Through August, the company sold 238,000 cars in the United States this year, down about 3 percent in the period last year. By contrast, General Motors had sold more than two million cars since the beginning of the year, and its sales rose 3 percent. Volkswagen sales in the United States accounted for just 6 percent of the 9.5 million cars it sold around the world last year.Despite the scandal, dealers have praised Mr. Horn\u2019s leadership, saying he had repaired the trust between dealers and Volkswagen. Mr. Brown, of the Dealer Advisory Council, added that unless Mr. Horn was directly implicated in the fraud, his removal as the top American executive \u201cwould be nothing short of catastrophic to our market and our relationship.\u201d (The company said last week it would keep Mr. Horn as the head of its business in the United States. On Tuesday, the company named a company veteran, Winfried Vahland, the chief executive of Skoda, a Czech subsidiary, to a new board-level position overseeing all of its North American operations.)Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said the company was working with its dealers to address their immediate needs. \u201cDealer and customer satisfaction is a top priority for Volkswagen,\u201d she said.There is no playbook for how to move forward for Volkswagen. While recalls are common, they generally involve a safety problem that must be addressed, not a ploy to foil regulators.\u201cVolkswagen\u2019s acknowledged misconduct regarding its vehicle emissions has been extremely disappointing, and dealers are deeply concerned about how this breach of trust will affect their customers,\u201d said Jared Allen, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association.Steve Wilhite, a former marketing executive at Volkswagen in the 1990s, said the company needed to take quick steps to protect dealers. He suggested that the company should offer to buy back diesel-power cars from customers at the full retail value before news of the diesel scandal broke and then sell them back to dealers at a discount to their wholesale value.\u201cThis was just an unbelievably stupid, arrogant series of decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the dealers are going to take a beating.

Tunisia, however, has seen a democratic transition based on a vibrant civil society, with demands for respect for basic human rights.\u201dIn Tunisia, the winners rejoiced. \u201cCongratulations to Tunisia, to the quartet and to all parties that facilitated the mission of the quartet,\u201d the labor union\u2019s secretary general, Houcine Abassi, told Radio Mosa\u00efque FM. \u201cThis prize came at the right time, because our country is still threatened by different security challenges.\u201dThe president of the Human Rights League, Abdessattar Ben Moussa, told the radio station, \u201cIt proves that dialogue is the only way to solve a crisis and not weapons.\u201dAn Islamist party, Ennahda, won the most votes the next year in Tunisia\u2019s first free parliamentary elections, but its proposal for a new constitution that would weaken women\u2019s status as equal to men, among other changes, drew widespread protests. The assassination of two opposition politicians in 2013 led to calls for the Ennahda-led government to step down, and by the end of the year it had agreed to a timetable for a democratic transition, becoming the only Islamist-led government created during the Arab Spring to cede power willingly.The quartet was successful because it represented a credible third party that could guarantee the agreement. Having seen the Muslim Brotherhood government deposed in Egypt, Tunisia\u2019s Islamists feared a similar fate. Although the Islamists did not trust their political opponents, they reportedly did trust Mr. Abassi, the union leader.Past Nobel Prizes have led to controversy, intrigue and, at times, serious second-guessing. Test your knowledge of the prizes.Participants have commented that Tunisia was lucky in that no single group in the country was strong enough to consider enforcing its own hegemony. Unlike in Egypt, the Tunisian Army \u2014 always kept weak under Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s dictatorship \u2014 was not in a position to take power. Nor could members of the former government, or its more democratic opponents, overthrow the Islamist-led government.In Oslo, Ms. Five said that the 2013 achievement was decisive in the Nobel committee\u2019s thinking. \u201cThe quartet paved the way for a peaceful dialogue between the citizens, the political parties and the authorities, and helped to find consensus-based solutions to a wide range of the challenges across political and religious divides,\u201d she said.At the Nobel announcement, officials deflected questions from reporters about the Islamic State and other extremist groups, though Ms. Five acknowledged, \u201cWe want to prove that it is possible for Islamist and secular political movements to work together in the best interests of the people.\u201dCarlotta Gall contributed reporting from Bayeux, France, and Farah Samti from Tunis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Train Today? Ask Congress Why", "Date": "2015-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsP.T.C. is a system of complex GPS and wireless technologies that make trains safer by automatically stopping them in dangerous situations, ultimately preventing accidents caused by human error. Following a commuter train accident that killed 25 people near Los Angeles in 2008, Congress passed a law requiring virtually all commuter lines and larger railroads that carry passengers and toxic materials to install P.T.C. by the 2015 deadline.It has been clear that the railroads need additional time to meet the deadline, and the Government Accountability Office acknowledged as much recently. After Dec. 31, railroads will be faced with operating in willful violation of a law. As a result, railroads have concluded that it is not reasonable to operate on these lines after the deadline, which will effectively shut down the freight rail network. At the same time, most passenger rail services in the United States will not operate.The proposal being considered in Congress is for a three-year extension, to 2018, for getting P.T.C. installed, with potentially limited additional time for testing if approved by the secretary of transportation. The extension also has enforcement language and railroad reporting requirements for progress.The rail industry doesn\u2019t doubt the value of P.T.C. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the fatal Amtrak accident near Philadelphia earlier this year could have been prevented if the system had been installed there. Since 2008, the railroads have spent $6 billion installing P.T.C. and are at varying stages, but have maintained that the Dec. 31 deadline is not feasible. For example, BNSF, one of the largest freight networks in the country, has half of its locomotives and 85 percent of its track equipped.P.T.C. is the most significant technological innovation in railroading since the diesel engine replaced the steam engine, but it poses an unprecedented challenge. There are numerous, complex steps that need to be taken in order to implement it.Extremely precise data from train tracks and the locomotive must be integrated and processed to allow advanced hardware to stop a 100-car freight train that is over one mile long, weighs 6,000 tons and travels at 55 miles an hour \u2014 in any given location and weather. Each one of these elements must be fine-tuned, precisely aligned and must work with every other railroad\u2019s trains.Because Congress established the original deadline, only Congress can extend it. So far, this has not happened, and if it doesn\u2019t, railroads and their customers will have to take steps to anticipate the shutdown ahead of the actual deadline expiration. Shutting down railways is not like turning a light off. It is a process that will take time and significant effort. We will need to start removing rail cars, including those that carry cargo necessary for public health and safety.A shutdown will affect all Americans in some way. The products we ship by rail represent over 96 percent of all manufactured goods. If even a portion of those products is moved off the rails before Congress finally acts, it will represent more than higher costs for rail customers and loss of business: It might mean that freight required for the most basic human needs, perhaps in ways we take for granted, won\u2019t be readily available. Rail carries most of our food to market. Rail transports the chlorine that makes the drinking water of 98 percent of all Americans safe to drink.The effects of even a partial shutdown of America\u2019s freight rail network would extend well beyond human essentials like food and water; the potential impacts would be felt in higher energy prices and shortages of goods and products, as well as loss of United States market share abroad. And as public transportation officials have made clear, failure by Congress to extend the P.T.C. deadline will strand millions of commuters, putting more cars on the road each day that passenger rail service is suspended. According to a study by the American Chemistry Council, the impact could be $30 billion pulled out of the United States economy in January.Congress has acted to include the P.T.C. extension in a multiyear highway bill, the Drive Act. But finalizing that bill could slip into next year and Congress faces a deadline to vote on an extension of the bill by Thursday. We could avoid a self-inflicted crisis if Congress took the opportunity to pass the P.T.C. extension, as well.America\u2019s railways are becoming safer, faster and more energy efficient every day. In fact, 2014 was the safest year on record for freight rail. Laws and regulations play a role in that effort, but they need to be applied in a way that does not put our national economy at risk. Railroads need additional time to do this right and Congress needs to change the deadline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Ryan and Joe Biden: Unlikely Alliance of Working Fathers", "Date": "2015-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWork-Life BalancePaul Ryan and Joe Biden did something remarkable this week: They talked about the time they reserve for their families.Whether or not you believe them, it is significant that they chose to cite family obligations publicly \u2014 particularly because they are career-driven, and because they are men. It can hurt men\u2019s careers in the short term. But in the long term, if more prominent men talk about family, it could reduce the stigma significantly.The politicians acknowledged something every parent knows: It\u2019s challenging to combine work and family in the modern American economy. But in politics as well as business, it\u2019s often taboo to talk publicly about it \u2014 especially when you are trying to get a new, bigger job. \u201cSpending more time with my family\u201d can often be code for leaving a job for reasons someone doesn\u2019t want to name, like being fired.One way the flexibility stigma would be reduced is for men to ask for it as often as women do \u2014 and for non-parents to ask for it as well, for elder care and other reasons \u2014 so that mothers, and a few fathers, aren\u2019t the only ones penalized.For working parents in high-powered jobs in which flexibility is not always an option \u2014 as it won\u2019t always be for Mr. Ryan \u2014 something has to give.

Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, who has three children, said her husband also stays home.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen to Recall 8.5 Million Vehicles in Europe", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile a broad recall has been expected, the move reflects the difficulty that Volkswagen faces in fixing the 11 million vehicles worldwide that contain a so-called defeat device, which effectively lowered emissions for testing purposes. The company is indicating that the repairs may stretch beyond the end of 2016.Volkswagen had submitted a plan last week to German regulators, outlining repairs to three models of diesel engines that largely involved updating the vehicles\u2019 software. But the country\u2019s authorities considered the plan insufficient and ordered the company to recall 2.4 million vehicles on Thursday; Volkswagen later in the day adopted the German order more broadly, announcing a recall of 8.5 million diesel cars across Europe.German regulators have given Volkswagen until the end of November to lay out the technical details of the remedy. Volkswagen said it would begin recalling and repairing the German cars in January.Regulators in the United States are waiting for a detailed fix before ordering Volkswagen to recall its cars. Volkswagen officials have indicated that repairing the nearly half-million cars affected in the United States might require a more extensive solution because American standards on nitrogen oxide emissions are tougher than those in the European Union.The Environment Protection Agency \u201cwill order a recall once the agency has done testing to confirm that Volkswagen\u2019s proposed fix will be effective,\u201d a spokeswoman for the regulator, Laura Allen, said in an email on Thursday. \u201cE.P.A. will conduct our own testing to confirm this. Then we will order a recall.\u201dCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, in Virginia, who has studied auto safety issues, said the German recall was a positive development.\u201cRather than a proposal, generated by Volkswagen and subject to what they want to do, an authority is now in charge and will dictate what happens,\u201d Mr. Tobias said in a telephone interview.\u201cIt still depends on how rigorous the authority will be with Volkswagen,\u201d Mr. Tobias added. \u201cVW has always been very cautious in terms of the timeline, and we won\u2019t know for some time.\u201dThe scandal has dealt a substantial blow to a company once venerated for its engineering and quality.In the past, Volkswagen was dominated by strong personalities with a top-down style of decision making that some critics have said may have contributed to decisions that led to the scandal.At a meeting with top managers in Leipzig on Thursday, Matthias M\u00fcller, Volkswagen\u2019s new chief executive, signaled a break with that style of management, saying that future decision making would be less centralized and that Volkswagen\u2019s divisional managers would have more autonomy.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\u201cVolkswagen is not a one-man show,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said in an address.\u201cIt is definitely not my intention to intervene in decisions about products,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said, contrasting his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who liked to be involved in the minutiae of product development. \u201cWhether a windshield sits at a one-degree angle higher or not, I\u2019m not going to concern myself with that.\u201dIn the wake of the scandal, the company also appears to be shifting gears on strategy.Barbara Hendricks, the German minister for the environment, said in comments to ZDF public television early Thursday that the government should consider scrapping tax subsidies for diesel, shifting them instead to electric vehicles to encourage the more environmentally friendly technology.She later backtracked, issuing a statement in which she warned against \u201cdemonizing\u201d diesel technology, a warning that was also sounded by Germany\u2019s transportation minister, Alexander Dobrindt. According to a study by Roland Berger consultants, more than 50 percent of all new passenger cars sold in Europe run on diesel, which is favored for its fuel economy, despite its higher emission of pollutants.Volkswagen is now racing to deal with the fallout. The company faces a raft of investigations and lawsuits around the globe.Austria\u2019s transportation ministry said on Thursday that all Volkswagens with affected engines would be recalled in that country.\u201cThe K.B.A. believes that the software used in the diesel engines constitutes an illegal defeat device,\u201d said Mr. Dobrindt, adding that the mandatory recall would be overseen by the K.B.A.\u201cThe authority has demanded that Volkswagen remove the software and take all steps necessary to ensure that the emissions regulations are met.\u201dVolkswagen has said it would set aside 6.5 billion euros to cover the costs of fixing the vehicles, and indicated the costs could swell beyond that amount.On Thursday, Volkswagen shares ended the day in Germany down 3.2 percent. In all, they have lost more than a quarter of their value since the deception was disclosed on Sept. 18.The ultimate fix for all the cars, the company has said, will be complicated, requiring different solutions for different markets.While vehicles with 1.2- and 2-liter engines appeared to need only replacement software to bring them back into compliance, the 1.6-liter models would most likely require additional hardware to remedy the problem. Such hardware, Mr. Dobrindt said, would not be ready until next September.But he expressed confidence that Volkswagen would be able to meet the authority\u2019s demands. \u201cWe have the impression that Volkswagen is technically capable of carrying out the technically necessary measures,\u201d he said.Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladesh Pushes Back as Warnings of ISIS Expansion Gather Steam", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Last month, United States officials told Bangladeshi authorities that they had information suggesting that terrorists linked to the Islamic State were preparing to ramp up activity within Bangladesh\u2019s borders.Instead, Ms. Hasina has described the episodes as a conspiracy by domestic opposition leaders to tarnish her government\u2019s reputation.\u201cBangladesh is moving ahead and it\u2019ll do so,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cLet me say one thing: The march forward of Bangladesh can\u2019t be stopped by hurling two bombs or five eggs. Those who are thinking this are making a mistake.\u201dThe disconnect between Bangladesh and foreign intelligence agencies has confused Bangladeshis and foreigners alike, and could complicate efforts to prevent the expansion of international terrorist organizations in South Asia. Their emergence here could be devastating, derailing years of steady economic growth and potentially spilling into India and Pakistan.For decades, Bangladesh has grappled with a network of domestic extremist cells, some with links to opposition groups. After a period of dormancy, they appeared to have regrouped this year, carrying out four assassinations of intellectuals who have spoken out against fundamentalist Islam. At the same time, foreign security agencies have tracked Bangladeshi expatriates who are active in the Islamic State, as both recruiters and fighters, in London; Melbourne, Australia; and other cities. Command-and-control links between those groups would introduce new dangers for Bangladesh, a democracy with a population of about 160 million, nearly all Sunni Muslim.\u201cWe are taking the Islamic State claim very seriously,\u201d said a senior diplomat in Dhaka, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with protocol. \u201cWe see it unfolding around the world.\u201dSo far, evidence of those links is fragmentary. The police here have arrested more than 30 followers of the Islamic State, mainly students from prosperous families who were planning to travel to Syria or Afghanistan to fight, said Monirul Islam, joint commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. They also arrested a recruiter based in London \u201cwho was here to recruit boys,\u201d Mr. Islam said.Ali Riaz, an expert on South Asian politics at Illinois State University, said that he was \u201cseriously skeptical\u201d that major jihadi groups had an \u201corganizational presence\u201d in Bangladesh, but said that homegrown cells were eager to form affiliations.\u201cIf opportunity arises and pathways are found, these local groups will become the I.S. franchise in no time,\u201d he said.The story of last month\u2019s warning points to deep-rooted mutual suspicion between Bangladesh and foreign intelligence agencies, even as they try to build cooperation on counterterrorism.Around a month ago, intelligence agencies from the so-called Five Eyes alliance, which includes Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, received information that militants were planning an attack on foreigners in Bangladesh. On Sept. 25, Australia updated its travel advisory to report \u201creliable information of a possible militant attack against Australians,\u201d an urgent matter because its national cricket team was set to fly to Dhaka to play Bangladesh in a test match.The target was believed to be the Glitter Ball, a boozy annual costume party popular with foreigners, who in the past have organized teams dressed as Elvis impersonators, mermaids or the crew on \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Britain and the United States issued similar warnings to their citizens, based on the same information.On Sept. 27, Bangladesh\u2019s home minister dismissed Australia\u2019s \u201cmilitancy fears\u201d as \u201cbaseless.\u201d American officials, for their part, conveyed a description of the threat to officials traveling with Ms. Hasina, then in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly.She found the warnings frustrating and inconclusive, said Gowher Rizvi, an aide who accompanied her on the trip. He said the United States shared \u201cno actionable intelligence\u201d and did not say where the information originated.\u201cWe have a long history of sharing intelligence,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhy, on this occasion, are you taking unilateral actions and not sharing information?\u201dHe added that, in the past, \u201cthe credulity of the world has also been tested\u201d by flawed intelligence passed on by the United States, citing the prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.In an interview, Mr. Rizvi first said the American briefing occurred on Sept. 25 or 26; he later said it was early on Sept. 28.It was the evening of Sept. 28 when an Italian aid worker, Cesare Tavella, was shot while jogging in Dhaka\u2019s diplomatic zone; hours later, a claim of responsibility appeared on a suspected Islamic State account on the mobile messaging app Telegram and on two suspected Islamic State Twitter accounts, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors radical Islamic propaganda.Bangladeshi officials said the social media messages were not authentic, as they did after claims of responsibility for the killing of the Japanese citizen and the attack on the Shiite gathering.Mr. Rizvi said that it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to discount the possibility that the Islamic State was present in Bangladesh, but that he found it unlikely. He said that a competing theory was that domestic opposition forces were seeking to throw Ms. Hasina off balance.\u201cSomeone in the rank and file might have said, \u2018Let\u2019s stir up some confusion, this government is getting a lot of good press,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThis government is getting a lot of good press. It was her birthday. It happened the day she made her speech.\u201dMr. Islam, of the Dhaka police, complained that the warnings came too late to prevent Mr. Tavella\u2019s shooting.\u201cThey should have shared with us reliable information before the incident,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they shared, maybe we might have avoided the killing.\u201dA spokeswoman for the United States Embassy did not respond directly to the Bangladeshi criticism, or criticize Bangladesh for mishandling the intelligence.\u201cForeign governments have shared what information they have had with their Bangladeshi partners, but it is important to recognize terrorist attacks like what we have seen recently in Bangladesh are particularly difficult to counteract,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Nancy VanHorn. \u201cWe stand ready to continue working with Bangladesh in the face of this challenge.\u201dSiegfried O. Wolf, a professor of political science at the South Asia Institute of the University of Heidelberg, said that foreign intelligence agencies did withhold sensitive information from Bangladesh, fearing that it could be misused. The country is in the grip of extreme political polarization, he said, and there is factionalism and rivalry among security agencies.Moreover, mistrust of the United States runs deep in Bangladesh and carries a personal element for Ms. Hasina, going back to the longstanding suspicion that the Central Intelligence Agency had a hand in the 1975 assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujib. More recently, she was disappointed by Washington\u2019s cool response to her party\u2019s controversial 2014 election victory, and by the withdrawal of trade preferences for the garment industry.Some countries have lent support to her skepticism. Alexander A. Nikolaev, the Russian ambassador to Dhaka, suggested that the United States and its allies were exaggerating the threat, remarking after the two shootings that \u201ctwo drops of water doesn\u2019t mean rainfall.\u201dOver a month, the initial panic among expatriates has subsided, and foreigners have begun to reappear in Dhaka\u2019s supermarkets and five-star hotels. But they no longer walk on the streets, ride scooters or take bicycle rickshaws. The garment export industry, a major driver of the economy, has also been affected, with some buyers for Western clothing retailers canceling their annual visits, typically used to place orders for winter.Diplomats here say the threat remains serious. One senior Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity for reasons of protocol, said the heightened threat was a \u201ccomplete game changer\u201d that would permanently affect security conditions for foreigners.\u201cThis is not going to blow over,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThe genie is not going back in the bottle. It\u2019s not going to un-change.\u201dFor those Bangladeshis already apprehensive about militant activity, the contradictory messages have deepened their anxiety.\u201cThe way this government is denying the existence of Islamic State, it is not acceptable at all,\u201d said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a journalist at Prothom Alo, a prominent daily newspaper, who last month received a written threat on his mobile phone from \u201cIslamic State Bangladesh\u201d after he wrote an article about Uighur Islamic terror groups in China.\u201cStop reporting against Islam and Muslims\u2019 interests, otherwise we\u2019re here to push you down to hell,\u201d the message said.Two weeks later, a stranger stopped him as he was riding a rickshaw and threatened him with a gun; he escaped on foot into a candy store. When he reported the episode to the police, he said, an official told him to stop riding rickshaws. Since then, he has stopped making television appearances, and, on the advice of his editor, varies the route he takes to work.\u201cWe are in a very difficult position to understand the real danger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not hearing anything from the government, or from the U.S. side, about what was the threat, what was the reaction of the government, why they are not cooperating.\u201dJulfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Brands in Investors\u2019 Headlights", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion trends may change with seasons, but one that has never gone out of style is the appetite for brand acquisition by groups both in and out of the 230 billion euro luxury sector.Big-name deals in the last 12 months have primarily involved private equity groups, including a buyout of Roberto Cavalli by the Italian company Clessidra in April and investment in Proenza Schouler by Castanea Partners of Massachusetts in June. That activity followed years of industry consolidations, largely fueled by an arms race for acquisitions between the leading luxury conglomerates LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering.But the slowdown in demand from China as a result of its cooling economy, coupled with continuing currency volatility, has damped growth \u2014 and has probably led to more caution in spending for many major companies.\u201cThe fact that expansion in the industry will be more difficult to achieve going forward has prompted some companies to take a more prudent approach to costs and capital allocation, including when looking at possible mergers and acquisitions,\u201d said Luca Solca, head of luxury research at Exane BNP Paribas.Prudent does not mean entirely paused however, and conversations, as well as rumors, persist.So which brands, if any, could be takeover candidates? Following are some of the names most mentioned as attractive targets.Salvatore FerragamoMr. Solca calls Salvatore Ferragamo, the Florentine brand that showed its spring collection in Milan on Sunday, \u201cthe most desirable and likely acquisition target in the medium term.\u201dItalian mid-range brands have drawn attention in the past from cash-rich conglomerates that could feed global expansion plans \u2014 another name frequently thrown into the ring is Missoni.But a slower Asian market means that strategy has plateaued for many, and the chief executive of Ferragamo, Michele Norsa, has consistently denied that the brand, which listed on the Hong Kong Hang Seng index in 2011, is for sale.Sergio RossiAccessories are an area experiencing an uptick in mergers and acquisitions. Rumors floated this year that Sergio Rossi, the Italian shoe brand, was on the block and that Kering, its owner, was in advanced sales talks after a strategic review. This month, the Italian buyout firm Investindustrial was said to be in advanced talks as the buyer.Tiffany & CompanyKnown for its engagement rings and little blue boxes, Tiffany has had its share price fall 30 percent since the start of this year, reducing its valuation and therefore, making it more affordable to a potential bidder. (Watches and jewelry remain a prime area of potential consolidation.)The American jeweler, a public company, has long been seen as a possible target. However, given its size and a recent improvement in the company performance, the odds of a takeover are currently unlikely.Victoria BeckhamA splintering of demand \u2014 caused by the rise of digital media and the increasing sophistication and diversification of consumer tastes \u2014 has meant that many shoppers have turned away from mega- labels such as Gucci or Louis Vuitton in favor of smaller, independent names. A stake-building war emerged between LVMH and Kering, with the French luxury powerhouses eyeing smaller brands with long-term growth potential.Victoria Beckham, based in London, is said to have received approaches from both groups, although a spokeswoman said this year that the brand had \u201cno current plans to sell any part of the business.\u201d Watch this space.Simone RochaAnother crucial reason for the smaller- brand buyouts is securing young talent for future development and Simone Rocha, one of the brightest young things on the London scene, has received multiple investment overtures. In recent years LVMH has taken stakes in Marco de Vincenzo and J.W. Anderson, also naming its designer, Jonathan Anderson, creative director at its Spanish fashion house Loewe.At the same time, Kering has bought a controlling stake in the London designer Christopher Kane\u2019s brand and made an investment in Joseph Altuzarra in New York. But Kering now says that those investments are no longer a priority.\u201cCurrently, there is nothing in our acquisition pipeline, and our focus is on organic growth\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, Kering\u2019s group managing director. \u201cOur main focus is on building up and expanding brands we already have, including smaller brands like Christopher Kane and Tomas Maier, where we can use our distribution channel or store building power to help consolidate the businesses.\u201dRag & BoneIn the United States, contemporary brands\u2019 stylish wares, at more accessible prices than high luxury labels, have gained attention and are attracting interest from Europe.The Rag & Bone partners David Neville and Marcus Wainwright took investment from the private equity firm Irving Place Capital in 2013 and are now rumored to be considering further minority stakeholders to fuel the growth of the business, which recently opened flagships in London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.\u201cSmaller American sellers are aware that strategic partnerships can add significant value to a deal,\u201d said Gary Wassner, co-chief executive of Hilldun, a New York group that helps finance young designers.He added that the buyout market for smaller brands \u2014 particularly in the United States \u2014 remains \u201cincredibly active.\u201d\u201cIn the past, strategic meant primarily sourcing partners,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow it means executive level support as well \u2014 the kind and level of support smaller brands cannot necessarily afford to hire on their own, even with an investment partner.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a New York company that helps finance young designers. It is Hilldun, not Hillman.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Could Raising Taxes on the 1% Do? Surprising Amounts", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a sharp divide, however, between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to taxing the rich, who provide most of the cash for political campaigns.All the Republican tax proposals, in fact, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Democrats, on the other hand, are prepared to raise taxes at the top, though they have not been very specific about how they would do so.But what could a tax-the-rich plan actually achieve? As it turns out, quite a lot, experts say. Given the gains that have flowed to those at the tip of the income pyramid in recent decades, several economists have been making the case that the government could raise large amounts of revenue exclusively from this small group, while still allowing them to take home a majority of their income.By comparison, the band of taxpayers right below them, in the 95th to 99th percentile, pay on average about $1 out of every $4. Those in the bottom half pay less than $1 out of every $10.Sidestepping for the moment the messy question of just which taxes would be increased, how much more revenue could be generated by asking the rich to pay a larger share of their income in taxes?Raising their total tax burden to, say, 40 percent would generate about $157 billion in revenue the first year. Increasing it to 45 percent brings in a whopping $276 billion. Even taking account of state and local taxes, the average household in this group would still take home at least $1 million a year.If the tax increase were limited to just the 115,000 households in the top 0.1 percent, with an average income of $9.4 million, a 40 percent tax rate would produce $55 billion in extra revenue in its first year.A tax rate of 45 percent on this select group raises $109 billion, more than enough to pay for the first year of a new $2,500 child tax credit introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\u201cMost economists today would agree that raising taxes modestly would bring in more revenue\u201d without doing any serious damage to the economy, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. The big question is how much is too much, because at some point, higher tax rates would discourage extra investment and work.All the Republican candidates share the party\u2019s traditional opposition to raising taxes on the wealthy, arguing that it would ruin the economy by sopping up money that would otherwise be used to create jobs. Lowering taxes, they say, will unleash a torrent of economic activity that will in the long run spur growth and revenue.But most mainstream economists, including some on the conservative side of the divide, concede that even with optimistic projections about growth and spending cuts, the Republican plans would leave a whopping budget gap, requiring more borrowing, not less. Revamping the tax code along these lines would also decrease the share paid by those at the top.That shift is behind Senator Sanders\u2019s repeated vow to compel Wall Streeters and others in the Rolex-and-Maserati set to pay more than they do now.\u201cLet me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today \u2014 taxes in the future than they\u2019re paying today,\u201d he declared in Las Vegas.Aided by a phalanx of lawyers and accountants, the rich have become adept at figuring out ways to shift earnings that would normally be taxed at the top 39.6 percent rate on ordinary income into capital gains, said the economist Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, who is researching the link between widening inequality and tactics \u2014 legal and illegal \u2014 used by the wealthy to sidestep taxes.\u201cWhy give a blank check to all of these guys?\u201d Mr. Stiglitz, the liberal economist, asked. He pointed out that current tax law makes no distinction between, say, investing abroad, speculating in land or building a new factory. A better approach, he said, is to say: \u201cWe\u2019ll give you generous deductions if you invest in America.\u201dEliminating the preferential rates on capital and dividends would generate $1.34 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said maneuvering any tax overhaul \u201cthrough that gauntlet of special interests is a herculean task.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the estimated amount of federal tax revenue that would be generated by ending the deferral on corporate profits kept overseas. It is $900 billion, not $900 million.It also misstated the amount of additional tax revenue that would be produced by raising the total tax burden of the top 1 percent of taxpayers to 45 percent. It would bring in $276 billion, not $267 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Baron\u2019s Trial May Hinge on His Secretly Recorded Conversations ", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in the end, another of his qualities \u2014 his penchant for secretly recording his own conversations \u2014 may help bring Mr. Blankenship down.Defense lawyers say they will prove that Mr. Blankenship was deeply concerned with mine safety, and that he had committed no \u201cwillful violations\u201d of safety laws, as the government asserts.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s rise and fall are the stuff of legend in Appalachia. Raised in a poor county, he built Massey from a family-owned company into an industry behemoth that operated more than 150 mines and brought in $2.6 billion in revenue. As prosecutors make their case against him, they have so far played 19 snippets from hundreds of hours of Mr. Blankenship\u2019s secret audio files, which were turned over by the company that acquired Massey after the blast.The tapes offer a peek into the mind of a man seemingly consumed with his own wealth and frustrated with federal regulators and company officials who pushed for more attention to safety. The prosecution hopes to offer three more recordings, but on Thursday, defense lawyers asked Judge Irene C. Berger, who is presiding over the case, to block them.He worries how things will look if Massey is sued. \u201cIf that was a fatal today, or if we had one,\u201d Mr. Blankenship says, an apparent reference to an accident, \u201cit\u2019d be a terrible document to be in discovery.\u201d\u201cThe truth of the matter,\u201d Mr. Blankenship is heard saying, \u201cis black lung is not an issue in this industry that is worth the effort they put into it.\u201dThe recordings also reveal Mr. Blankenship\u2019s clashes with Massey\u2019s compensation committee over a $12 million pay package for him that included stock options. \u201cI said, \u2018You can\u2019t go to the grocery store and buy groceries with options,\u2019\u201d he tells a woman he was dating, after remarking that he was glad she liked the flowers he had sent.Mr. Blankenship, 65, faces up to 31 years in prison on three felony counts, including conspiracy to violate mine safety standards and hide hazards from federal inspectors, lying to securities regulators and misleading investors about safety practices in an effort to maintain Massey\u2019s stock price \u2014 and his fortune. He has denied any wrongdoing.\u201cPoliticians, Democrats and Republicans, flocked to Blankenship,\u201d said Patrick McGinley, a law professor at West Virginia University who contributed to the state inquiry. \u201cHe was viewed by many as untouchable, just like all the other corporate executives of coal companies that killed scores or hundreds or thousands of miners over the last century.\u201dProsecutors say that Mr. Blankenship was involved in the minutest details of life at Upper Big Branch, informed nearly every day of safety violations there, and that he had overruled managers who wanted to fix safety problems, demanding instead that they step up production and \u201crun coal.\u201dDavid Hughart \u2014 a former high-level Massey executive who is serving a 42-month prison term connected to the 2010 disaster \u2014 testified to that effect this week, telling jurors he had approved safety shortcuts under \u201cpressure to run, produce coal.\u201d Mr. Hughart is one of four employees who have been convicted in connection with an investigation that followed the explosion.Defense lawyers have countered with, among other things, Mr. Blankenship\u2019s handwritten notes; he shunned computers. In one note, he approved purchases of safety equipment; in another, he berated underlings for not moving fast enough on a plan to reduce violations.\u201cThe only thing more frightening to our future than regulators is us,\u201d Mr. Blankenship wrote.Mr. Blankenship\u2019s recordings are \u201ca gift he gave to the families\u201d of the dead miners, said Judy Jones Petersen, a Charleston doctor whose brother Dean Jones, a mine foreman, was killed. \u201cThe jury gets an opportunity to hear this snively character whining about his stock options,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s rather pathetic.\u201dThe trial has also painted a grim portrait of conditions at Upper Big Branch, where rough-hewn miners working miles underground often feared for their safety. Several testified that they had been tipped off, in code language by superiors, when federal inspectors were on the way and been told to hastily fix violations.One former miner, Brent Racer, described hearing the president of the Massey subsidiary that operated Upper Big Branch hassling a mine boss who tried to improve ventilation, telling him, \u201c\u2018We would get more air soon, and we needed to worry about running.\u2019\u201dAnother, Gary Young, worked the overnight shift as a \u201crock duster\u201d spreading limestone dust, a protective coating to hold down coal dust and prevent explosions. He told the jury that his equipment was often broken, and his shifts often truncated. Frustrated, he kept a journal to communicate with his manager. His last entry, two weeks before the blast, read, \u201cI\u2019m set up to fail.\u201dDefense lawyers have not said whether Mr. Blankenship will testify, but at court, he cuts an awkward figure. Accompanied by a team of Washington lawyers, he arrives each morning carrying a slightly battered black briefcase and walks, tight-lipped, past television cameras and reporters asking questions. During a break the other day, he sat by himself on a bench outside the courtroom.He is not without supporters. Shannon Westerman, 77, a retired business owner who worked with Massey on a coal safety awareness program, turned up in court the other day to shake Mr. Blankenship\u2019s hand.\u201cI think this is a political and media effort to destroy him,\u201d Mr. Westerman said.Coal mining has long been the lifeblood of the economy here, and many of the families who lost loved ones in the blast have deep roots in the industry.Gary Quarles, a retired miner whose son, Gary Wayne Quarles, 33, died in the blast, was a miner himself. He and his wife, Patty, who has a tattoo on her left ankle of her son wearing his black miner\u2019s hard hat, have been attending the proceedings.The trial began last week; it is expected to run into November. By the end, Mr. Quarles said, the public will \u201csee what kind of man Don really is.\u201d Five years after losing their son, the couple would like to see Mr. Blankenship convicted. But seeing him in court \u2014 surrounded by lawyers, listening to himself referred to as \u201cthe defendant\u201d \u2014 is a kind of satisfaction in itself.\u201cTo me, his privileges are gone,\u201d Mrs. Quarles said. \u201cAs of right now, he can\u2019t go to the Riviera. He can\u2019t go to Vegas like he wanted to. He now is at someplace he\u2019s never been, and that\u2019s being controlled by other people. He\u2019s not used to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew at 1.5% Rate in Third Quarter", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAppearances can be deceiving.Even as the economy decelerated last quarter, mostly because of more cautious stockpiling by companies as economic turmoil overseas intensified, the American consumer kept right on spending. And most American businesses, in making their longer-term investment decisions, weren\u2019t far behind.While the overall rate of growth was a decidedly lackluster 1.5 percent last quarter, according to the Commerce Department report on Thursday, spending by consumers on goods like furniture and services like health care and insurance advanced at more than twice that pace.\u201cThe good news is that the important engine of personal consumption remains strong,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cThe headline data was slightly disappointing, but the persistent strength of personal consumption bodes well for a continued modest expansion in the U.S. economy.\u201dThe tempo of growth over the summer, which was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, represented a marked drop from the 3.9 percent pace of expansion in the spring.But the downshift was mostly the result of slower inventory accumulation as businesses let stockpiles of goods in warehouses and on store shelves unwind rather than making big additions as they did in the first half of 2015. Nonfarm inventories increased at half the rate they did in the second quarter, a reduction that shaved 1.44 percentage points off the overall figure for growth in the third quarter.Business activity presented a mixed picture \u2014 investment in equipment and intellectual property rose, but spending on structures fell, a trend experts attributed to cutbacks in the energy industry in response to the sharp decline in oil prices over the last 12 months.In addition to buoyant consumer activity, residential investment was also healthy, a sign that the housing market, after a long period of suffering, is now providing the economy with a fresh tailwind. Government spending also provided a small kick to growth.Stocks traded slightly lower, but bond yields ticked up, indicating that traders are once again leaning toward the view that the Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark interest rate in December.\u201cOutside of the inventory correction, this was a solid report,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \u201cIt bolsters the case that we will see a bounceback in growth,\u201d he added, noting that his bank expecting a growth rate in the current quarter of about 2.5 percent.In terms of the drag from stockpiles, \u201ccompanies scaled back their expectations,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, but looking ahead to the final quarter this year, inventories \u201cshould diminish as a headwind.\u201dInflation also remained tame, according to the Commerce Department. The index for core consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter, well below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve.In a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the government reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to 260,000 last week, less than expected. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which can be more reliable than the week-to-week snapshot, fell to its lowest level since 1973 and suggested that hiring should be fairly strong.The pluses and minuses buried in the fine print of Thursday\u2019s reports on economic output and hiring highlight the contradictions that economists, Federal Reserve policy makers and ordinary consumers all have to contend with after more than six years of tepid economic growth.Some industries \u2014 technology, health care, finance \u2014 are enjoying conditions that echo the booming 1990s or the housing bubble of a decade ago.Things could not be more different, however, in areas of the economy that depend on commodity prices, like the oil and gas industry, which has been cutting jobs, reflecting a downturn in energy prices. Manufacturers that service those industries, like steel makers, have also felt a chill.Echoing this pattern, economic conditions are best on the coasts, led by places like New York, Boston, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Silicon Valley and the Seattle area, while broad areas of the once-thriving midsection of the country are now struggling.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of folks moving into the Bay Area getting jobs, and you see the growing pains that come with that, like traffic and housing affordability,\u201d Mr. Anderson, the economist at Bank of the West, said. \u201cThe incubator is the tech sector, but it\u2019s broader-based than that.\u201dAt the same time, he said, \u201cthe decline in energy and commodities is having a detrimental effect on growth from Texas north to Minnesota.\u201dThursday\u2019s report is the first of three estimates the government will make, and the numbers are bound to be revised upward or downward as more data comes in.Fed officials are still trying to determine when economic conditions will justify a long-anticipated increase in short-term interest rates, which the central bank has held near zero for nearly seven years.On Wednesday, as expected, the Fed left rates unchanged. But officials signaled that an increase could come when they meet in mid-December, especially if economic growth and employment pick up in the fourth quarter. The Labor Department will issue two monthly reports on the job market before that meeting, with the first, for October, to be released on Nov. 6.For the current quarter, experts are anticipating that the economy will bounce back as the drag from slower inventory-building fades. The consensus view today is for gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, to advance at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent, a little better than the overall performance of the economy since the Great Recession ended.\u201cThe Q3 G.D.P. report was soft with respect to the headline figure, but the underlying domestic demand data was in line with the pace seen in recent quarters,\u201d said Omair Sharif, rates strategist at SG Americas Securities. \u201cOn balance, this report probably does little to change the Fed\u2019s perception that the economy continues to advance at a \u2018moderate\u2019 pace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Experts Weigh Likely Impacts of China\u2019s \u2018One Child\u2019 Reversal", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The \u201cone child\u201d policy change announced by the Communist Party on Thursday left some economists and investors wondering how the government would address longer-term financial and economic pressures.The more important contributor to growth over the next several decades, experts said, would be China\u2019s efforts to increase productivity by investing in technology, health care and education.\u201cWhat drives China\u2019s future in the next two or three decades, it is not the population,\u201d said Fred Hu, the founder of Primavera Capital Group, a Chinese investment firm. \u201cIt is whether future leaders can continue to push ahead political and economic reforms.\u201d\u201cThe question is whether or not the Chinese are going to implement the kinds of reforms that will lead to a return to the rapid productivity growth we saw in the \u201980s, the \u201990s and up until the global financial crisis,\u201d he said.A small rise in the fertility rate might help spur consumption in China in the short term. But Yao Yang, director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University in Beijing, said that after two or three years, China would likely return to a lower fertility rate, similar to other East Asian countries like Japan, where each woman has an average of 1.4 children, according to the World Bank.Mr. Yao said that an aging population threatened to weigh down China\u2019s economic prospects not so much because of a shrinking work force, but because of shrinking consumer demand. He drew comparisons to Japan, saying that its struggle to revive the economy in the 1990s showed that the biggest threat came from stagnating demand as people aged.\u201cYou can always make up for the loss of the labor force,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can raise education levels. You can accelerate technological progress, and also you can use robots.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe real problem in Japan is the demand side. They\u2019re using a lot of robots, but there\u2019s no demand.\u201dChina\u2019s population has grown increasingly lopsided since the \u201cone child\u201d policy was introduced in 1979. A third of the population is expected to be over age 60 by 2050, up from about a seventh last year, placing significant strains on the government\u2019s budget and its benefits programs for older citizens.At the same time, the size of the labor force has dwindled in recent years and will probably continue to shrink, economists said, raising questions about how China will sustain a historic economic boom and pay for pensions and health insurance programs. The working-age population dropped for the first time in 2012; last year, it totaled 916 million people, down 3.7 million from 2013, according to the government.In the long term, an increase in the birthrate would likely offset some of the decline in the working-age population. But in the short term, as children remain out of the labor force and in school, it could place new pressure on the economy, as the overall share of the population dependent on the government rises.\u201cThe economically active share of the population will fall, reversing the demographic dividend that has figured so prominently in China\u2019s rapid economic growth over the past few decades,\u201d David E. Bloom, a professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s the medium-term economic danger here.\u201dSome experts said that even with the new policy, it would be difficult for China to maintain a robust level of growth.\u201cChina is facing a massive demographic headwind,\u201d said Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t think that changing this policy is going to have any impact. It\u2019s a welcome step, but I think it\u2019s too late.\u201dDespite those doubts, some Chinese saw an immediate payoff: Shares of companies that make products geared toward babies surged on Thursday. Late into Thursday night, people traded stock tips on messaging applications, with formula makers and car-seat manufacturers at the top of their lists.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing, and Michael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

That would make it much harder and more expensive for businesses to transport goods and for commuters to get to work.

{"Headline": "2 Frieze Fairs: One to Savor, One to Indulge", "Date": "2015-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cOh, mother!\u201d exclaimed Diana Widmaier-Picasso as she came face-to-face with a 1938 painting of a 3-year-old girl holding a toy boat at the Tuesday preview of the Frieze Masters fair, on the other side of Regent\u2019s Park from Frieze London, its older contemporary sibling.Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, the granddaughter of Pablo Picasso and Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, had spotted Picasso\u2019s \u201cMaya au bateau\u201d at the booth of the New York dealer Richard L. Feigen. One of a small group of portraits of Maya Picasso at age 3, it had been consigned for sale by the family of the New York dealers Eleanor and Daniel Saidenberg, priced at $27 million.\u201cI have one also,\u201d Ms. Widmaier-Picasso told the Feigen gallery president, Frances Beatty, before moving on to look at more works by her grandfather at the booth.The fourth edition of Frieze Masters \u2014 which, like Frieze London, runs through Saturday \u2014 this year features 130 international galleries showing artworks across a range of historical periods. The elegant, upscale event was created, at least in part, to give dealers in pre-21st-century pieces the chance to make \u201ccrossover\u201d sales to the wealthy contemporary collectors who for 13 years have been flocking to Frieze London.Two questions hung over this \u201cFrieze Week.\u201d First, would the momentum of demand for contemporary art that dealers experienced at Art Basel in June be maintained at Frieze in October\u2019s cooler economic climate? Second, has the much-admired Frieze Masters turned into a fair where people actually buy things, particularly older things, rather than just look at them?In terms of pure commerce, Frieze Masters remains a work in progress. After two days of the fair, Mr. Feigen was one of several dealers who had not reported any confirmed sales of pre-1950 pieces. Admittedly, multimillion-dollar Picassos have never been impulse buys \u2014 and neither are medieval architectural drawings, such as the amazing, rediscovered 1515 project for a spire at Rouen Cathedral being offered by the London dealer Sam Fogg for 2.5 million pounds, about $3.8 million. But business was also slow at the new \u201cCollections\u201d section at Frieze Masters, where eight specialist dealers were showing more affordable pieces from neglected collecting fields.In the first five hours of the preview \u2014 a period of a lot of commercial action at Frieze London \u2014 there were no early takers for the monumental Dayak wooden sculptures from Borneo priced at \u00a340,000 to \u00a3120,000 at the booth of the Brussels dealer Bernard de Grunne, or for any of the 93 Japanese netsuke carvings, marked at \u00a31,000 to \u00a350,000, being shown by the London dealer Sydney L. Moss.\u201cIt\u2019s not a feeding frenzy like Frieze. Sales take longer,\u201d said the London old masters dealer Johnny van Haeften, who showed a painting of a wedding procession by the 16th-century Flemish artist Marten van Cleve priced at \u00a31.8 million. \u201cI believe in the model,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sales and we meet new clients. Even if I\u2019m the last old master dealer left at the fair, that\u2019s fine by me.\u201dHistoric paintings have proved a particularly hard sell at Frieze Masters \u2014 Mr. van Haeften had no sales to report after the fair\u2019s first two days. The New York dealer Otto Naumann, who exhibited in London in 2013 and 2014, is one of half a dozen old master specialists who no longer show here.\u201cTwo years of not selling, except for one minor thing on consignment, which didn\u2019t come close to paying for expenses,\u201d Mr. Naumann said in an email. \u201cInvestment: $175,000. Return: zero.\u201dA second-century A.D. Roman marble head of Dionysus, priced at \u00a3500,000 by Tomasso Brothers \u2014 who were sharing a crossover booth with the contemporary gallery Karsten Schubert \u2014 was one of the few early sales of historic works.Exhibitors at Frieze Masters found it far easier to sell the sort of late 20th-century works that fit more easily into a contemporary art collection, but are older than the 2000 date-limit of the more on-trend Frieze London. The New York and London dealer David Zwirner, who represents the estate of the German painter Sigmar Polke, sold his imposing 1992 \u201cAuto (Jeep)\u201d for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, according to the gallery. Karsten Schubert sold all seven of the 1968 to 1972 Bridget Riley gouaches, priced at \u00a380,000 to \u00a3120,000, it was showing with nine classical heads from Tomasso.Frieze Masters\u2019 awkward location, a 15-minute walk from Frieze London, remains a problem. Wealthy individuals can, by contrast, easily drop in and out of the rival PAD fair in Mayfair, where a fifth-century B.C. ancient Greek silver \u201ckylix,\u201d or drinking cup, priced at more than \u00a31 million at the booth of Phoenix Ancient Art of New York, was among the early sales.Confirmed sales were a lot easier to come by at the 13th edition of Frieze London \u2014 which this year showcased 164 galleries from 27 countries \u2014 than they were at Frieze Masters.All the available works were quickly snapped up by collectors for prices between 40,000 and 200,000 euros, about $46,000 and $230,000. The seven-foot-long bronze sculpture, made in an edition of eight, was the most expensive and desirable item and Mr. Mennour has kept four available for museums. \u201cI had to say \u2018No\u2019 to some important collectors,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe desire for art is frustration. Somehow we are always rushing around and sometimes it\u2019s good to stop.\u201dThe art market is dominated by wealthy individuals\u2019 desire to own postwar and contemporary works that will be a good alternative investment. But is there the same willingness to sink money into art now that a slowing Chinese economy has triggered losses on the West\u2019s stock and commodities markets?\u201cPeople are worried,\u201d the Belgian collector Alain Servais said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a gap between primary and secondary market prices. You take the artwork out of the gallery and the re-sale price can be lower. It\u2019s like buying a new car.\u201dA case in point at Frieze London was perhaps a new \u201cArtex\u201d painting by Dan Rees offered by the London and Brussels dealers MOT International for \u00a354,000. The Berlin-based Mr. Rees (born 1982) is one of a group of young abstract painters whose work became objects of feverish speculation in 2014. Last year a Rees was \u201cflipped\u201d at auction for $233,000. This year, the highest public resale price has been $75,000. Nonetheless, the \u201cArtex\u201d painting sold at the fair.Risk-averse collectors are now concentrating on established names, or on artists who have recently gained official recognition with prizes and museum shows. The German and American dealership Galerie Buchholz found an English buyer at the preview for a $75,000, eight-meter-high inflatable sculpture of Felix the Cat by the 2008 Turner Prize-winner Mark Leckey (born 1964).Elsewhere at the Frieze preview, there were metronomic, if not frantic, sales of investment-grade works by the usual brand galleries and brand artists.White Cube sold a 2015 painting by Damien Hirst, titled \u201cHolbein (Artists\u2019 Watercolors),\u201d to an American collector. Measuring 13 feet wide, this tongue-in-cheek riff on Gerhard Richter\u2019s color chart paintings (the subject of a show at Dominique L\u00e9vy in Old Bond Street) was priced at \u00a3750,000.

{"Headline": "At Military Parade, a Rare Public Speech by North Korea\u2019s Leader", "Date": "2015-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Kim celebrated the 70th anniversary of his ruling Workers\u2019 Party on Saturday with what appeared to be one of the largest military parades the North had ever organized. As warplanes flew overhead, the plaza in Pyongyang was filled with soldiers and citizens chanting slogans of loyalty to the Kim family and waving pink and red artificial flowers in synchronized moves.In a 25-minute speech before the parade, Mr. Kim spoke of his \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdedication to the people,\u201d whom he thanked for staying with his party through decades of American-led economic sanctions and blockades.Mr. Kim\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate the economy are hampered by United Nations sanctions, prompted by the North\u2019s nuclear and long-range missile programs. His government also spends lavishly to maintain the personality cult surrounding his family.On Saturday, Mr. Kim did not mention his nuclear or missile programs but vowed to continue his policy of pursuing a nuclear arsenal and economic development simultaneously. \u201cOur revolutionary armed forces are ready to fight any form of war the American imperialists want,\u201d he said, while the only prominent foreign guest \u2014 Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Politburo \u2014 stood nearby. Mr. Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the North since Mr. Kim rose to power in late 2011. President Xi Jinping of China also sent a warm note to Mr. Kim, a sign that relations may be thawing after a deep chill.In the message, widely reported by the Chinese state media, Mr. Xi said he not only extended the congratulations of the Chinese Communist Party but sent his own personal good wishes. He hailed Mr. Kim for having achieved \u201cpositive progress in developing the economy, improving livelihoods, and so on.\u201dDespite its concerns about the North\u2019s nuclear program, China has not used its full economic leverage to discourage the North from pursuing it, apparently being more concerned about potential instability in the North that could spill into its territory. China\u2019s economic largess keeps North Korea\u2019s bare-bones economy afloat, but a debate has been roiling in the past year among Chinese military officials and academics over whether its ally is more a liability than an asset. China has also been expanding its ties to South Korea.A Chinese expert on North Korea, Yang Xiyu, said the tone of Mr. Xi\u2019s letter to Mr. Kim was fairly standard.The wording is \u201calways the same no matter whether the bilateral relationship is in good shape or bad shape,\u201d said Mr. Yang, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies. But John Delury, an associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said Mr. Xi seemed to have used the occasion to mend fences with the North, at least to a degree.\u201cXi\u2019s letter marks the Chinese leader\u2019s first real effort to make friends with Kim Jong-un,\u201d Mr. Delury said. \u201cThe fulsome praise of the Kim dynasty is new for Xi, whose administration has sounded guarded, even irritated, in its language toward Pyongyang.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s failure to mention denuclearization will disappoint those in Washington who believed that Beijing was coming around to their hard-line stance toward Mr. Kim, Mr. Delury said.The North\u2019s state-run Korean Central Television showed columns of tanks, drones and rocket tubes. South Korean officials said that the tubes included a new model with a range long enough to strike South Korean and American military bases south of Seoul. The highlight was what South Korean officials said appeared to be a new version of KN-08 long-range missiles.The KN-08 is widely believed to have been designed as the North\u2019s first intercontinental ballistic missile. But it has never been flight-tested, so when it was first shown in public in 2012 and 2013, some outside analysts said it might be a mock-up of a system still under development.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Killings of Blacks: Here Is What the Data Say", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewTamir Rice. Eric Garner. Walter Scott. Michael Brown. Each killing raises a disturbing question: Would any of these people have been killed by police officers if they had been white?I\u2019m not saying that the police in these specific cases are free of racial bias. I can\u2019t answer that question. But what the data does suggest is that eliminating the biases of all police officers would do little to materially reduce the total number of African-American killings. Police bias may well be a significant problem, but in accounting for why some of these encounters turn into killings, it is swamped by other, bigger problems that plague our society, our economy and our criminal justice system.To understand how this can be, let us start with the statistics on police killings. According to the F.B.I.\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Report, 31.8 percent of people shot by the police were African-American, a proportion more than two and a half times the 13.2 percent of African-Americans in the general population. While this data may be imperfect, other sources in individual states or cities, such as in California or New York City, show very similar patterns.Instead, there is another possibility: It is simply that \u2014 for reasons that may well include police bias \u2014 African-Americans have a very large number of encounters with police officers. Every police encounter contains a risk: The officer might be poorly trained, might act with malice or simply make a mistake, and civilians might do something that is perceived as a threat. The omnipresence of guns exaggerates all these risks.Such risks exist for people of any race \u2014 after all, many people killed by police officers were not black. But having more encounters with police officers, even with officers entirely free of racial bias, can create a greater risk of a fatal shooting.Arrest data lets us measure this possibility. For the entire country, 28.9 percent of arrestees were African-American. This number is not very different from the 31.8 percent of police-shooting victims who were African-Americans. If police discrimination were a big factor in the actual killings, we would have expected a larger gap between the arrest rate and the police-killing rate.This in turn suggests that removing police racial bias will have little effect on the killing rate. Suppose each arrest creates an equal risk of shooting for both African-Americans and whites. In that case, with the current arrest rate, 28.9 percent of all those killed by police officers would still be African-American. This is only slightly smaller than the 31.8 percent of killings we actually see, and it is much greater than the 13.2 percent level of African-Americans in the overall population.If the major problem is then that African-Americans have so many more encounters with police, we must ask why. Of course, with this as well, police prejudice may be playing a role. After all, police officers decide whom to stop or arrest.But this is too large a problem to pin on individual officers.First, the police are at least in part guided by suspect descriptions. And the descriptions provided by victims already show a large racial gap: Nearly 30 percent of reported offenders were black. So if the police simply stopped suspects at a rate matching these descriptions, African-Americans would be encountering police at a rate close to both the arrest and the killing rates.Second, the choice of where to police is mostly not up to individual officers. And police officers tend to be most active in poor neighborhoods, and African-Americans disproportionately live in poverty.In fact, the deeper you look, the more it appears that the race problem revealed by the statistics reflects a larger problem: the structure of our society, our laws and policies.The war on drugs illustrates this kind of racial bias. African-Americans are only slightly more likely to use drugs than whites. Yet, they are more than twice as likely to be arrested on drug-related charges. One reason is that drug sellers are being targeted more heavily than users. With fewer job options, low-income African-Americans have been disproportionately represented in the ranks of drug sellers. In addition, the drug laws penalize crack cocaine \u2014 a drug more likely to be used by African-Americans \u2014 far more harshly than powder cocaine.Laws and policies need not explicitly discriminate to effectively discriminate. As Anatole France wrote centuries ago, \u201cIn its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.\u201dThis is not just about drugs or law enforcement. Poverty plays an essential role in all of this. Jens Ludwig, an economist at the University of Chicago who also directs the Crime Lab there, points out: \u201cLiving in a high-poverty neighborhood increases risk of violent-crime involvement, and in the most poor neighborhoods of the country, fully four out of five residents are black or Hispanic.\u201dWe will not sharply reduce police killings of African-Americans unless we understand the social institutions that intimately tie race and crime. In her book, \u201cThe New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,\u201d Michelle Alexander argues that the American criminal justice system itself is an instrument of racial oppression. \u201cMass incarceration operates as a tightly networked system of laws, policies, customs and institutions that operate collectively to ensure the subordinate status of a group defined largely by race,\u201d she says.Individual police officers did not set these economic policies that limited opportunities or create the harsh sentencing policies that turn minor crimes into lifetime sentences.We should eliminate police prejudice because it is wrong and because it undermines our democracy. It blights \u2014 and all too often destroys \u2014 lives.But there are also structural problems underpinning these killings. We are all responsible for those.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fragile Baltimore Struggles to Heal After Deadly Police Encounter", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 The Rev. Dont\u00e9 L. Hickman Sr., pastor of one of this city\u2019s largest African-American churches, wrapped up a fiery, foot-stomping sermon one recent Sunday with a somber request. \u201cPray for the city and the mayor,\u201d he urged his congregation, reminding them that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had decided not to run again.Instead, the chapel erupted in cheers.Across the street from the Southern Baptist Church in East Baltimore, which Mr. Hickman has led for 13 years, a $16 million church-sponsored apartment complex and community center \u2014 half-built and set ablaze during riots in April \u2014 is again rising from the ground, an upbeat sign in a neighborhood of dilapidated and abandoned rowhouses. But Mr. Hickman says it will take more than \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d rebuilding for the city to heal.\u201cBaltimore,\u201d he warned, \u201cis on the brink of a breakthrough \u2014 or a breakdown.\u201dThe homicide rate is soaring. Baltimore, with roughly 623,000 people, has had 270 homicides this year, almost as many as in New York, with 281 in a city of about 8.4 million. Nearly 100 people have been murdered in Baltimore in the last three months alone, eight in the last week. Residents, angry and frightened, accuse the police of standing down and ignoring crime.Baltimore has long been a city of extremes. There is the glittering Baltimore of the Inner Harbor, of tourist treks to the aquarium and twilight Orioles games at Camden Yards. And there is the Baltimore of boarded-up rowhouses, furtive alleyway heroin deals and cut-rate corner stores where cheap booze is sold from behind bulletproof glass, the jagged Baltimore of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire.\u201dThe unrest thrust those two Baltimores together, forcing painful conversations about the city\u2019s racial divide. But in a city where blacks outnumber whites two to one, it has also been a reminder that black leadership, exemplified by Ms. Rawlings-Blake, is not a guarantee that government can manage toxic collisions of race and policing any better than white leadership has in places like Ferguson, Mo.With Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake no longer seeking re-election, Baltimore\u2019s future leader may be someone from its past.Inside, as he waited for a seat in the courtroom where pretrial motions for the officers would be heard, Hal Riedl, a retired state prison employee who is white, could barely contain his rage over a settlement he called an \u201cAl Capone-style shakedown.\u201d Of the mayor, he said acidly, \u201cShe just bought riot insurance.\u201dEveryone is hoping for a way forward, but no one seems to agree on just what that is.\u201cThe city is crying out,\u201d said Ebony Harvin, a hotel manager and assistant pastor of the New Solid Rock Pentecostal Church in Pigtown, once the city\u2019s meatpacking district. \u201cWe are hoping for a better Baltimore, but it starts with leadership. If you\u2019re trying to move forward and one of your legs doesn\u2019t function well, eventually you\u2019re going to fall down, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in our city.\u201dAnother HomicideThe bouquet of metallic balloons, with messages like \u201cGod Bless You\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Missed,\u201d tied to a tree in the 2400 block of Barclay Street in East Baltimore was a familiar, grim sign. Another killing had taken place. Another candlelight vigil was about to get underway.In a city where most homicides merit brief newspaper articles, Mr. Butler\u2019s attracted more attention than most, because the bullets aimed at him also injured his cousin, a 9-year-old girl. He was one of 13 people shot, and four killed, in a single September weekend.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d his sister, Brenda Baskerville, said. \u201cEven in times of struggle and recession, it has never been this out of control.\u201dMarquel Averette, who grew up playing football and riding skateboards with Mr. Butler and now owns a barbershop nearby, said his friend\u2019s killing reflected decades of neglect. \u201cWhen we were young, we had rec centers, we had a community,\u201d he said. Of the police: \u201cTheir answer is to arrest everybody.\u201d Of politicians: \u201cWe need to clean house.\u201dThe police were just a few blocks away when Mr. Butler was killed, wrapping up an outdoor Movie Night program that Maj. Steven Ward, the commander of the department\u2019s eastern division, began after the riots, he said, to \u201crefocus on community relations.\u201dLike most homicides in Baltimore, Mr. Butler\u2019s is unsolved; as more people are being killed here, fewer killers are being caught. The homicide \u201cclearance rate,\u201d the percentage of killings solved by the police, was 45.5 percent last year; today it is 32.8 percent, the police said. Nationally, the rate was 64 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which the Justice Department has statistics.In response, the Rawlings-Blake administration has created a \u201cwar room\u201d \u2014 a controversial term here, given tensions between the police and residents \u2014 where detectives, prosecutors and federal agents trace weapons and track down criminals. Mr. Davis, the police commissioner, says the team has identified 238 \u201cgun toters,\u201d all suspected of homicides or nonfatal shootings. None are behind bars.The Rev. Westley West, 27, who has been organizing demonstrations against the police (and was recently arrested and charged with attempting to incite a riot), led the vigil for Mr. Butler. \u201cI\u2019m tired of mothers crying,\u201d he said, as a crowd gathered around. \u201cI\u2019m tired of families broken by senseless gun violence.\u201dThe sidewalk ceremony was brief, just 10 minutes, enough time for mourners to light candles, observe a moment of silence to remember the slain man, and shout his name to the heavens. Mr. West could not stay; he was busy planning a \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stand Another Homicide\u201d rally. Nor would he attend Mr. Butler\u2019s funeral.He was already booked with two others that day.The Aftermath of UnrestWith its cobblestone streets, oyster bars, lively pubs and trendy cafes, Fell\u2019s Point, home to Baltimore\u2019s oldest deepwater port, is slightly more than three miles south, yet a vast metaphysical distance, from the block where Mr. Butler lived. Yet here, Beth Hawks, the owner of Zelda Zen, a jewelry and gift boutique, is despondent over the future of the city she has lived in and loved for 35 years.\u201cBaltimore,\u201d Ms. Hawks said, \u201cis breaking my heart.\u201dOn a rainy summer night, Ms. Hawks could be found in a cavernous auditorium, filled with mostly white residents who had come to unload their grievances on Ms. Rawlings-Blake, at a community forum on crime, one of a series that the mayor has convened.One woman complained about \u201cblatantly open drug deals and prostitution\u201d in her neighborhood, saying she no longer felt safe, \u201ceven during the day.\u201d A man said that when he walks outside \u201cat 10:30 at night, and I don\u2019t see a single police person, it freaks me out.\u201dThen Ms. Hawks stood up, and burst into tears.\u201cI love this city, I love it with all my heart, but I cry every day driving to work, and I cry every day driving home,\u201d she said through sobs.\u201cThe lawless are becoming a protected class, and hard-working people are losing everything,\u201d she went on, pleading with Ms. Rawlings-Blake to \u201cget on the national media\u201d and turn Baltimore\u2019s \u201cdecimated\u201d reputation around.While investment is booming in some parts of Baltimore, tourism, critical to the local economy \u2014 and especially to Fell\u2019s Point \u2014 declined during the unrest, and has yet to recover. Hotel occupancy is down roughly 9 percent since April; ticket sales at city museums and attractions have dropped. Anirban Basu, the chairman of the Maryland Economic Development Commission, warned that the \u201creputational impact\u201d could last for years.The Fell\u2019s Point sidewalks were nearly empty on a recent Friday afternoon, save for some homeless people wandering the brick-paved town square. Claudia Towles, who owns a high-end toy store, Amuse, looked out her front window, past a display of brightly colored scooters, and frowned at the sight of parking spots on the street.\u201cWe\u2019re normally packed on Fridays,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople used to double-park.\u201dMore than a half-dozen candidates \u2014 including Sheila Dixon, a former mayor forced out by scandal; Carl Stokes, a member of the City Council; State Senator Catherine E. Pugh; and Mike Maraziti, a Fell\u2019s Point tavern owner \u2014 say they will run in the Democratic primary, which in this heavily Democratic city essentially decides who will be mayor. With a primary scheduled for April, no clear favorite has emerged.Ms. Towles, the toy store owner, said the city could not wait for elections. \u201cChange,\u201d she said, \u201cneeds to happen now.\u201dNew AlliancesOn the lush, wooded campus of Johns Hopkins University, which sprawls over 128 acres north of downtown, Ronald J. Daniels, the university\u2019s president, is also struggling with what comes next. On a recent Tuesday evening, more than 150 Baltimore residents gathered for cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres at his expansive brick Georgian home.Standing in a corner, in his customary dark pinstriped suit and tie, nodding approvingly, was Pastor Hickman.All around Baltimore, people are grasping for similar connections.\u201cA lot of people in white and wealthy corporate America said, \u2018What did we not do, to make these neighborhoods better?\u2019 \u201d said Tessa Hill-Aston, the president of the Baltimore chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., who also attended the Johns Hopkins reception. \u201cThere\u2019s not a corporate board meeting where Freddie Gray\u2019s name doesn\u2019t come out of everyone\u2019s mouth.\u201dTo Mr. Hickman, these are hopeful signs. But as he looked around Mr. Daniels\u2019s elegantly appointed living room that evening \u2014 just hours after a judge had set Nov. 30 as the date for the first of the six trials in Mr. Gray\u2019s death \u2014 he also felt a sense of unease as he contemplated the murky path forward.\u201cThe city is definitely on hold,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cWe\u2019re on \u2018pause,\u2019 waiting to press \u2018play.\u2019 \u201dAn article on Wednesday about Baltimore\u2019s struggles after the death of Freddie Gray, who died of injuries suffered in police custody, misstated the ownership of an apartment and a community center, which were set afire during riots in April. The complex is sponsored by, but not owned by, the Southern Baptist Church in East Baltimore. (An investment partnership owns the complex.) Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Stock Sinks After a Warning on Sales", "Date": "2015-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe news sent Walmart shares plunging, casting a pall over retail stocks, as analysts worried about broader ripple effects across the economy, and about consumer spending ahead of the holiday season.Walmart\u2019s slowing performance underscored concerns that its superstores, which once upended the way people shopped and for decades dominated the world of retail, are finally succumbing to nimbler rivals in the sprawling world of Internet commerce.Sales will be flat this year, Walmart said at a meeting with investors in New York. The retailer previously said that it expected net sales to grow 1 to 2 percent for the current fiscal year, through January.Shares in Walmart fell 10.04 percent to $60.03, their worst one-day slump in 17 years.Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said the company needed to invest to return to growth.\u201cWe can deliver stronger financial performance in the short term simply by running our core business better, but that won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Mr. McMillon said.In a bid to soften the blow, Walmart also announced a new $20 billion share buyback program. Still, Walmart, eclipsed by Amazon this year as the world\u2019s biggest retailer by market capitalization, lost more than $20 billion in market value as its shares fell to their lowest level in three years. So far this year, Walmart\u2019s shares are down 30 percent.\u201cRetail history is very clear,\u201d Mr. McMillon said. \u201cThose that are unwilling or unable to change go away. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking decisive steps now to change and grow our business.\u201dBurt P. Flickinger III, managing director of the Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point of demarcation. As of today, it\u2019s clear Amazon is clearly eclipsing Walmart as the No. 1 growth retailer for the next decade.\u201dWalmart\u2019s executives, Mr. Flickinger said, made many meaningful improvements, including finally pouring serious resources into its online and delivery operations. But as growth continues to stall, investors realized that even those efforts would fall short in the face of the fierce competition facing brick-and-mortar retailers.Walmart\u2019s woes sent ripple effects through the wider retail sector, as worries mounted over what is expected to be weak holiday spending this year.The National Retail Federation, a trade group, said last week that it expected sales in November and December to rise 3.7 percent to $630 billion, less than last year\u2019s 4.1 percent gain. Figures released by the Commerce Department earlier Wednesday showed overall retail sales virtually flat in September.Target shares fell 3.5 percent, while Dollar General slumped 4.2 percent. Sears fell 3.0 percent. \u201cAmazon\u2019s clearly winning the retail wars with its advanced robotics and so on,\u201d Mr. Flickinger said. \u201cWalmart is already a proverbial light year behind Amazon in online retailing.\u201dMr. McMillon acknowledged that competition with e-commerce juggernauts, as well as discounters, remained tough. But in a shot at Amazon, he defended the advantages of Walmart\u2019s large physical store over purely online merchants, asking whether it was easier for a brick-and-mortar store to build up e-commerce or for an e-commerce player to build out stores.Walmart\u2019s strength, he said, lay in giving consumers the choice of shopping at its superstores or its increasing number of smaller \u201cneighborhood\u201d stores, or online, with products available for in-store pickup or for home delivery. Only Walmart could provide that wide array of options at a huge, nationwide scale, he said.\u201cWe like our chances,\u201d Mr. McMillon said.Mr. McMillon also said he was willing to close stores that were underperforming, as well as sell assets. That prompted speculation over a potential spinoff of businesses, like Sam\u2019s Club, whose performance has lagged, as well as exits from difficult international markets.Though Walmart has bolstered growth in some markets overseas, like Mexico and Canada, it has struggled further afield, including in Britain, where Walmart\u2019s Asda chain has been engaged in a price war in a hypercompetitive grocery business.Walmart\u2019s growth in China and in Brazil has also lost steam as economies slowed in those markets. In the most recent quarter, net sales at Walmart\u2019s international stores fell by almost 10 percent.Walmart has said it is also addressing erratic scheduling practices that have come under fire from labor groups for the destabilizing effect it has on workers\u2019 incomes and livelihoods.But it still faces pressure to do more to improve the lot of its lowest-paid employees \u2014 including committing to raising pay to at least $15 an hour.\u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d one worker says. \u201cWe can\u2019t survive on these wages,\u201d says another.Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s departing chief financial officer, said earnings per share would fall 6 to 12 percent next year before they would recover. He said profits would rebound by fiscal year 2019, when earnings per share were expected to grow 5 to 10 percent a year.The company\u2019s executive vice president, Brett Biggs, is set to succeed Mr. Holley at the end of the year.Mr. Holley also said that the company expected sales to increase in a range of $45 billion to $60 billion over the next three years, the equivalent of the annual sales of many of the country\u2019s biggest corporations. The company trails Amazon by market capitalization, but Walmart\u2019s sales \u2014 which reached $482 billion last year \u2014 dwarf Amazon\u2019s annual revenue of about $89 billion.Walmart\u2019s size has not calmed investors\u2019 fears or translated into confidence in the retailer\u2019s future. Mr. McMillon acknowledged as much, telling investors in a question-and-answer session that the biggest and the best were not the same.Still, \u201cthis is a growth company,\u201d Mr. McMillion said. \u201cIt just happens to be a really large growth company.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}

Labor unions will rally in a \u201cfree speech zone.\u201d College students who could not get one of the scarce tickets into the debate arena are writing indignant letters and waging protests for a louder voice at the event.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason they call it People\u2019s Republic of Boulder,\u201d said Aaron Estevez-Miller, a senior economics major lobbying for more students to be allowed into the debate, which will be hosted by CNBC.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely a minority,\u201d Mr. Hine said. \u201cWhen we take our booth around to public events, street fairs, people walk by and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know there were any Republicans in Boulder County!\u2019 \u201dDebate organizers are allowing about 1,000 audience members. The university received 100 tickets, at least half of which will go to students. To Mr. Estevez-Miller and many other students here, that is not nearly enough.\u201cIt feels like a sham, and that the students are being used as a marketing opportunity,\u201d Mr. Estevez-Miller said one recent afternoon as he and a web-television crew scouted locations for a debate-night forum featuring student hosts and panelists. \u201cWe want to participate. We want our voices to matter.\u201dAround the 31,000-student campus, that frustration is echoing in letters to the editor, an online petition and a resolution by the student government.\u201cNo one\u2019s coming away from this with positive feelings toward the G.O.P.,\u201d said James Cross, 19, a sophomore who grew up in conservative Colorado Springs and has been looking for his political center of gravity. \u201cThis is the first election I\u2019m going to be able to vote in. I want a firsthand account.\u201dIn an open letter this month, Philip P. DiStefano, the chancellor of the University of Colorado Boulder, said the university had asked organizers for additional tickets, but pointed out that the debate was primarily a television broadcast, not a live event. Previous debates this election season played to half-empty houses.The school is providing the venue, the Coors Events Center, and security at no charge. It said it expected to reap a huge publicity benefit from showing off its pink sandstone buildings and its perch just east of the jagged peaks of the Boulder Flatirons. Dozens of journalism and political science students are volunteering to help with the production. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible branding opportunity for us,\u201d said Ryan Huff, a school spokesman.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.After one Republican debate hosted in Cleveland by Fox News and another held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, people here said they were amazed that the Republicans were coming to a town that is home to the Boulder Shambhala Center, a meditation community, and Naropa University, a private college with deep roots in Tibetan Buddhism. On Oct. 10, about 9,000 people poured into a Sanders rally at an athletic field at the University of Colorado.It is a different city from the 1970s Boulder, where much of downtown was empty and Allen Ginsberg protested the transportation of nuclear waste by train to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant south of town. Today, downtown is a vibrant grid of restaurants, galleries and financial firms, and the median home price is about $762,000.\u201cThe creative class no longer lives here,\u201d said Dave Rogers, 44, who works at Elephant Journal. \u201cWe\u2019ve become quite Santa Monica-fied.\u201dThe economy is humming, with unemployment at 3.2 percent, but as the election nears, people said they wanted to hear honest debates about income inequality and climate change. Mr. Hine, the county Republican treasurer, is planning to go to a debate-watching party with fellow Boulder Republicans, but said he did not expect the forum to change many minds around town.\u201cWe get out and make our case with the public as best we can,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be a big boon to the local Republican Party?

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Investigating if Diesel Emissions Deception Was More Extensive", "Date": "2015-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen said on Thursday that more engines than previously disclosed might be in violation of European pollution rules, but that the number was relatively small.The engines \u2014 installed in models like the Golf, Passat and Jetta early in 2012 \u2014 may have software designed to provide an artificially low emissions reading when a car is undergoing official testing. The company declined to say how many vehicles might be affected, but said they were sold only for a few months in 2012. Later versions of the engine are in compliance with European rules, Volkswagen said.Even if the cars are found to violate European rules, it would not expand the number of cars considered to be in violation in the United States. Europe\u2019s pollution regulations are less stringent than those in the United States, and the vehicles are already considered in violation by the Environmental Protection Agency, that organization said on Thursday.Volkswagen is in the throes of crisis after the E.P.A. said on Sept. 18 that Volkswagen cars sold since 2009 contained software designed to trick pollution-testing devices by detecting when a vehicle was undergoing emission checks and turning on pollution controls. When not undergoing testing, the cars\u2019 emission controls would be switched off. As a result, vehicles could emit up to 40 times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxides, a component of smog that is linked to numerous lung ailments.A few days after the E.P.A. announcement, Volkswagen admitted that 11 million cars and light commercial vehicles worldwide equipped with a diesel engine line known as the EA 189 had the illegal software.The engines affected by the Volkswagen investigation described on Thursday are known as EA 288 diesel engines. A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said on Thursday that the EA 288 engines were already included among the 482,000 cars sold in the United States that have the illegal software.Volkswagen detailed the investigation in response to a report on a German-language news service. The company did not respond to inquiries late Thursday about how long it has known that additional engines might be affected, or if other designs are under scrutiny. Volkswagen said it was \u201csystematically reviewing this issue worldwide.\u201d German regulators did not react publicly to the Volkswagen statement on Thursday.The Volkswagen developments capped a day of confusing statements on Thursday from the automaker. Early Thursday, Volkswagen said it was investigating whether an additional group of engines, in addition to the 11 million, might have been equipped with illegal software. That announcement set off concern that considerably more vehicles might be affected than previously thought.Several hours later, Volkswagen issued a clarifying statement saying that most cars with EA 288 engines, which went on sale in 2012 in models like the Golf, do not contain software that violates European laws.Adding to the confusion, a Volkswagen spokesman confirmed that the EA 288 engines are in violation of United States regulations, which set stricter standards for emissions of nitrogen oxide, a harmful pollutant. But American officials said they were already aware of the second group of engines and that the total number of cars affected was unchanged.Volkswagen said it was still investigating whether a relatively small number of engines from the EA 288 line might have the illegal software. The engines in question were sold early in 2012, shortly before tougher European Union emission standards went into force.New cars offered by Volkswagen in the European Union \u201cfulfill legal requirements and environmental standards,\u201d the company said in a statement.The E.P.A., in its statement on Sept. 18 that revealed the cheating, did not use Volkswagen\u2019s engine designations to describe the vehicles involved, which included Jetta, Golf, Passat and Beetle models, as well Audi A3 cars equipped with diesel engines.A 2-liter, four-cylinder version of the EA 288 was installed in Golf, Jetta and Passat cars sold in the United States beginning in 2015, according to Car and Driver magazine. The engine was more powerful than the EA 189, the magazine said, and treated emissions partly by recycling some exhaust gases into the motor. In addition, the EA 288 had a system to inject the chemical urea into the exhaust, which if designed properly could neutralize most of the nitrogen oxide emissions.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In treating some emissions by recycling them, the engine would have placed less of a burden on the chemical system, and owners would not have had to refill a urea supply tank as often. But the recycling system can also hurt acceleration and fuel economy. Volkswagen could have been motivated to dial back the pollution controls, except during testing, to give drivers better fuel consumption and performance, engineers outside the company have said.In Internet forums, Volkswagen drivers often reported better fuel performance than in official government ratings.EA stands for \u201centwicklungsauftrag,\u201d or \u201cdevelopment order,\u201d and signified a major new engine line. Volkswagen deploys its engines and other components not only in Volkswagen cars but also in other brands belonging to the company, like Audi and Skoda. The strategy saves money because costs of development and production are spread across a large number of vehicles. But it means that any problems potentially affect a large number of vehicles.A Volkswagen spokesman was unable to say how many EA 288 vehicles over all are on the road, except that it was a significant number. Last week, German regulators ordered Volkswagen to recall 8.5 million vehicles in Europe with the illegal software. The engines in question were configured in different ways depending on the vehicle, further complicating the task of bringing them into compliance.Volkswagen has said that in some cases, the cars can be fixed by reprogramming the software. But in other cases, Volkswagen may need to install new hardware. Matthias M\u00fcller, the Volkswagen chief executive, has not ruled out giving some customers new vehicles if repairs are not possible.Volkswagen has suspended five high-ranking executives in connection with the scandal. Mr. M\u00fcller has said that a small number of employees were responsible for the illegal software.Determining how many people were in the know is one of the main goals of an internal investigation being conducted by Jones Day, an American law firm with offices in Germany. The investigation is in its early phases and it is not clear how many managers, engineers and others may eventually be implicated, but the number is expected to rise.At the least, employees with knowledge of software coding would have to have been involved.An article on Friday about an additional Volkswagen diesel engine that may be equipped with software to disable its emission control system misstated the year when the engine, the EA 288, was introduced in the United States. It was the 2015 model year, not in 2012.Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Angus Deaton Deserved the Economics Nobel Prize", "Date": "2015-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmpirical FocusMuch of his research has focused on consumption \u2014 measures of the food people eat, the condition of their housing, and the services they consume. And he has been a trailblazer in shifting the attention of economists away from the behavior of economywide aggregates such as gross domestic product, and toward the analysis of individual households.Yet for all the power that modern statistics brings, Mr. Deaton has argued forcefully that it is neither a panacea nor a substitute for economic theory.His method of careful analysis of data from household surveys has transformed four large swaths of the dismal science: microeconomics, econometrics, macroeconomics and development economics.He has brought microeconomics \u2014 traditionally a field populated by theorists \u2014 into closer connection with the data. Partly because of his influence, modern microeconomists are more likely to spend their days knee-deep in large-scale data sets describing the real-world decisions made by millions of people, and less likely to be mired in Greek-letter abstractions.Much of the empirical revolution in economics has been enabled by the tools that Mr. Deaton developed. These tools reimagine the role of economic theory, using it to organize and interpret the tidal wave of data coming from the hundreds of household surveys conducted around the world each year.This focus on empirics has been a boon for the field of econometrics, which is the application of statistical methods to economic problems. Mr. Deaton\u2019s signature achievement in this area has been in forcing empirical researchers to pay closer attention to questions of measurement. For too long, econometric analysis had proceeded as if data were simply handed down from a statistician-loving higher power. The reality is far uglier: Data are imperfect, surveys can be unrepresentative, people misreport, and attempts to recontact survey participants often fail. Mr. Deaton confronts these issues head-on, and he has taught economists how to extract meaning from imperfect data.More than any other economist I know, he understands that to get the big picture right, you\u2019ve got to get all the small details right, too.Mr. Deaton has also made important contributions to macroeconomics, which is the study of the economy as a whole. An earlier generation of macroeconomists had focused on aggregate measures, such as the total levels of consumption or income in the economy. Mr. Deaton turned instead to the behavior of individual households. He was a leader among those rejecting the prevailing fiction that the behavior of the whole economy could be treated as if it were the result of choices made by a single representative consumer.This distinction between individual and aggregate behavior is particularly important to the study of consumption. While macroeconomists had been satisfied that their theories could explain the relationship between the total level of consumption and total income in the economy, Mr. Deaton showed that those same theories struggled to explain what individual households were doing. This has spawned a large and productive continuing research program trying to understand the spending patterns of actual households.But perhaps Mr. Deaton\u2019s most important effect has been within the field of development economics, which focuses on the economies of poor countries. This is a research program born of deep personal conviction. As he recently wrote, \u201cThose of us who were lucky enough to be born in the right countries have a moral obligation to reduce poverty and ill health in the world.\u201dA generation ago, development economics was a field populated by \u201ccountry doctors\u201d \u2014 globe-trotting macroeconomists willing to make house calls to any country willing to provide them with a first-class ticket, so that they could proffer their preferred prescription, be it a more muscular industrial policy, a big push of infrastructure development, increased national savings or a faster shift to a market economy. The countries varied, but the prescriptions rarely did.The award for Mr. Deaton continues an extraordinary run for Princeton, whose other recent winners include the game theorist John Nash; Mr. Kahneman; the economic theorist Eric Maskin; the trade economist Paul Krugman, who is also a New York Times columnist; and the macroeconomist Chris Sims. Mr. Krugman has since moved to the City University of New York, while Mr. Maskin has returned to Harvard. Even with these departures, Princeton is close to drawing even with the University of Chicago, which still lists five economics laureates on its faculty. There\u2019s a pretty good chance that may happen, as several of Mr. Deaton\u2019s colleagues often feature on Nobel shortlists.I spent a lovely year at Princeton as a visiting professor in 2012 and can attest that no one commands greater respect among his colleagues than Mr. Deaton. He\u2019s an imposing presence, a man with a giant intellect and an extraordinary breadth of knowledge, who holds all economists to his exacting \u2014 indeed, intimidating \u2014 standards.More than that, he\u2019s motivated by the questions that really matter, he is intellectually relentless, he has enormous integrity and he has devoted his life to understanding and improving the lot of the poor. He\u2019s the perfect role model for any young economist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Candidates Seek Pot of Gold at End of Tax Cut Rainbow", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax PolicySeven months later, almost every candidate who made the cut for the main CNBC debate on Wednesday has announced a plan for tax cuts. And in a crucial way, they have followed Mr. Rubio\u2019s lead: They have proposed plans that would cost trillions of dollars over a decade, with no clear plan of how they would compensate for the revenue loss.But in structure, Mr. Rubio\u2019s opponents have diverged from his proposal. All the candidates want to hand out tax cuts, but you might say the others are less puppy-oriented in their tax policy than Mr. Rubio, with a more pure focus on chasing rainbows.That is, you can think of \u201cpuppies\u201d and \u201crainbows\u201d as shorthand for two of the policy aims of tax cutting. One aim is to return money to ordinary families to raise their standards of living \u2014 for example, by making it possible to afford to have nice things, like a puppy.Mr. Rubio stands out in the Republican field for proposing a major expansion of the Child Tax Credit, a policy that even its conservative supporters will tend to admit is pure puppy, no rainbow. A larger credit raises after-tax incomes for families with children, but it is unlikely to help the economy grow over all because it does not create any incentive to work, invest or produce.Because of the cost of providing such a credit, and the cost of abolishing taxes on capital gains, it\u2019s not surprising that Mr. Rubio has proposed a top income tax rate of 35 percent \u2014 lower than the current 39.6 percent, but far higher than any of his opponents in the Republican field. Every other Republican candidate with a tax plan has proposed a top rate of 28 percent or less, getting there in one of two ways.You might recognize this as extremely similar to the approach taken by Mitt Romney in 2012, but there are two important differences between his tax plan and the current crop. One is that tax rates are higher now than they were in 2012, because part of the Bush tax cuts expired in 2013, so cutting the top rate to 28 percent would lose more revenue now than when Mr. Romney wanted to do it.Ted Cruz hasn\u2019t laid out a specific tax plan, but he also says he wants some sort of flat tax. All four of these candidates say they would abolish the Internal Revenue Service.Perhaps the candidates have learned a lesson from Mr. Romney. His insistence that he would expand the tax base enough to avoid losing revenue despite sharp tax rate cuts opened him up to inconvenient questions about whose taxes he would raise. This time, candidates are simply, openly calling for trillions of dollars in net tax cuts over a decade \u2014 as much as $11 trillion, in the case of Mr. Trump \u2014 despite projected deficits.Advertisement"}

So for owners, the prospect of having a car\u2019s emissions cleaned up, only to have the car perform worse \u2014 whatever the pollution \u2014 is not sitting well.\u201cIf we take a 10 percent hit in our gas mileage, I can live with that, but I won\u2019t be happy,\u201d said Patrick Downs, who lives in Port Angeles, Wash., and owns a 2013 Jetta TDI.\u201cIf it is 25 percent or more and the performance is degraded to the point where the car has a lot less torque and pickup, that is going to make me very unhappy,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is going to make me consider not getting the fix.\u201dIt was well known among owners of Volkswagen diesels that the cars\u2019 advertised fuel economy \u2014 as shown on the window sticker \u2014 was almost always lower than their real-world performance.Michael Horn, head of Volkswagen\u2019s American unit, told a congressional panel this month that the repairs he outlined \u2014 which will take years and require significant new equipment \u2014 might result in a slightly lower top speed in the cars. But he was careful to say that the cars\u2019 fuel economy would not be lower than the rating on the window sticker.That\u2019s not satisfactory, said Jeff Hinton, the owner of a 2013 Passat diesel. \u201cEvery TDI owner will tell you, \u2018I get much better numbers, miles to the gallon, than any number that is on that Monroney sticker,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hinton, 36, said in a telephone interview from Morrisville, N.C., using a term for the window sticker.\u201cOn recent trips, 500 miles plus, I\u2019ve gotten 52 to 55 miles per gallon,\u201d Mr. Hinton said. The Environmental Protection Agency rating on the window sticker of his Passat is 40 miles per gallon on the highway.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my car recalled or reprogrammed or retrofitted in any way if it is going to hurt the performance, because that is not what I paid for,\u201d he said.The E.P.A. cannot force owners to repair their vehicles, said Julia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for the agency.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Automakers also cannot require owners to carry out the emissions recall, just as they cannot force owners to take vehicles in to complete a safety recall.That loophole means the air pollution consequences of Volkswagen\u2019s action \u2014 at least on a small scale \u2014 are irreparable if enough owners refuse to have their vehicles fixed.Volkswagen must come up with an incentive plan to make repairing the engines irresistible, said Dan Becker, the director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety.\u201cVolkswagen made this disaster; it is its responsibility to fix it,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe need to recognize that consumers may need to have an incentive to do what the law requires.\u201dThe average completion rate of repairs on recalled vehicles in the United States is 75 percent over 18 months, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Some states try to address the issue of owners who do not comply with air pollution recalls.New Jersey has a law requiring owners to have emissions recalls carried out on their vehicles and to provide proof in order to register them. But it has never been used and it would be \u201cpremature and speculative\u201d to discuss how that law might apply to Volkswagen, said Mairin Bellack, a spokeswoman for the state\u2019s Motor Vehicle Commission.\u201cIf it turns out that there is not enough of a response, we do have in California the option of putting a block on registration until the fix is done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is only as a last resort.\u201dEven before Volkswagen announced the recall remedy, diesel owners fretted about the impact.But some emissions experts say it\u2019s hard to predict the consequences, since it is not clear exactly what Volkswagen did.Federal regulators have said the automaker installed software that signaled the emissions system to work during the E.P.A. tests, but then at least partly disabled it during routine driving.Even the motivation is unclear.Part of the strategy, then, could have been to minimize mechanical wear and tear, he said.Mr. German at the International Council on Clean Transportation said that what all this meant to diesel owners would not be clear until Volkswagen provided far more information.He said there might be a loss in fuel economy, although he would be surprised if it was significant. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be, like eight miles per gallon or anything like that,\u201d he said.Consumer Reports tested two Volkswagen diesels, with and without the cheating software activated. In one of the cases, a 2015 Jetta TDI got 53 m.p.g. without the modification used to cheat, compared with 50 m.p.g. with it. The advertised fuel economy was 45 miles per gallon.Mr. German said he would be surprised if the smooth delivery of power without hesitation or surges was a major problem because vehicles today have advanced fuel-injection systems and sophisticated computers.\u201cIt is rare for there to be a drivability problem,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can almost always figure out some way to manage it.\u201dThat leaves owners like Mr. Downs in Washington State, who is waiting to see how his Jetta diesel will be affected and what to do about the recall. But he readily acknowledges he is pondering the environmental downside of not repairing the car.\u201cWhat does this mean in terms of actual environmental impact?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is millions of cars. That weighs heavy on my mind.\u201dEric Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Schools for Wisdom", "Date": "2015-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreg Whiteley\u2019s documentary argues that the American school system is ultimately built on a Prussian model designed over 100 years ago. Its main activity is downloading content into students\u2019 minds, with success or failure measured by standardized tests. This lecture and textbook method leaves many children bored and listless.Worse, it is unsuited for the modern workplace. Information is now ubiquitous. You can look up any fact on your phone. A computer can destroy Ken Jennings, the world\u2019s best \u201cJeopardy!\u201d contestant, at a game of information retrieval. Computers can write routine news stories and do routine legal work. Our test-driven schools are training kids for exactly the rote tasks that can be done much more effectively by computers.The better approach, the film argues, is to take content off center stage and to emphasize the relational skills future workers will actually need: being able to motivate, collaborate, persevere and navigate through a complex buffet of freelance gigs.There are no textbooks, no bells marking the end of one period or start of the next. Students are given group projects built around a driving question. One group studied why civilizations rise and fall and then built a giant wooden model, with moving gears and gizmos, to illustrate the students\u2019 theory. Another group studied diseases transmitted through blood, and made a film.\u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d doesn\u2019t let us see what students think causes civilizational decline, but it devotes a lot of time to how skilled they are at working in teams, demonstrating grit and developing self-confidence. There are some great emotional moments. A shy girl blossoms as a theater director. A smart but struggling boy eventually solves the problem that has stumped him all year.The documentary is about relationships, not subject matter. In the school, too, teachers cover about half as much content as in a regular school. Long stretches of history and other subject curriculums are effectively skipped. Students do not develop conventional study habits.The big question is whether such a shift from content to life skills is the proper response to a high-tech economy. I\u2019d say it\u2019s at best a partial response.Ultimately, what matters is not only how well you can collaborate in groups, but the quality of the mind you bring to the group. In rightly playing up soft skills the movie underemphasizes intellectual virtues. For example, it ignores the distinction between information processing, which computers are good at, and knowledge, which they are not.If we want to produce wise people, what are the stages that produce it? First, there is basic factual acquisition. You have to know what a neutron or a gene is, that the Civil War came before the Progressive Era. Research shows that students with a concrete level of core knowledge are better at remembering advanced facts and concepts as they go along.Second, there is pattern formation, linking facts together in meaningful ways. This can be done by a good lecturer, through class discussion, through unconscious processing or by going over and over a challenging text until it clicks in your head.Third, there is mental reformation. At some point while studying a field, the student realizes she has learned a new language and way of seeing \u2014 how to think like a mathematician or a poet or a physicist.At this point information has become knowledge. It is alive. It can be manipulated and rearranged. At this point a student has the mental content and architecture to innovate, to come up with new theses, challenge others\u2019 theses and be challenged in turn.Finally after living with this sort of knowledge for years, exposing it to the rigors of reality, wisdom dawns. Wisdom is a hard-earned intuitive awareness of how things will flow. Wisdom is playful. The wise person loves to share, and cajole and guide and wonder at what she doesn\u2019t know.The cathedrals of knowledge and wisdom are based on the foundations of factual acquisition and cultural literacy. You can\u2019t overleap that, which is what High Tech High is in danger of doing.\u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d is inspiring because it reminds us that the new technology demands new schools. But somehow relational skills have to be taught alongside factual literacy. The stairway from information to knowledge to wisdom has not changed. The rules have to be learned before they can be played with and broken.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Justices Seem Wary of Suit in Austrian Train Injury", "Date": "2015-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe woman, Carol P. Sachs, lost her legs after trying to board a moving train in Innsbruck. She said she should be allowed to sue the railroad in federal court in California because she had bought her Eurail pass in the United States over the Internet from a travel agent in Massachusetts.It was the first argument of the new term, and there was no evidence of the discord that marked the end of the last one in June. There was, rather, a seeming consensus that the case did not have enough to do with the United States to allow a lawsuit here.\u201cThere is one contact with the United States,\u201d said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an expert on jurisdiction. \u201cA pass is bought from a travel agent in Massachusetts, a pass covering 30-odd railroads. That\u2019s all that happened in the United States.\u201d\u201cAll of the relevant conduct, the tortious conduct, occurred abroad,\u201d she added.Justice Elena Kagan asked whether buying a ticket in the United States to an opera performance in Vienna would allow her to sue here if she slipped on a puddle and fell there. Her tone suggested that the idea was absurd.The precise legal question in the case was whether the railroad, which is owned by the Austrian government, was entitled to sovereign immunity. Foreign states are generally protected under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, but that law makes an exception for claims \u201cbased upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States.\u201dJeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for Ms. Sachs, said the sale of the rail pass was enough to satisfy the exception. \u201cThe overall integrated activity of running the railway train enterprise, which includes selling the product and delivering the product,\u201d sufficed, he said.Juan C. Basombrio, a lawyer for the railroad, said it would be impossible for the seller of a Eurail pass in the United States \u201cto warn about all conditions at hundreds of potential railroad stations in Europe.\u201dThe federal government supported the Austrian company on the crucial issue in the case, OBB Personenverkehr A.G. v. Sachs, No. 13-1067. Edwin S. Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general, urged the justices \u201cnot to draw U.S. courts into what could be very sensitive international questions of having U.S. courts pass judgment on what happens in a foreign country.\u201dMr. Fisher urged the court to consider the implications of its ruling. On one hand, \u201cyou\u2019ll never see a case like this again,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only in the railroad context, but even in the airline industry.\u201d That is because, he said, passes and tickets now routinely specify where suits may be brought.On the other hand, he went on, the court\u2019s ruling could apply to a lot of other types of disputes, including ones arising from financial transactions and employment agreements.Justice Ginsburg did not appear persuaded, saying the court could rule narrowly. \u201cThe question is, \u2018What does \u2018based on\u2019 mean\u201d in the immunities law? she said. \u201cAnd the court could say \u2018based on\u2019 is not based on if all that happened in the United States is the purchase of the ticket.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fact-Checking Republicans on Tax Plans", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016The Republican presidential candidates talked a lot about their tax plans at last week\u2019s debate, but most of the conversation was not very illuminating. Here are some details you may have missed about the candidates who did mention plans.Added up across the whole economy, Mr. Cruz\u2019s VAT would be equivalent to a very broadly based sales tax, applying even to services like health care that are ordinarily exempt from sales taxes. Like a sales tax, this tax would be built into prices and paid by consumers \u2014 and for many lower-income households, it would be a far greater burden than the income tax.The truth is that the Rubio plan offers the largest percentage increases in after-tax income to low earners, then the highest earners, with the smallest improvements for moderate earners \u2014 that is, both Mr. Rubio\u2019s answer and Mr. Harwood\u2019s question were correct. And this actually reflects a distinct feature of Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan: While all the Republican tax plans, including his, are generous to the highest earners, his plan is more focused on raising incomes for the poor and less on cutting taxes for the middle class.There is one caveat to all that generosity for low-income filers, though: Senator Rubio and Senator Lee have not yet hammered out precisely which low-income filers would qualify for their new, generous tax credits.Mr. Rubio\u2019s plan would greatly increase the budget deficit, unless offset by sharp federal government spending cuts that would have their own impacts on families\u2019 well-being. You\u2019d have to weigh those against the benefits of tax cuts. If these tax cuts were simply financed with government borrowing like the last round of Republican tax cuts, economists would generally expect that borrowing to slow economic growth, offsetting positive growth effects from the tax cuts themselves.Mr. Carson disclaimed that idea. \u201cWell, first of all, I didn\u2019t say that the rate would be 10 percent,\u201d he told Ms. Quick. Well, actually, he did. At the first Republican debate, he described the plan as follows: \u201cYou make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one.\u201d But anyway, Mr. Carson now doesn\u2019t think a 10 percent rate is workable, and said the rate would have to be closer to 15 percent.He argued: \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about an $18 trillion economy, you\u2019re talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You\u2019re talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.\u201dEssentially, he\u2019s saying, if the base is broad enough, a 15 percent tax will suffice. The main problem is his assumption that you can have a tax with a base equal to 100 percent of the economy. Some things are always tax exempt, for a mixture of good reasons and bad. We don\u2019t tax investment income earned by nonprofits like churches and universities, nor do we tax investment returns to pension funds and 401(k) retirement accounts. We don\u2019t tax income that people give away to charity. We don\u2019t tax employee health benefits. Most tax plans decline to tax at least some income for low earners; Mr. Cruz said his flat tax wouldn\u2019t apply to the first $36,000 of income for a family of four.It would be possible to have a tax base that is broader than today\u2019s, but it\u2019s unlikely Mr. Carson would succeed in getting it to 100 percent.He\u2019s betting on a healthy economic expansion, too, but he didn\u2019t disclose his exact assumptions.Advertisement"}

Russians might want to ask why young Russians are being sent to face mortal danger in the Middle East in service of Mr. Putin\u2019s very dangerous gamble.Propping up a flailing ally is only one of Mr. Putin\u2019s probable motives. He no doubt wants to flex his muscles (again) before a Russian public increasingly feeling the pain of a mismanaged economy and to deflect attention from the stalemate in Ukraine. But he may not be strutting for long.Syria is the proverbial quagmire. If the United States and its allies have failed either to create a viable opposition front or to eradicate the Islamic State, it is not only because of the limited effort but also because the tangle of insurgent groups, with their ever-shifting alliances, offer only an array of bad choices.By sending warplanes to bomb rebels, including those the United States has tried to shape into some semblance of an opposition, and now by sending in Russian soldiers, Mr. Putin stands to make matters far more complex. There is no assurance that his move will bring an end to the fighting any sooner.If Mr. Putin had ever been eager for peace, he could have exerted pressure on the Assad government before it stoked the civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians, driven millions from their homes and destroyed vast stretches of the country.Instead, he supported Mr. Assad and his brutal reprisals against civilians and the opposition, which opened up space for extremists to operate and expand, turning this war into a threat to the entire region. Even now, Mr. Putin could help by coordinating his actions with the West, but he seems entranced by the lure of making a grandstand play.It may not be too late for Mr. Putin to reconsider. The United States and its allies are in need of help and might well be open to cooperating with Russia on finding a combination of military and diplomatic measures that could curb the Islamic State and, more important, impose cease-fires that would give civilians some respite from the violence. That, ultimately, should be the priority for both the West and Russia. And it would certainly be a better way for Mr. Putin to satisfy his need for respect and a role in the Middle East.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Proud Skoda Owner to Chump Duped by VW", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter from EuropeLONDON \u2014 Full disclosure: I recently switched cars, and I feel like a chump.Mine is the new-style Skoda, built to German specifications with German innards, including its 2-liter diesel engine. Here in Britain it was blessed by no less an auto guru than Jeremy Clarkson on his car-review television show \u201cTop Gear.\u201dI was prepared for the inevitable mirth of owners of gas-guzzling BMWs, the chuckles and nudges as I parked my totem of Czech engineering alongside their echt-Deutsch wagons. I knew I would have the last laugh because my car, too, was underwritten by a company known for dependability, honesty, reliability. But my fuel bill would be lower, and my service charges, too. Volkswagen\u2019s word \u2014 articulated by Skoda \u2014 was its bond.Now, quite fortuitously, I know that my new car\u2019s engine is one of those 11 million that, according to Volkswagen, have been kitted out with software that enables it to detect when it is being tested and to return fraudulent results. Volkswagen has said that the software has been enabled on only about half of those cars.But I know mine is one of the enabled rogues because when I called the Skoda shop to book a repair job (someone had smashed a rear light while the car was parked on the street), I asked the clerk to check on my engine\u2019s status. He traced the vehicle identification number and said, yes, my car, a 2014 model, would need to be recalled and fixed at some stage, maybe by the end of the month.Neither Skoda nor Volkswagen has apprised me of this \u201cofficially.\u201d But I have no reason to disbelieve what the clerk told me. And the fact remains that the car I paid for was not the one I thought I was buying.This huge international scandal has left many drivers like me facing unsettling questions. Who will buy their used cars if they choose to sell? Should they drive them at all, until they know for certain what is coming out of the exhaust pipes? Will Volkswagen volunteer compensation or face down class-action lawsuits?Of equal concern, the whole imbroglio has played into an environmental debate that diesel drivers in particular were already losing. Just last weekend, Paris \u2014 about two-thirds of the cars on the road in France are diesels \u2014 closed off main thoroughfares to cars for a day of clean air. Other cities cannot be far behind. London already levies a congestion charge on vehicles entering the central area.The bombshell from Volkswagen left a crater quickly filled by representatives of the vocal lobbies advocating electric cars and bicycles. Diesel is the new devil \u2014 even though it is the same fuel that drivers had been encouraged to use because of its greater economy and lower carbon emissions.My new car is not simply a Skoda, but a model called the Skoda Yeti. It is named for the abominable snowman, the Bigfoot said to haunt the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush \u2014 a myth whose legend eclipses its reality. Quite literally, as it has turned out.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the make of the car. It is a Lada, not a Skoda Lada.Advertisement"}

Ser\u00eda el paso final para que Estados Unidos adopte el acuerdo m\u00e1s ambicioso desde el Tratado Norteamericano de Libre Comercio en 1994.El pacto est\u00e1 pensado como una estrategia para unir a los socios comerciales del Pac\u00edfico con Estados Unidos y al mismo tiempo, como un desaf\u00edo a China, la potencia en ascenso de Asia, que fue expl\u00edcitamente excluida de este acuerdo, al menos por ahora.Adem\u00e1s, el pacto es considerado como un veh\u00edculo para abordar numerosas cuestiones inconclusas que se han convertido en obst\u00e1culos a medida que despega el comercio mundial, como el comercio electr\u00f3nico, los servicios financieros y las comunicaciones por Internet transfronterizas.Tambi\u00e9n existen algunas cuestiones comerciales tradicionales. Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos est\u00e1 ansioso por establecer acuerdos formales de comercio con cinco de los pa\u00edses participantes, Jap\u00f3n, Malasia, Brunei, Nueva Zelanda y Vietnam, y reforzar el TNLC, su acuerdo vigente con Canad\u00e1 y M\u00e9xico.Aun m\u00e1s, como los esfuerzos en materia de comercio global han fallado (como la ronda de Doha organizada por la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de Comercio), el Acuerdo Transpac\u00edfico se presenta como un documento de \u201carquitectura abierta\u201d, redactado para facilitar su adopci\u00f3n por otros pa\u00edses asi\u00e1ticos y constituir un posible modelo para otras iniciativas que est\u00e1n en proceso, como la Alianza Transatl\u00e1ntica de Comercio e Inversi\u00f3n.Aranceles y cuotas. Los aranceles sobre las importaciones, que por mucho tiempo fueron utilizados para proteger la industria nacional de las mercanc\u00edas baratas del extranjero, sol\u00edan ser una caracter\u00edstica est\u00e1ndar de pol\u00edtica comercial, y generaron buena parte del ingreso de la Tesorer\u00eda de Estados Unidos en el siglo XIX. Despu\u00e9s de la depresi\u00f3n y de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Estados Unidos encabez\u00f3 el movimiento hacia un comercio m\u00e1s libre.Hoy en d\u00eda, Estados Unidos y la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses desarrollados tienen pocos aranceles, pero todav\u00eda quedan algunos. Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos protege su mercado interno de az\u00facar de proveedores extranjeros m\u00e1s baratos e impone tambi\u00e9n aranceles sobre los zapatos importados. Jap\u00f3n, por su parte, pone fuerte recargos a los productos agr\u00edcolas, en particular el arroz, la carne de res y los l\u00e1cteos.Aunque han dejado en claro que ven al pacto como parte de un esfuerzo por contrarrestar la influencia china en la regi\u00f3n, los funcionarios estadounidenses dicen tener la esperanza de que la \u201carquitectura abierta del acuerdo genere inter\u00e9s por parte de China, junto con otras importantes potencias econ\u00f3micas de Asia, como Corea del Sur.El TNLC (Nafta), firmado por el presidente Bill Clinton en 1993, ayud\u00f3 a producir un auge en el comercio entre Estados Unidos, Canad\u00e1 y M\u00e9xico. Los tres pa\u00edses exportaron m\u00e1s bienes y servicios a los otros dos, crecieron las inversiones transfronterizas y la econom\u00eda de Estados Unidos ha ganado millones de empleos desde entonces. Pero, por supuesto, no todas las tendencias pueden atribuirse al TNLC y los beneficios no son equitativos: Estados Unidos tuvo un peque\u00f1o excedente comercial con M\u00e9xico reci\u00e9n firmado el pacto, pero eso no tard\u00f3 en convertirse en un d\u00e9ficit que ha crecido a m\u00e1s de 50.000 millones de d\u00f3lares al a\u00f1o.Los cr\u00edticos del TNLC dicen que los empleos ganados en Estados Unidos no compensan los que se han ido a M\u00e9xico y a Canad\u00e1. La federaci\u00f3n sindical AFL-CIO alega que se han perdido o desplazado unos 700.000 empleos a causa del TNLC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Few Rivals as Hillary Clinton Still Leads", "Date": "2015-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 If you had asked any oddsmaker in January to pick the most likely next American president, Hillary Rodham Clinton would have been the overwhelming choice.Since then, Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, has had a dreadful year, rivaled in political misery only by Jeb Bush, Rand Paul and a few other Republican contenders who had to drop out.Nonetheless, if you asked those oddsmakers the same question today, on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate, the answer still would be Mrs. Clinton.This time, however, that assessment wouldn\u2019t reflect her strength, but rather the lack of a strong alternative at this stage. Even Democrats worried about her general election prospects \u2014 a growing population \u2014 dismiss the possibility of her rival Bernie Sanders winning the nomination.And they are skeptical that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will run or, if he did jump in, that he would win. The Republicans are in such chaos that a pathway to victory appears elusive.Yet looking at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s problems, and some of her less-often-cited promise, suggests how on the mark those odds may be.Her reaction to the controversy over the use of her private email system is widely viewed as cavalier and clumsy, a case study in arrogance and poor political instincts. There is little evidence yet of a smoking gun, and the House Republicans\u2019 Benghazi investigative committee, before which she will testify next week, is struggling to counter the impression that it is a partisan assault rather than a fact-gathering exercise.Yet she has taken a hit in the polls; voters don\u2019t like revisiting the trials and tribulations of Clintonland.The campaign makes surprising blunders, leaking stories about tactics \u2014 Hillary will offer a softer image \u2014 or her electoral firewalls.Democratic professionals say that, in contrast to her last presidential campaign, she has strong leadership with John Podesta as chief executive and Robby Mook as campaign manager or chief operating officer. Privately, however, there is concern that crisis management sometimes comes down to a small coterie of personal intimates, her daughter, Chelsea, and Huma Abedin, a longtime aide and surrogate daughter.Still, there are also encouraging signs for Clinton supporters. After stiffing the news media for the first part of her campaign, Mrs. Clinton has done well in a series of recent interviews. She hates the press but does better when she engages.No campaign has offered more substance, even if it was overshadowed by the email contretemps. To be sure, some of this is politically calculated: Her biggest threat would be losing the first few nominating contests to Mr. Sanders, so her campaign is determined to protect the left flank.She still faces criticism for political pandering. She announced last week that she opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement involving the United States and 11 other countries \u2014 which encompass 40 percent of the global economy. But she had long supported such a pact, and even her supporters said the stated rationale for opposition was specious and could raise more questions about her credibility.There\u2019s a lot of real meat elsewhere. No one has offered a more comprehensive proposal to deal with the crushing debt imposed on many families by the costs of college. The same holds for her proposals to establish a sliding-scale capital gains tax rate, her focus on longer-term economics, and initiatives to give financial regulators more powers and to impose a \u201crisk fee\u201d on big banks.These offerings have drawn fire from the left and the right. But the financial measures were carefully crafted: She consulted experts including top Wall Street executives and former Representative Barney Frank. Her July remarks on \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d was one of the best economic speeches of this political season. The two big tests she faces over the next 10 days \u2014 the debate and the Benghazi hearings \u2014 are opportunities to reaffirm the current odds and overcome much of this year\u2019s self-inflicted damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks on Not Running for President", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. President, thank you for lending me the Rose Garden for a minute.I know from previous experience that there is no timetable for this process. The process doesn\u2019t respect or much care about things like filing deadlines or debates and primaries and caucuses. But I also know that I could do this if \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do this if the family wasn\u2019t ready. The good news is the family has reached that point. But as I\u2019ve said many times, my family has suffered a loss and I hope there would come a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this to many other families \u2014 that sooner rather than later, when you think of your loved one it brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes. Well, that\u2019s where the Bidens are today \u2014 thank God. Beau is our inspiration.Unfortunately, I believe we\u2019re out of time \u2014 the time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination. But while I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.And this is what I believe. I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we\u2019re now on the cusp of resurgence. I\u2019m proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy. The American people have worked too hard and we\u2019ve come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record, they should run on the record.We\u2019ve got a lot of work to get done over the next 15 months, and there\u2019s a lot that the president will have to get done. But let me be clear that we\u2019ll be building on a really solid foundation. But it all starts with giving the middle class a fighting chance.I know you in the press love to call me \u201cMiddle-Class Joe\u201d and I know in Washington that\u2019s not usually meant as a compliment \u2014 it means you\u2019re not that sophisticated. But it is about the middle class. It isn\u2019t just a matter of fairness or economic growth. It\u2019s a matter of social stability for this nation. We cannot sustain the current levels of inequality that exist in this country.I believe the huge sums of unlimited and often secret money pouring into our politics is a fundamental threat to our democracy. And I really mean that. I think it\u2019s a fundamental threat. Because the middle class will never have a fighting chance in this country as long as just several hundred families, the wealthiest families, control the process. It\u2019s just that simple.And I believe we have to level the playing field for the American people. And that\u2019s going to take access to education and opportunity to work. We need to commit \u2014 we\u2019re fighting for 14 years \u2014 we need to commit to 16 years of free public education for all our children. We all know that 12 years of public education is not enough. As a nation, let\u2019s make the same commitment to a college education today that we made to a high school education a hundred years ago.Children and child care is the one, biggest barrier for working families. We need, as the president proposed, to triple the child care tax credit. That alone will lead to a dramatic increase in the number of women able to be in the work force and will raise our economic standards. There are many equitable ways to pay for this. Often you hear, well, how do you pay for this? There are many equitable ways to pay for this. We could pay for all of this with one simple step \u2014 by limiting the deductions in the tax code to 28 percent of income. Wealthy folks will end up paying a little bit more. But it\u2019s my guess \u2014 and I mean this sincerely \u2014 it\u2019s my guess they\u2019ll be happy to help build a stronger economy and a better educated America.I believe we need to lead more by the power of our example, as the president has, than merely by the example of our power. We\u2019ve learned some very hard lessons from more than a decade of large-scale, open-ended military invasions. We have to accept the fact that we can\u2019t solve all the world\u2019s problems \u2014 we can\u2019t solve many of them \u2014 alone. The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons\u2019 and daughters\u2019 lives on the line, put them at risk.I believe we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart. And I think we can. It\u2019s meanspirited. It\u2019s petty. And it\u2019s gone on for much too long. I don\u2019t believe, like some do, that it\u2019s na\u00efve to talk to Republicans. I don\u2019t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition; they\u2019re not our enemies. And for the sake of the country, we have to work together.As the president said many times, compromise is not a dirty word. Look at it this way, folks \u2014 how does this country function without consensus? How can we move forward without being able to arrive at consensus? Four more years of this kind of pitched battle may be more than this country can take. We have to change it. We have to change it.And I believe we need a moonshot in this country to cure cancer. It\u2019s personal. But I know we can do this. The president and I have already been working hard on increasing funding for research and development \u2014 because there are so many breakthroughs just on the horizon in science and medicine. The things that are just about to happen, we can make them real with an absolute national commitment to end cancer as we know it today. And I\u2019m going to spend the next 15 months in this office pushing as hard as I can to accomplish this. Because I know there are Democrats and Republicans on the Hill who share our passion \u2014 our passion to silence this deadly disease. If I could be anything, I would want it to be the president that ended cancer, because it\u2019s possible.I also believe we need to keep moving forward in the arc of this nation toward justice \u2014 the rights of the LGBT community, immigration reform, equal pay for women and protecting their safety from violence, rooting out institutional racism. At their core, every one of these things \u2014 every one of these things is about the same thing. It\u2019s about equality. It\u2019s about fairness. It\u2019s about respect. As my dad used to say, it\u2019s about affording every single person dignity. It\u2019s not complicated. Every single one of these issues is about dignity.And the ugly forces of hate and division, they won\u2019t let up, but they do not represent the American people. They do not represent the heart of this country. They represent a small fraction of the political elite. And the next president is going to have to take it on.Most of all, I believe there\u2019s unlimited possibilities for this country. I don\u2019t know how many of the White House staff and personnel have heard me say repeatedly that we are so much better positioned than any country in the world. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. When I got elected as a 29-year-old kid, I was called the optimist. I am more optimistic about the possibilities, the incredible possibilities to leap forward than I have been at any time in my career. And I believe in my core that there\u2019s not country on the face of the Earth better positioned to lead the world in the 21st century than the United States of America.Washington just has to begin to function again. Instead of being the problem, it has to become part of the solution \u2014 again. We have to be one America \u2014 again.And at our core, I\u2019ve always believed that what sets America apart from every other nation is that we, ordinary Americans, believe in possibilities \u2014 unlimited possibilities. Possibilities for a kid growing up in a poor inner-city neighborhood, or a Spanish-speaking home, or a kid from Mayfield in Delaware, or Willow Grove in Pennsylvania \u2014 like Jill and I. To be able to be anything we want it to be; to do anything \u2014 anything \u2014 that we want, that\u2019s what we were both taught. That\u2019s what the president was taught. It was real. That\u2019s what I grew up believing. And, you know, it\u2019s always been true in this country. And if we ever lose that, we\u2019ve lost something very special. We\u2019ll have lost the very soul of this country.When I was growing up, my parents, in tough times, looked at me and would say to me and my brothers and sister, \u201cHoney, it\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d And they meant it. They meant it. It was going to be O.K. But some of you who cover me, I say go back to your old neighborhoods. Talk to your contemporaries who aren\u2019t as successful as you\u2019ve been. There are too many people in America today, too many parents who don\u2019t believe they can look their kid in the eye and say with certitude, \u201cHoney, it\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d That\u2019s what we need to change. It\u2019s not complicated.That will be the true measure of our success. And we\u2019ll not have met it until every parent out there can look at their kid in tough times and say, \u201cHoney, it\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d \u2014 and mean it. That\u2019s our responsibility. And I believe it\u2019s totally within our power. The nation has done it before in difficult times.I\u2019ve had the very great, good fortune and privilege of being in public service most of my adult life, since I\u2019ve been 25 years old. And through personal triumphs and tragedies, my entire family \u2014 my son Beau, my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, Jill \u2014 our whole family \u2014 and this sounds corny \u2014 but we found purpose in public life. We found purpose in public life. So we intend, the whole family \u2014 not just me \u2014 we intend to spend the next 15 months fighting for what we\u2019ve always cared about, what my family has always care about, with every ounce of our being. And working alongside the president and members of Congress and our future nominee, I am absolutely certain we are fully capable of accomplishing extraordinary things.We can do this. And when we do, America won\u2019t just win the future, we will own the finish line.Thank you for all being so gracious to Jill and me for the last six or eight months \u2014 and for our whole career, for that matter. But I\u2019m telling you, we can do so much more. And I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to work with this man to get it done.Thank you all very much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Exploding Pension Crisis Feeds Brazil\u2019s Political Turmoil", "Date": "2015-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 When Ros\u00e2ngela Ara\u00fajo turned 44, she decided that she had worked long enough.So Ms. Ara\u00fajo, a public school supervisor, did what millions of others in their 40s and 50s have done in this country: She retired, with a full pension.\u201cI had to take advantage of the benefit that was available to me,\u201d said Ms. Ara\u00fajo, now 65. Her government pension stands at about $1,000 a month, five times the minimum wage.Brazilians retire at an average age of 54, and some public servants, military officials and politicians manage to collect multiple pensions totaling well over $100,000 year. Then, once they die, loopholes enable their spouses or daughters to go on collecting the pensions for the rest of their lives, too.\u201cThink Greece, but on a crazier, more colossal scale,\u201d said Paulo Tafner, an economist and a leading authority on Brazil\u2019s pension system. \u201cThe entire country should be frightened to its core. The pensions Brazilians obtain and the ages at which they start receiving them are nothing less than scandalous.\u201dStill, economists warn that the pension crisis will grow more acute regardless of whether Ms. Rousseff stays in office, ranking it among Brazil\u2019s most vexing structural binds. Officials had expected a major shortfall in 2030, but they now say that could happen as soon as next year.Then there is Brazil\u2019s plummeting fertility rate \u2014 which recently dropped to 1.77 children per woman, below the rate needed for the population to replace itself \u2014 which will eventually put even more pressure on a pension system already under intense strain.This shift partly reflects higher living standards in recent decades and broader availability of birth control, but it will result in fewer young people to support a much larger older population. As recently as 1980, Brazil\u2019s fertility rate was 4.3 children per woman, according to the United Nations.And the average life expectancy in Brazil has climbed to 74.9 years in 2013, from 62.5 years in 1980, according to government statistics. Instead of building a surplus now to prepare for an onslaught of new pension obligations, scholars say, Brazil is squandering a demographic bonus that will soon fade.Economists note that Brazil already spends more than 10 percent of its gross domestic product on public pensions, similar to what southern European countries with much older populations have recently spent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Unless changes are made, an even bigger shock is expected here, given that the population of people 60 or older is expected to reach about 14 percent of the overall population in just two decades, up from about 7 percent now.But the biggest challenge that political leaders across the ideological spectrum face is one they helped create: the generosity of Brazilian pensions.Some authorities have occasionally taken a stab at the issue, trying to raise the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women, prevent young widows from easily receiving their deceased husbands\u2019 pensions, or stop many in the private sector from receiving their full salaries as public pensions.But loopholes flourish, making it relatively easy for Brazilians to retire much younger, often with public pensions equivalent to their full salaries. Brazilian men now retire at an average age of 55, while men in Greece retire on average at the age of 63. The pension system can ease extreme poverty. For instance, rural workers can retire five years before others even if they have never contributed to the public pension system, receiving a monthly payment equal to the minimum wage, about $210 a month.But the system also perpetuates inequality by providing special benefits to hundreds of thousands of government employees and their families.In 2000, for instance, officials did away with rules allowing the daughters of military officials to receive the pensions of their fathers after they died. But the shift applied only to new entrants into the armed forces, so more than 185,000 women still draw military survivors\u2019 pensions, often amounting to the full salaries of their fathers upon retirement. Spending on such pensions is forecast to last through the end of this century, economists say.This kind of benefit is widespread enough throughout the public bureaucracy that Brazil is estimated to spend about 3 percent of its gross domestic product on survivors\u2019 pensions, about three times the level in many rich industrialized countries.Politicians have been especially skilled at securing big pensions at the state level. In the Amazonian state of Par\u00e1, former governors and first ladies were recently receiving lifelong pensions as high as $7,000 a month, even if they served only a few years in office. Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Tribunal suspended such pensions this year.But other states are struggling with similar payouts. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, the authorities had relied on royalties from offshore oil production before oil prices fell sharply in recent months. Officials in Rio are now preparing a bailout to transfer about $500 million from the state treasury to cover this year\u2019s shortfall in the pension system.With Rio\u2019s pension obligations soaring, that means fewer resources for basic services like schools, hospitals, policing and sewage systems. Rio is planning to spend about $4.5 billion this year on pension benefits, compared with about $3.6 billion on the state\u2019s public education and health systems, officials said.\u201cBrazil has three very clear options to prevent large increases in pension spending: Increase contributions, increase the retirement age, or decrease pensions,\u201d said Mariano Bosch, a labor markets specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank. \u201cAll of those options are very unpopular.\u201dWell-organized pensioners\u2019 unions are rejecting calls to scale back benefits.\u201cMaking retirees pay the price is just not fair,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Pimenta, 63, a former director of a shopkeepers\u2019 association who retired at age 49 and regularly leads protests against pension cuts in Brazil\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the economic elite being called upon to sacrifice? I\u2019m sick of hearing that normal people need to pay the price with their pensions.\u201dSome analysts hope that Brazil\u2019s political battles can open the way for pension solutions. But others say that the crisis may actually have the opposite effect by emboldening Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents in Congress who are aggressively seeking to expand pension benefits.If Ms. Rousseff is ousted, political analysts point out, her governing Workers\u2019 Party would move into the opposition, potentially encouraging it to mobilize the same unions that view overhauling the pension system as an abomination.\u201cPublic pensions in Brazil have long been a slow-motion disaster,\u201d said Raul Velloso, a specialist on public finances. \u201cThe difference now is that the debacle is accelerating, revealing to our children the political cowardice and irresponsibility our leaders are bestowing on them.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oh, Those Debating Republicans", "Date": "2015-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn his way into the big presidential debate, Ben Carson told reporters his plan was \u201cto be me.\u201d Excellent idea \u2014 way better than planning to be Chris Christie.\u201cWe are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job!\u201d cried Gov. John Kasich of Ohio at the moment the contest began. Kasich had actually been asked to name his biggest weakness, but the thought of Carson\u2019s tax plan and Donald Trump\u2019s immigration plan seemed to send him a little off topic.\u201cHe was so nice, he was such a nice guy,\u201d sneered Trump at Kasich\u2019s howling. \u201cBut then his poll numbers tanked.\u201dHard to believe the race is still barely beginning \u2014 one week until one year until presidential Election Day! But you can\u2019t say things have been boring. \u201cWhat the hell are you people doing to me?\u201d Trump demanded in Iowa, where he\u2019s no longer in the lead. Perhaps we will look back on this as the moment when the former star of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d fired a state.But about Wednesday night\u2019s debate \u2014 the topic was economics, and the big takeaway was probably that when there are 10 people onstage, nobody is going to have to explain how that flat tax plan adds up. When in doubt, complain about government regulations.Carson appears to have a particular genius on this front. Asked what to do about the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s outrageous pricing policies, he mildly said: \u201cNo question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits,\u201d and then he careened off to the cost of government rules on \u201cthe average small manufacturer.\u201dEvery seasoned politician is good at answering a difficult question with the answer to something entirely different. But Carson \u2014 who isn\u2019t supposed to be a politician at all \u2014 was possibly the champ. Where do you think he picked that up? It\u2019s a little unnerving to think this kind of talent is useful in the operating room.Because Carson\u2019s voice always sounds so moderate, responses that make no sense whatsoever can sound sort of thoughtful until you replay them in your head. Asked why, as an opponent of gay marriage, he serves on the board of a company that offers domestic partner benefits, Carson said that he believed \u201cmarriage is between one man and one woman and there is no reason that you can\u2019t be perfectly fair to the gay community.\u201d He then proposed, in his measured tones, that \u201cthe P.C. culture \u2026 it\u2019s destroying this nation.\u201dRepublicans who have been terrified by Trump and Carson, and in despair over Jeb Bush, keep pointing hopefully to Marco Rubio. During the debate, Rubio demonstrated great verbal talent when it came to explaining why he seems so bad at things like, say, managing his personal finances. (His parents were humble working folk who did not leave him a fortune.) Also, his stupendous absentee record in the Senate is not all that much worse than some other people who have run for president.\u201cBut Marco, when you signed up for this \u2014 this was a six-year term and you should be showing up to work,\u201d interjected Bush, who seemed as if he had suddenly shaken himself from a nap. Bush\u2019s only two moments of energy involved Rubio, who he seems to hate, and fantasy football, which he really, really enjoys.Jeb Bush is not going to be the Republican presidential nominee. Neither is, let\u2019s see \u2014 Christie, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina or any of the other supporting cast members. Ted Cruz did have a big moment when he answered a question about raising the debt limit by attacking the questioner. That went over so well that by the end of the two-hour session, the left-wing media had overtaken government regulators as the greatest threat to the future of American democracy.Or do you think it could actually be Carson? The guy who seems to blame gun control for the Holocaust?One of the theories on why Carson can\u2019t win \u2014 besides the fact that he\u2019s utterly loopy \u2014 is that even a lot of Republican voters will be unnerved by his plans to undermine Social Security and Medicare. But his ideas aren\u2019t actually all that different from those of most of the other candidates, who want to raise retirement rates or cut out everybody under, say, 45. \u201cIt\u2019s not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us,\u201d said Rubio.Hard to imagine this going over well in middle-aged America, but the whole party is on the same page. Except for Mike Huckabee who \u2014 yes! \u2014 is still in the race, out there somewhere. And Trump, who says everything will be fine after he makes \u201ca really dynamic economy from what we have right now\u201d and builds that wall at the border.Somebody has got to be nominated. Happy Halloween.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Putin Winning?", "Date": "2015-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONCE again, Vladimir Putin is on the move in ways the Obama White House did not anticipate. Once again, American foreign policy analysts can\u2019t agree on whether he\u2019s acting out of brilliance or desperation.The curious reality is that these interpretations are not mutually exclusive, because whether Putin is \u201cwinning\u201d depends on how you define success.You can argue that he\u2019s been playing a bad hand well, but his cards still look considerably worse than they did when oil prices were higher, or after his splendid little war with Georgia in 2008.And even his somewhat successful plays highlight the extent to which Russian power remains atrophied compared to its Cold War past. The front line of Russian aggression in Eastern Europe is territory that Moscow once ruled with ease, and even there Putin has to settle for stalemates. His Middle Eastern foray is inevitably limited; even after a major defense buildup, Russia is hardly positioned to lead a sweeping military campaign far from its own territory.American hawks fear a repeat of Putin\u2019s Crimea gambit in the Baltic States, which are certainly vulnerable to Russian mischief. But there, too, Putin would be playing for slivers of territory in his own backyard, while probably reaping domestic backlash and further weakening an already-weakened economic hand. A Russia that can\u2019t control what happens in Kiev is not exactly poised to dominate Eastern Europe; Hungary 1956 or Czechoslovakia 1968 this is not.But suppose we judge Putin\u2019s maneuvers by a different standard: Not whether they\u2019re delivering ever-greater-influence to Moscow, but whether they\u2019re weakening the Pax Americana and the major institutions (NATO, the E.U.) of the post-Cold War West.On this metric, the Russian leader is having more success. His annexation of Crimea, for instance, saddled Moscow with all kinds of near-term and long-term problems. But it established a meaningful precedent regarding the limits of American and Western power, a kind of counterexample to the first gulf war, by proving that recognized borders can still be redrawn by military force.To be clear: Putin is a Russian nationalist, not the leader of Spectre or the League of Shadows. He doesn\u2019t want chaos for its own sake, and he no doubt believes that a weakened NATO, a divided E.U. and a crumbling Pax Americana are necessary preconditions for his own empire\u2019s return to greatness.But that return seems far out of his reach, and what\u2019s closer to his grasp is something more destructive \u2014 a wrecker\u2019s legacy, not Peter the Great\u2019s, in which his own people gain little from his efforts, but the world grows more unstable with every move he makes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "East Jerusalem, Bubbling Over With Despair", "Date": "2015-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 East Jerusalem, long the emotional heart of Palestinian life, is now the fiery soul of its discontent.It is not just that most of the young people suspected in this month\u2019s spate of stabbing attacks came from within the city borders, like the 18-year-old college student whose residency is being revoked by Israel after the police said she stabbed a Jewish man in the back. It is that her neighborhood of 18,000, Sur Baher, is also home to people like Fuad Abu Hamed, a successful businessman who condemns the wave of violence but shares the frustration and alienation underlying this new uprising.Mr. Abu Hamed, 44, is a lecturer at Hebrew University who runs two clinics in Israel\u2019s health system, and lives in a comfortable home among Sur Baher\u2019s tangle of crowded hills. The view from his balcony is of sprawling Jewish enclaves that he said were \u201cbuilt on our lands,\u201d and the ugly barrier Israel erected that splits Sur Baher from the occupied West Bank. These days, he can also see the Israeli soldiers who have blocked two of the neighborhood\u2019s exits and set up a checkpoint to search cars at the third, making the city\u2019s psychic division all the more concrete.\u201cYou have a lot of evidence that you are not a human being,\u201d Mr. Abu Hamed said. \u201cThe problem is the policy, because all the time as a Palestinian here you feel that they want to take you out of the city, you have a lot of problems that do not allow you to feel that you are part of the city. It\u2019s killing from inside all the time.\u201dIn East Jerusalem, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is most personal and most profound. For Israeli Jews, the outbreak of seemingly random attacks by Palestinians is both a vexing challenge to contain and a reminder of the inherent conundrum in their vision of a united Jerusalem.For many of the 320,000 Arab residents, the violence is a consequence of years of feeling like the neglected stepchildren of both City Hall and the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the West Bank and is barred from operating in Jerusalem. They do not feel wanted here, or part of what is happening there.Civic and cultural institutions decamped years ago for the West Bank city of Ramallah. In Arab East Jerusalem, there are too few classrooms, and too many dropouts. It is difficult to get a permit to expand a home; 98 illegal structures were demolished last year. Three-quarters of the population lives below Israel\u2019s poverty line.These Palestinians are regular visitors to the contested holy site in the Old City where fears of an Israeli takeover have helped fuel the violent outbreak. They speak Hebrew and, unlike their brethren in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, residency means they can work and travel throughout Israel as do citizens \u2014 giving them an intimate, daily view of all they do not have.Even as they benefit from Israel\u2019s robust economy, many seethe as they pump gas or stock shelves for better-off Jewish peers.\u201cOn the one hand, yes, you have open access to Israeli society \u2014 on the other hand you also have more knowledge about the discrimination that\u2019s being practiced against you,\u201d said Sari Nusseibeh, the former president of Al Quds University. \u201cMajor issues that you identify with as a Palestinian and a Muslim, your dignity and self-respect, your position, your role, these are in total and constant conflict.\u201dYehuda Yemini, who spent 15 years working in East Jerusalem for Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security agency, blamed \u201ctoxic incitement\u201d that riddled textbooks in local schools until a few years ago.\u201cYou get a generation that has grown up with the messages that a Jew is someone who comes to harm us, and endangers our religion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven those who define themselves as secular have a lot of religious motifs. And there is a conflict between the modern, dynamic Israel they see and the narrative of the evil Israel that won\u2019t succeed.\u201dIsrael captured it all from Jordan in the 1967 war, and expanded Jerusalem\u2019s boundaries to 27 square miles from 2.3. Israel\u2019s annexation was rejected by the United Nations, and most of the world considers the territory occupied. Today, 200,000 Jews live beyond Israel\u2019s original border, most in new developments \u2014 widely considered illegal settlements \u2014 like those Mr. Abu Hamed can see from his balcony, 2,000 scattered amid the Palestinian enclaves.Israeli leaders claim the entire expanse as their undivided capital. Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. International road maps for peace imagine Palestinian control of Arab areas and Israeli control of Jewish ones, with a special arrangement for the Old City and its surroundings.Rafat Sub-Laban, 27, who lives in the Old City\u2019s Muslim quarter, said Palestinians in Jerusalem \u201chave sort of a schizophrenic feeling.\u201d \u201cIn Jerusalem now, the night life is filled with bats,\u201d Mr. Nusseibeh lamented.Zakaria Al-Qaq, an Al Quds professor who traces his roots in Jerusalem back 1,400 years, said that Ramallah had abandoned the city, with leaders invoking it as a \u201ctoken\u201d but doing nothing to solve day-to-day problems.\u201cTheir words don\u2019t go into deeds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe society is in turmoil, internally, they are fighting with each other, there\u2019s no law and order.\u201d The protest, he added, \u201cis not limited to the Israelis.\u201dMayor Nir Barkat of Jerusalem boasts that he has made unprecedented investments in East Jerusalem: 800 new classrooms, $130 million on infrastructure, and a $1.8 million community center in Sur Baher.Israel officially offers citizenship to all Jerusalem Palestinians, but a tiny fraction apply. Now, as part of Israel\u2019s crackdown, the interior minister is taking the rare step of revoking the residency of the college student from Sur Baher and 16 other alleged attackers \u2014 plus the citizenship of two more. They would still be able to live in the city, but would lose all social-welfare benefits and would need to renew visas every few months. In Sur Baher, residents said the line of cars at the lone remaining exit on Thursday morning stretched for hundreds of yards. Moussa Dabash, 44, who runs a tour-bus company, said he was searched under his shirt and between his legs.\u201cIf I say a word, they\u2019ll accuse me of trying to stab them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe soldier who searched me, I told him, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because you are terrorists.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Abu Hamed, too, said he was delayed. But his complaints are more fundamental than a temporary checkpoint.A couple and their two children died in a fire last year, he said, because engines are dispatched to Sur Baher from another Palestinian neighborhood rather than from the closer Jewish ones. He petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court in 1999 to demand a girls\u2019 school in Sur Baher, and won, but says the neighborhood now needs 20 schools, not the current 13. The trash hauling bins down the road are overflowing, something he never sees when he goes to pay taxes on the other side of town.Yes, Mr. Abu Hamed and his neighbors can fly from Israel\u2019s airport, a privilege denied to those in the West Bank or Gaza. But he said he never makes it through security \u201cwithout crying,\u201d because his Hebrew University ID card \u201cmeans nothing \u2014 I am a Palestinian in the end.\u201d Irit Pazner Garshowitz, Isabel Kershner and Said Ghazali contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Region Disturbed by Ethnic Tensions, China Keeps Tight Lid on a Massacre ", "Date": "2015-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of the victims were Han Chinese who had been lured to this desolate corner of the far west Xinjiang region by the prospect of steady work and decent pay.Even as Baicheng County remains in a state of siege, with an enormous manhunt underway, the Chinese news media has yet to report on the massacre, and local officials, when asked about it, have denied that it even took place.But the attack on the Sogan coal mine appears to be one of the deadliest acts of violence in Xinjiang in recent years, underscoring the challenges that Beijing faces as it tries to maintain order in a region nearly as large as Alaska.Last week, the county seat was bristling with heavily armed police officers and was subject to a nighttime curfew. At main intersections, officers huddled behind sandbags; at Baicheng County Hospital, they guarded the rooms of the half-dozen injured mine workers yet to be discharged.A middle school in nearby Tirek Township has been converted into a staging area, and residents say that a helicopter and drones have been flying over the deeply carved ravines that are thought to be sheltering the killers.Despite the siege atmosphere, many Baicheng residents said they knew little about what had happened at the coal mine. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything, and we feel safer if it stays that way,\u201d the desk clerk of a local hotel said with a shrug and a smile.Lingering across from her in the lobby was a group of special forces officers, intimidating with their black uniforms and hard expressions. They had been called from other parts of China, and another hotel clerk suggested that they had replaced local officers whose loyalties could not be entirely trusted.\u201cWe have many Uighur police in Baicheng, and sometimes they might just cut people some slack if they are of the same ethnicity,\u201d said the clerk, Xiong Zhaoxia, 27, a native of southwest Sichuan Province who moved here as a child. \u201cJust think about it,\u201d she added, \u201cif I go back to my hometown, the people there will surely help me hide.\u201dEven if untrue, her sentiments speak volumes about the mistrust between the Han Chinese and the Uighurs. The two ethnic groups have little in common, and they often cannot speak the same language, especially in rural areas.The resentment among Uighurs, palpable beneath the taut smiles and platitudes about ethnic unity, is fueled by widespread poverty, government restrictions on religious activities and a belief that Han outsiders benefit disproportionately from Xinjiang\u2019s plentiful natural resources, which include 40 percent of the nation\u2019s coal deposits and a quarter of its oil reserves.\u201cSometimes when I look around me and see so many Han, I feel like I am a stranger in my own homeland,\u201d said a Uighur engineer in Aksu, the prefectural capital, which was once predominantly Uighur but whose population is now half Han.Local officials, mindful of how social unrest can hobble careers, may be worried about angering higher-ups in Beijing. But one Communist Party official interviewed by Radio Free Asia provided another reason for the media blackout: \u201cWe are controlling information about the incident so strictly, lest we frighten Han migrants in Aksu,\u201d he said.A man who answered the telephone at the Baicheng government\u2019s offices hung up when asked about what had happened at the mine. Ma Yanfeng, an official charged with managing foreign visitors to Aksu, said he knew nothing about the attack, but expressed no evident concern when told the grisly details. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that the different ethnic groups in Aksu live together in absolute harmony,\u201d he said, spreading his arms wide for effect.The government invariably blames Muslim religious extremists for the violence, though analysts outside China say many attacks have little to do with jihadist ideology. \u201cThe triggers are often locally embedded, whether it be reprisal for a woman who\u2019s been publicly unveiled, and her family shamed, or people striking back after a relative has been detained by police,\u201d said James Leibold, a professor of Asian studies at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, who is an expert on Xinjiang.Residents said they saw faces of several young women on wanted posters at Baicheng\u2019s main market. The posters were later removed; it is not known why.At the county hospital, relatives of the injured workers were reluctant to talk to a reporter, but one man, who gave his surname, Liu, said the government was paying the medical bills for his brother-in-law, a native of Sichuan whose hand was slashed during the attack.Outside on Jiefang Lu, or Liberation Street, the town\u2019s main commercial thoroughfare, lampposts were festooned with posters hailing Xinjiang\u2019s 60th anniversary and placards condemning terrorism. One billboard featured a multiethnic clutch of citizens, cartoonish figures armed with shovels and brooms, attacking rats. \u201cFellow ethnicities unite and jointly combat violent terrorists,\u201d it said.It was midday, but many storefronts along the street were shuttered. Ms. Xiong, the hotel clerk, said many shop owners had left over the past year or so, joining an exodus of Han migrants who departed after some of Baicheng\u2019s cement plants, steel factories and coal mines closed down, victims of China\u2019s slowing economy.\u201cNow, with this incident, I think the companies and businessmen will never come back,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And it is not a frivolous observation. Dismiss it as north of the border tomfoolery and miss a trick.Hair has not played such a big part in a political contest as far back as I can remember. It puts the flurry of conversation around Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s do-switcheroos, John Edwards\u2019s $400 cut and Mitt Romney\u2019s crowning glory in the shade.And it suggests that, like it or not, in a social media world where humor and pictures have a very real power, successful candidates need to be clever enough to use them strategically, lest they be used by others against them.\u201cEach of the candidates had a very distinct look,\u201d Ms. Brandon said, explaining why Hill & Knowlton chose hair as communications semiology. \u201cAs soon as you saw the hair, you knew exactly which leader was being referenced.\u201dIndeed, as much as anything over the last 78 days, hair came to stand for each candidate: Mr. Trudeau, called \u201chair apparent\u201d by the Economist in acknowledgment of the legacy of his father, the former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, as well as his lush brown curls; Stephen Harper, a.k.a. \u201cLego hair,\u201d thanks to his side-parted and immobile resemblance to the all-in-one toppers of the little plastic people; and Mr. Mulcair and his beard, itself an anomaly in a country that has not elected a bearded prime minister since 1896, when Mackenzie Bowell resigned.There\u2019s a lesson here to be learned. It starts back in May.Although Mr. Trudeau initially tried to rise above the hair thing, announcing (in response to the Conservative ad), \u201cI won\u2019t be talking about beards or hair,\u201d the New Democratic Party took the dare on its chin, releasing its own ad overtly satirizing the Conservative ad, with the same hair tagline applied to Mr. Harper.In the end, there was so much hair discussion that even the writer Margaret Atwood felt compelled to weigh in with a satirical op-ed piece in the National Post in August pointing out that Mr. Harper travels with a personal stylist and that maybe he shouldn\u2019t open that particular can of hair gel.Ridiculous? A distraction from the real subjects? Or a smart and humorous way to push the identification levers currently available via imagery and optics (Who doesn\u2019t have hair issues? Who can\u2019t relate to these stereotypes?) to create an instant narrative, one of alternative options, youth and difference?This is obviously not to say that a candidate doesn\u2019t need to focus on substance as well as style, but that poking fun at your own and others\u2019 carefully constructed image is not just a fig \u2014 sorry, maple \u2014 leaf. It\u2019s an effective part of the political arsenal. Republicans should take note.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the position to which Justin Trudeau was elected on Monday. The Canadian prime minister is that country\u2019s head of government, not its head of state. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of Canada, as well as of the 15 other countries in the British Commonwealth.Advertisement"}

Indeed, some jobs have gone overseas because it was cheaper to get the work done there. But not all jobs that American-based companies have put overseas have moved there from here, and many are there because they can\u2019t be anyplace else.There was a global economy in the mid-1960s, and jobs were developed overseas in order to get into overseas markets. Besides the obvious factors such as transportation costs and the need to be on the ground in that country, there was also protectionism in many third-world markets, and the only way to do business there was to be there.This is still true in many situations, but the arguments got politicized right out of the box. All of a sudden, the talk was about exporting jobs, rather than developing business overseas to replace exports, not jobs. The result has been a false argument that largely ignores the realities of how the world economy works.JIM BENNETTVenice, Fla.The writer is a corporate lawyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tacitly, Britain\u2019s Top Banker Makes Case for Staying in E.U.", "Date": "2015-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Britons may be divided on whether they should remain within the European Union, recent public opinion polls show, but many big players in business and finance appear to know their views \u2014 and they seem to want to stay in the bloc.On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, gave a positive, if cautious, assessment of British membership in the union, on which Britons will vote in a referendum by the end of 2017.That came after a more full-throated endorsement of the bloc issued by the country\u2019s main business lobby, the Confederation of British Industry.Speaking at the University of Oxford, Mr. Carney stressed that he was not giving an overall verdict on British membership, but on its implications for the bank.\u201cOver all, European Union membership has increased the openness of the U.K. economy, facilitating dynamism, but also creating some monetary and financial stability challenges for the Bank of England to manage,\u201d he said.\u201cThus far, we have been able to meet these challenges,\u201d he added.Mr. Carney also said that Britain\u2019s openness had made it vulnerable to shocks after the euro crisis and he argued that there should be \u201cclear principles to safeguard the interests of non-euro member states,\u201d including Britain, which kept the pound rather than adopting the European single currency.Aside from his status as a central bank governor, Mr. Carney, may prove to be influential player in the debate partly because, as a Canadian, he is a relative newcomer to Britain\u2019s agonized internal debate about its place in Europe.Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union often rely on the economic case for membership, and therefore hope that the voices of business and finance leaders could prove persuasive. On Wednesday, the Confederation of British Industry laid out its case for staying in a single market of 500 million people, and for being able to influence the bloc\u2019s rules and standards.\u201cAlternative arrangements to full membership either have serious downsides or are surrounded by huge uncertainty,\u201d Britain\u2019s main business group said.The industry group conceded that some of its members \u201crecognize that there are disadvantages to E.U. membership,\u201d and called for the regulatory burden on smaller businesses to be eased and for further measures to increase competitiveness in Europe.Still, it argued that membership in the bloc remained in the national interest. \u201cFor business, the benefits of full membership outweigh the disadvantages, but the European Union must work better,\u201d said the confederation\u2019s director general, John Cridland.Vote Leave, one of the groups campaigning for withdrawal from the union, rejected the business group\u2019s argument. \u201cThe fundamental logic of the single market is not supported by most U.K. businesses,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe want to end the supremacy of European Union law and regain the ability to make our own trade deals. There is only one way to choose our future, and that is to Vote Leave in the European Union referendum.\u201dBefore the referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron plans to renegotiate key aspects of British membership of the European Union, changes that \u2014 if achieved \u2014 he hopes to use to persuade Britons to stay in. Under pressure from several European allies, including France, Mr. Cameron has promised to give more information next month on the type of legislative and other concessions he wants.But on Tuesday, Britain\u2019s minister for Europe, David Lidington, suggested this would not amount to a detailed list.Mr. Lidington told reporters in London that his advice to Mr. Cameron was that the \u201clast thing\u201d he should do should be to publish \u201ca detailed negotiating position\u201d setting out \u201cred lines.\u201dThat, he added, was \u201cbecause a detailed negotiating position becomes seen either as an opening bid, from which you can of course be negotiated down, or it is seen by another group of people as an absolute minimum that you must get, and any retreat from that is a devastating reverse.\u201dProgress in these negotiations will determine the timing of the referendum, Mr. Lidington added.\u201cYou could be looking at next summer, you could be looking at next autumn, if we are still in European negotiations this time next year, then you\u2019re looking at 2017, sometime,\u201d Mr. Lidington said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking on the Superbugs", "Date": "2015-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Food for TomorrowAntibiotics are mixed with animals\u2019 feed or water to prevent illness and encourage growth in intensive, large-scale livestock operations where thousands of cows, pigs or chickens are housed in close quarters. In the United States, more than 70 percent of all antibiotics go to animals.That breeds resistant strains of bacteria that enter the food supply and the wider environment and can share their antibiotic-outwitting genes even with bugs that do not originate in animals, scientists say. While many nations have sought to rein in antibiotic overuse in humans, administration of the drugs to livestock is largely unregulated, and is increasing along with global demand for meat, eggs and dairy.Globally, livestock consumed 63,000 tons of antibiotics in 2010, and their use is expected to grow by two-thirds by 2030, said Dr. Juan Lubroth, chief of animal health at the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization.\u201cThis is the biggest single use of antibiotics and it\u2019s uncontrolled,\u201d said Ellen Silbergeld, a professor of environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cI was born at the dawn of the antibiotic era, and probably before I die the antibiotic era will be over.\u201dThe spread of multidrug-resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d would make now-minor infections life-threatening and drive death and disease to levels not seen since the 19th century, scientists say. \u201cIt would increase the rates of neonatal death among infants, it would make transplant and other kinds of surgery highly hazardous\u201d and push up rates of maternal death in childbirth, Ms. Silbergeld said.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the 1880s. This is not a clock we really want to wind backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re destroying most of our drugs.\u201dMr. Cameron warned last year that inaction could lead to \u201can almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine.\u201dSally Davies, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has called drug resistance a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d that ranks alongside terrorism and climate change as critical threats.Agriculture is driving about half of the resistance increase globally, and could be responsible for as much as 80 percent of the problem in the United States, where the large-scale, intensive approach to food production originated, said Jim O\u2019Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs and the chair of the British commission.Mr. O\u2019Neill said he hoped to see a United Nations agreement on tackling antibiotic resistance within a year, and has urged the Group of 20\u2019s 2016 host, China, to put the issue on the summit meeting\u2019s agenda.The farming and veterinary pharmaceutical industries say they use and make antibiotics responsibly, and that agriculture\u2019s role in creating resistance is exaggerated.Dr. Richard Carnevale, vice president for regulatory, scientific and international affairs at the Animal Health Institute, an association of animal drug companies, said antibiotic use in animals made only a small contribution to the wider resistance problem.\u201cIn the whole scheme of things, it\u2019s a relatively minor impact from what we can see, and I think that the situation gets a little blown out of proportion,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, agriculture gets lumped in and blamed with a lot of the problems in humans that really have nothing to do with animals.\u201dTrudy Wastweet, director of congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers and the food production companies they contract with use preventative antibiotics only for specific, discrete periods, for example on piglets whose immune systems are vulnerable when they are being weaned.\u201cThere\u2019s a frustration in agriculture that the use of these products is not understood,\u201d Ms. Wastweet said. \u201cJudicious use of those drugs on the farm, that is the norm, that is a standard of care our American livestock producers use.\u201dCritics say antibiotic use on United States farms is routine, leading to resistant strains of bacteria like E.coli and salmonella that taint meat and are released into air and water via the vast amounts of manure produced.Even more worrying, experts say, is the spread of intensive livestock production to developing countries, where huge farms are now common and the presence of counterfeit and poor-quality drugs create resistance even more quickly. Industrial-scale agriculture is likely to become even more widespread as poorer countries\u2019 economies grow and their expanding middle classes demand the meat, eggs and dairy products commonly consumed in the developed world.\u201cBacteria don\u2019t know any borders,\u201d said Ms. Silbergeld. \u201cAnd of course food doesn\u2019t know too many borders, either.\u201dChina, which produces half the world\u2019s pigs, has focused on reining in overuse of antibiotics in humans but has yet to confront animal use, Mr. O\u2019Neill said. Nor has India, a hotbed of antibiotic misuse and drug-resistant bugs, he said.Brazil, a major chicken exporter, is another big user, said Dr. Lubroth, of the Food and Agriculture Organization. He also pointed to Southeast Asia, where antibiotics are used in fish farming, risking the release of superbugs into lakes and rivers, as well as on the seafood the region exports.Europe has done the most to restrict antibiotics in agriculture, though its rules are a patchwork. Denmark, a big pork producer, outlaws antibiotic use on animals for all but disease treatment.Most contentious is the use of low levels of antibiotics in healthy animals to encourage them to grow faster.\u201cThey can fatten up the animals and get more from them at less cost,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAnd so until recently it\u2019s been a rough argument with consumers\u201d to restrict the drugs and risk raising food prices.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has asked veterinary pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily remove growth promotion from drug labels as an acceptable use for those antibiotics that are also important in human medicine. It also urged that the administration of such drugs be supervised by a veterinarian. Health experts have criticized those guidelines, part of a broader Obama administration strategy on drug resistance, as too lax. Last year, an F.D.A. report said agricultural use of medically important antibiotics had increased 16 percent from 2009 to 2012.Dr. Bernard Vallat, director general of the World Organization for Animal Health, an intergovernmental body, said half its 180 member nations deemed growth promotion an acceptable use, though he said the United States shift could prompt change.Dr. Vallat said veterinary oversight of antibiotics was key, calling, too, for better training of veterinarians in developing countries. Dr. Lubroth said improving hygiene would reduce the need for antibiotics, as could the development of new animal vaccines.It is not enough just to criticize developing countries without changing practices in the West too, he emphasized: \u201cWe can point fingers, but we should also hold up mirrors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everything he says sounds folksy and congenial. This is true even when he is berating Washington\u2019s political establishment, which he does often these days as the host of a morning show on Live 95.3, a talk-radio station in Florence, S.C.\u201cThere is a large part of me that wants to blow it up,\u201d he said on air recently. \u201cThat\u2019s the Donald Trump side. A large part of me says, \u2018Hey, man, we\u2019ve got a plutocracy that\u2019s bought and sold to special interests. It\u2019s crony capitalism.\u2019 And here comes this crazy fool that doesn\u2019t stand anywhere on any policy other than all over the place. But I believe he\u2019d blow up the building.\u201dBy \u201cthe building,\u201d Mr. Ard means the federal political system, broadly speaking. Though he joked that if Mr. Trump blew up the White House, he\u2019d construct a hotel on the premises and then crow about it: \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s one of the great addresses of all time, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and I\u2019ve got a property there.\u2019 \u201dMr. Ard\u2019s co-host, Dave Baker, chuckled. Then Mr. Ard turned more serious.\u201cWhat I struggle with is, how bad do I want to blow it up?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr am I willing to do more like a cruise ship and turn it a little bit at a time?\u201dAt the moment, Republican voters seem to favor the more eruptive option. That\u2019s one explanation for the popularity of Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, who are now collectively the choice of about 50 percent of registered Republican voters, according to a variety of national polls. The three candidates are free of the stigma of elective office. If Washington is the problem, goes the thinking, the solution is sure to come from somewhere else.Anti-establishment fervor has been a recurring theme in American politics for decades. Its catalysts seemed more obvious in the run-up to the two previous presidential elections, when the economy was entering the Great Recession in 2008, or coping with its aftermath in 2012. Economic despair is a potent political force. But we\u2019re now a few years into a recovery, the economy is expanding, albeit modestly, and the jobless rate has dropped to 5.1 percent from a peak of 10 percent in 2009. This makes the indignation of voters a little mystifying.Until you listen to indignant voters. Despite the still nascent recovery, a huge number of people in the middle and lower classes say their wages have not budged in years. For most Americans who are paid by the hour, wages have either fallen or remained flat for more than a decade, according to a report issued by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor think tank based in Washington. The institute called wage stagnation \u201cthe country\u2019s central economic challenge.\u201d\u201cIt tends to be assumed that if we have growth, people\u2019s hourly wages will improve,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, president of the institute. \u201cIn fact, that has not been the case since 2002, whether you have a college degree or not. And for the most part, this issue has not been confronted by economic policy makers.\u201dOn the Democratic side, there have been speeches by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has spoken about wage stagnation, largely in the context of wealth inequality. But the topic matters to Republicans, too. When asked in a poll to choose one issue that is paramount in deciding their vote, Republicans named the economy and jobs ahead of terrorism, immigration, health care and foreign policy.But Republican candidates have either ignored the issue or tiptoed around its edges, as Mr. Trump does when he talks about the offshoring of jobs to China and Mexico.It is an odd mismatch \u2014 flat wages seem to matter a lot to Republican voters, but Republican candidates are all but mum on the subject.Recently, I visited South Carolina, a reliably red state, to get a better sense of why \u201canti-politicians\u201d have experienced such a sustained surge in Republican polls. In a week of conversations, I heard much more than just venting about wages. There were lamentations that the United States is headed in the wrong direction, either because of failures by President Obama \u2014 good luck finding fans of his health care reform \u2014 or demographic changes that, in many voters\u2019 estimations, are changing the country too quickly. (Even people who said they had no problem with Mexican immigrants worried that the children of these immigrants would eventually tilt elections in favor of Democrats.) There was a lot of talk about dysfunction and stasis in Washington, as well as concerns about the national debt and annual deficits. Others fretted that the United States now plays a diminished role on the world stage.The mood was pretty glum, and this was before a deluge of rain shut down highways and flooded the state.Along with social and political grievances, the economy in general and flat wages in particular came up time and again. They are part of a large inventory of issues that may explain the appeal of outsider presidential candidates, if only because they earn political capital from anything that has people roiled, because they had no hand in policies that led to the roiling.\u201cI think all three are making a pitch, \u2018I\u2019m not what you\u2019re disgusted with,\u2019 \u201d said Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard University. \u201cIn the G.O.P. base, there is a strong sense that their own party hasn\u2019t done what they wanted them to.\u201dThe same day that Mr. Ard wondered whether to raze Washington or nudge it in a different direction, he had lunch with two friends at Red Bone Alley, a local restaurant. When the subject of wages came up, Mr. Ard started to reminisce in a way that I had heard more than a few times.\u201cI remember growing up, a man could work at DuPont, a big plant here in town,\u201d he said, \u201cand the wife would teach school, and before you knew it, they had a beach house. They\u2019d send a kid to University of South Carolina. They\u2019d send a kid to Clemson. They weren\u2019t up to their eyeballs in debt.\u201d\u201cAnd somewhere in the past 30 years, we\u2019ve lost that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming Republicans. I\u2019m not blaming Democrats. But if you\u2019re working at DuPont making 50 grand a year, if you\u2019re teaching, making 40 grand a year, you\u2019re doing all you can to keep your head above water.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump is talking to that family,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the family that says, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t know what else I can do. I can\u2019t get ahead.\u2019 I think that there is an undercurrent of anger that is far more severe than most politicians ever imagined it was. That\u2019s what Trump has tapped into.\u201dA few days after that lunch, Mr. Trump appeared in Columbia, the state capital. The event was billed as a town hall, with questions from voters presented by Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina. A near-capacity crowd filled the Koger Center for the Arts, an auditorium that seats about 2,200 people.On their way into the event, Ray and Melissa Lewie, a married couple, stopped and explained why they were attending.\u201cWe\u2019re here to hear what he has to say,\u201d said Mr. Lewie, a broad-shouldered man in his early 50s. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of politicians who just do what\u2019s in their best interest, to further their career.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not a professional politician,\u201d Ms. Lewie said.As for optimism about the economy, neither of them felt any.\u201cYou watch the news, and day in, day out, you hear people are getting jobs,\u201d Mr. Lewie said. \u201cI drive a truck for a living, and I drive all around the area, and I don\u2019t see it. The economy\u2019s growing? Not around here, it isn\u2019t.\u201dThe Lewies agreed to meet me for dinner a few days later with another couple, their longtime friends Carlos and Leah Veldhoven. Mr. Lewie\u2019s verdict on the Trump event? \u201cUnimpressed,\u201d he said, an opinion shared by his wife. Both found the hour so bereft of particulars that they could hardly take it seriously.For five years, Mr. Veldhoven and Mr. Lewie were long-haul trucking partners. \u201cWe were driving as a team,\u201d said Mr. Veldhoven, at the restaurant Bonefish Grill. \u201cEight hours on, eight hours off. We could make it from L.A. to New York City in a day and a half, two days.\u201dMr. Veldhoven eventually quit that job to join a car dealership, where he is now manager of the used-car department. Mr. Lewie became a solo driver of an 18-wheeler, a job that has given him a front-seat view of global economic forces at work. For years, one of his regular assignments was hauling disassembled textile mills to container ports in Charleston, where they were floated to Mexico.\u201cBefore the equipment was taken apart,\u201d Mr. Lewie said, \u201cthe companies would bring people up from Mexico up to South Carolina to learn the jobs. Everyone knew they were being replaced, but they needed the paycheck, and they\u2019d teach the Mexicans until the place closed down.\u201dToday, Mr. Lewie hauls steel construction rods, about 47,000 pounds of them a day. He is an independent contractor who owns his own truck and gets assignments from a company that keeps 23 percent of the revenue generated by each haul. He gets paid by the mile \u2014 $1.67 \u2014 no matter how many hours he\u2019s on the road.He can burn through up to 600 gallons of fuel a week, a hefty part of his overhead. Fuel prices have come down, which is great news, but maintenance on his truck cost him $26,000 in 2014, and despite low inflation, the price of a new tire has doubled, to $400, in recent years. When we met, he\u2019d earned $1,560 the previous week, before taxes.This is a good living, but when all the numbers are tallied, Mr. Lewie says he is pocketing the same annual income that he did right before the recession. None of this makes him the least bit interested in Bernie Sanders, the candidate who, at least on paper, seems to speak most directly about what ails Mr. Lewie. There\u2019s no way he would vote for someone who calls himself a socialist, Mr. Lewie said. Nor did Mr. Sanders\u2019s policies appeal to him, not even raising the minimum wage. Mr. Lewie\u2019s hauls come from large corporations, and he worries about their financial health more than any frontline employee\u2019s.\u201cFor me to prosper, the economy has to prosper,\u201d Mr. Lewie said, \u201cand it\u2019s the rich people that produce jobs.\u201dWhen asked to assign blame for stagnating wages, he and his wife pointed to the federal government. Regulations and high taxes, he said, not lower wages abroad, led those textile mill companies to move to Mexico.\u201cI was at a mill where the E.P.A. did a walk-around and found oil on the ground and fined the company tens of thousands of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to Mexico, they don\u2019t have that.\u201d Then again, he acknowledged that he didn\u2019t know what Mexican textile workers were paid, making it hard to pinpoint what role wages played in decisions to relocate.The Lewies and Veldhovens share a visceral dislike for President Obama, and much of their animosity for Washington seems entwined with their ill feelings about the president. The state of the nation, in their eyes, was at an all-time low.\u201cI think we\u2019re at the bottom,\u201d Ms. Lewie said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything. Taxes, the economy, the government.\u201d\u201cOur money is being wasted, wasted, wasted,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re paying more and more, and our debts are going up and up, and we need to stop the debt. We have to find someone that\u2019s going to actually take control and say, \u2018Stop spending.\u2019 \u201dHer husband said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it could get any worse.\u201d\u201cThe government is taking 39 percent now,\u201d said Mr. Lewie, a little morosely, referring to the top income tax bracket. Not for the first time during the meal, he worried that high taxes would discourage the wealthy from producing jobs. \u201cIf they want 45 percent, they\u2019ll take that and spend more. If they want 60 percent, they\u2019ll take that and spend more. How much is enough?\u201dThe Lewies haven\u2019t settled on a candidate. But they know that their choice would probably be someone who had never worked in Washington.There are political scientists who believe that neither the economy nor paychecks actually motivate voter behavior. They say cultural and social issues, like race relations, immigration and same-sex marriage, are the principal drivers of political choices.\u201cIt\u2019s this sense, said Christopher S. Parker, of the University of Washington, \u201cthat the country is not what it used to be.\u201dIn South Carolina, it is certainly true that holding a dim view of the federal government is something of a tradition. In the span of five days, three different people remarked that South Carolina fired the first shots in the Civil War. Pollsters say that any optimism about the economy here is regarded as the work of state politicians who have succeeded despite the Democrat in the White House.\u201cWhen you hear any confidence among Republicans,\u201d said Scott Huffmon, a professor at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., \u201cnone of it is attributed to the Obama administration. It\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Thank God we have a wall of conservative protection to keep Obama from pushing through.\u2019 \u201dFlorence County, which has a population of about 140,000, has lured some large companies, including Otis Elevator, QVC and General Electric, through aggressive economic outreach and statewide laws that strongly discourage unionization. And some of the county\u2019s 19th-century buildings are being renovated, including a 50,000-square-foot project that includes condos, a restaurant and a rooftop bar.The counties that surround Florence, however, are ailing. The unemployment rate in nearby Marion County, for instance, is about 9.5 percent. And in addition to those seeking jobs, there are the so-called discouraged workers who have stopped looking. Nationwide, there are about seven million or eight million discouraged workers, said Timothy Kane, an economist at the conservative think tank the Hoover Institution.\u201cIf supply of labor is ample,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is no wage pressure. It\u2019s not a coldhearted attitude to say that employees will be paid what they\u2019re worth to a firm.\u201dThat ethos explains the mind-set about wages at McCall Farms, a fruit and vegetable canning company in Effingham, about 10 miles from Florence. The company operates a one-million-square-foot factory, selling 60 items \u2014 sweet potatoes, string beans, peaches, apple sauce, and so on \u2014 to supermarket chains.\u201cWe\u2019ve invested heavily in our plant,\u201d he said. Specifically, McCall has been upgrading the machines that put lids on cans, and McCall now cans 600 products a minute, double the rate of a few years ago.McCall has also been buying up less nimble rivals \u2014 in effect, acquiring their product lines and customers. Interest rates have remained low, a boon to a business that needs to borrow money to invest in equipment. Volume and productivity are up. That means more revenue and profits.On the labor side, the picture is different. The company\u2019s payroll has doubled, to 1,000 employees, in recent years, about 80 percent of whom are hourly earners, Mr. Swink said. They average about $12.50 an hour.\u201cThey\u2019ve been given a cost-of-living increase,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut that\u2019s about it.\u201dMcCall has kept wages steady for hourly employees because there has been little competition for their jobs, and thus no upward pressure on their wages.Their jobs tend to be low skilled \u2014 spotting defective vegetables and removing them from production lines, for instance \u2014 and McCall would have little problem replacing anyone who wanted to leave.\u201cWe do feel some competition for employees,\u201d Mr. Swink said. \u201cHonda has opened a plant here. Roche, the pharmaceutical company, is here. But we are able to get the caliber of employees that we need without an issue.\u201dThe 20 percent of salaried employees at McCall have fared better. They tend to be in higher-skilled positions in the maintenance or electrical departments, or working with computers. They could easily jump to a different company. In the last eight years or so, those employees have been given raises of about 15 percent.\u201cI had not thought about it until we discussed it,\u201d Mr. Swink said on the phone, in a follow-up conversation. \u201cThe average hourly wage earner here, their lifestyle isn\u2019t getting better. It\u2019s staying the same.\u201dEconomists differ about what exactly would help raise wages for hourly workers. Progressive economists urge more government intervention; right-leaning economists urge less. The former say that raising the minimum wage would have ripple effects on the paychecks of employees higher on the pay scale. The latter, such as Edward P. Lazear of the Hoover Institution, argue that increased regulations and capital gains taxes are to blame for stagnant wages and suppressed job creation.The phrase \u201cno silver bullet\u201d came up a lot in discussions on the topic. And the elusiveness of solutions to the wage issue, perhaps, also leads voters to candidates with no Washington experience. In the absence of action and answers, a deep exasperation with the status quo sets in.The day of that meal at the Bonefish Grill, John Boehner, the House speaker, announced that he would resign from Congress, citing a faction within his party that stood against deal-making of any kind with Democrats. It was a reminder that an insurrectionist, \u201cthrow the bums out\u201d movement had, in 2010, put a few dozen Republican lawmakers with Tea Party leanings into office. Some were first-time office seekers; all of them had campaigned against Washington.Which makes some wonder: Why would yet another populist wave cure what ails the economy? And why isn\u2019t anger, like that expressed by the Lewies and the Veldhovens, directed at the Republicans?\u201cWe want them out,\u201d his wife said. \u201cWe want people.\u201dBut isn\u2019t everyone a person until elected, at which point they become a politician?You can never tell what someone will become after they get into office, Mr. Lewie said. \u201cThe ones that are entrenched,\u201d he explained, \u201cneed to go.\u201dAn earlier version of this article reversed the captions for pictures of Ken Ard and Henry Swink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exxon\u2019s Climate Concealment", "Date": "2015-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, MASS. \u2014 MILLIONS of Americans once wanted to smoke. Then they came to understand how deadly tobacco products were. Tragically, that understanding was long delayed because the tobacco industry worked for decades to hide the truth, promoting a message of scientific uncertainty instead.Had Exxon been upfront at the time about the dangers of the greenhouse gases we were spewing into the atmosphere, we might have begun decades ago to develop a less carbon-intensive energy path to avert the worst impacts of a changing climate. Amazingly, politicians are still debating the reality of this threat, thanks in no small part to industry disinformation.Government and academic scientists alerted policy makers to the potential threat of human-driven climate change in the 1960s and \u201970s, but at that time climate change was still a prediction. By the late 1980s it had become an observed fact.But Exxon was sending a different message, even though its own evidence contradicted its public claim that the science was highly uncertain and no one really knew whether the climate was changing or, if it was changing, what was causing it.These efforts turned the problem from a matter of fact into a matter of opinion. When the Exxon chief executive, Lee Raymond, insisted in the late 1990s that the science was still uncertain, the media covered it, business leaders accepted it and the American people were confused.For people close to the issue, it was never credible that Exxon \u2014 a company that employs thousands of scientists and engineers and whose core business depends on their expertise \u2014 could be that confused about the science. We now know that they not only understood the science, but contributed to it.As early as 1977, one of Exxon\u2019s senior scientists warned a gathering of oilmen of a \u201cgeneral scientific agreement\u201d that the burning of fossil fuels was influencing the climate. A year later, he had updated his assessment, warning that \u201cpresent thinking holds that man has a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.\u201dIn the 1980s, Exxon scientists collaborated with academic and government researchers to build climate models and understand their implications. When one researcher expressed the opinion that the impacts would be \u201cwell short of catastrophic,\u201d the director of the Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences Laboratory at Exxon Research responded in a memo, \u201cI think that this statement may be too reassuring.\u201d He said it was \u201cdistinctly possible\u201d that the projected warming trend after 2030 \u201cwill indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the earth\u2019s population),\u201d a conclusion that most climate scientists now hold, assuming we continue business as usual.What did Exxon executives do with this information? Until 1989, they circulated reports summarizing it inside the company. They allowed their scientists to attend academic meetings, to participate in panels, and to publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals \u2014 in short, to behave as scientists. And they did acknowledge the \u201cpotentially catastrophic events that must be considered.\u201dInstead \u2014 like the tobacco industry \u2014 Exxon chose the path of disinformation, denial and delay. More damagingly, the company set a model for the rest of the industry. More than 30 years ago, Exxon scientists acknowledged in internal company memos that climate change could be catastrophic. Today, scientists who say the exact same thing are ridiculed in the business community and on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.We have lost precious time as a result: decades during which we could have built a smart electricity grid, fostered efficiency and renewables and generated thousands of jobs in a cleaner, greener economy. There is still time to prevent the worst disruptions of human-driven climate change, but the challenge is now much greater than it needed to be, in no small part because of the choices that Exxon Mobil made.Naomi Oreskes is a professor of the history of science at Harvard and the author, with Erik M.

{"Headline": "Pacific Trade Deal Jolts Canadian Campaign ", "Date": "2015-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 While the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact may well be the subject of future political battles in the United States and elsewhere, its arrival amid an election campaign in Canada ignited debate here instantly.The announcement of the deal came exactly two weeks before Canadians vote in a national election that has shifted among several issues, including expense account fiddling by Conservative senators and the wearing of face coverings by some Muslim women at citizenship ceremonies. With Canada\u2019s economy dragged down by the collapse of oil prices, the trade pact was simultaneously portrayed as a potent force for economic revival by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative, and a job destroyer by Tom Mulcair, the leader of the New Democratic Party.While the agreement was unlikely to completely dominate the campaign as debate over free trade with the United States did in 1988, its political effect could be enough to tip the balance in a contest where the Conservatives, New Democrats and Liberals, under Justin Trudeau, have been locked in a near three-way tie in polling since the campaign began in August.Yet as in 1988, both opponents and proponents pledged to add their voices to the debate.\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s going to be an issue in the election,\u201d said Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, a union that counts 41,000 autoworkers among its 310,000 members. \u201cThis should destroy the Conservatives in manufacturing Ontario.\u201dMr. Dias\u2019s prediction may largely reflect organized labor\u2019s general antipathy toward Mr. Harper\u2019s government. Yet most analysts agree that Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, is likely to be decisive in determining who forms the next government. And while the Trans-Pacific deal creates opportunities for many Canadian industries, including forestry and fisheries, there are many who predict that may accelerate the gradual decline of Canada\u2019s auto and auto-parts industry, which is almost entirely based in Ontario and accounts for about 20 percent of the province\u2019s industrial activity.Several polls have suggested that the Conservatives could lose their current hold on several constituencies surrounding Toronto. Many of those places have auto assembly or parts plants.While campaigning on Tuesday in Whitby, an Ontario city adjacent to the General Motors of Canada headquarters in Oshawa, Mr. Harper offered the auto industry a billion Canadian dollars spread over 10 years to encourage construction of auto assembly plants. As autoworkers held a protest against the agreement outside the factory hosting his campaign stop, Mr. Harper insisted the pact would expand the industry. \u201cWe believe that this deal offers enormous benefits for the automobile sector,\u201d he said. Compared with Nafta, the Trans-Pacific agreement would allow duty-free entry for automobiles with a lower percentage of parts that manufacturers must obtain from within the free trade area. That, some experts say, could leave Canadian parts makers, which employ 81,000 people, vulnerable to backdoor competition from, among others, China, which was not part of the pact.\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated picture,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an election issue where people feel automotive jobs are threatened.\u201dMr. Mulcair has repeatedly pledged not to be bound by the agreement if his party forms the next government largely because of what he believes will be its effect on automotive employment.\u201cIf elected, Canada will not be part of an agreement that loses 20,000 jobs,\u201d he declared at a campaign rally in Toronto.While the Liberal Party led the unsuccessful fight against free trade with the United States in 1988, Mr. Trudeau now describes his party as a champion of trade pacts. Yet he has said that he cannot endorse the Trans-Pacific deal until its full text is available.Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, said that he welcomed the attention to his generally overlooked industry. But, he added diplomatically, it may be that neither Mr. Harper nor Mr. Mulcair is correct. Ten large parts makers that employ half of the industry\u2019s workers, he said, might benefit from the deal. But, he added, many of the other 300 small operators \u201care really going to be under pressure.\u201dHe predicted that it would take at least five years to see if the gains by the big companies, like Magna International, offset the small players\u2019 losses. \u201cAnybody who is championing gains or who is forecasting losses is way ahead of themselves,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Budget Deal Promising Peace Is Rooted in Modest Goals", "Date": "2015-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress and the White House spent September bracing for a disruptive government shutdown, and most of October fretting over a possible default on the federal debt.Then, suddenly \u2014 almost implausibly \u2014 a budget deal was delivered just before midnight on Monday, one that promises relative tranquillity if not a full-on d\u00e9tente. The rancor that had defined Congress gave way to a complex 144-page bill. Its passage on Wednesday was virtually guaranteed before many lawmakers had a chance to read the table of contents.Even when the House was in disarray, with Mr. Boehner\u2019s long career being brought low by the far-right Freedom Caucus, congressional leadership aides were negotiating with White House officials on the spending plan. But Mr. Boehner\u2019s resignation freed him to work with his longtime counterpart, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, to clinch a deal and secure the needed votes.The outcome was in some ways so unlikely that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, expressed concern that Americans might conclude something was amiss. \u201cWhat has happened is nothing that should be alarming; it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cBut it should be of interest to the American people: We did what we should be doing, sitting down and talking through our differences.\u201dAs a result of the accord, officials said, congressional Republicans and the White House can return to the more conventional policy battles with stakes decidedly lower than a default or shutdown that could upend the global economy.Under the proposed deal, short-term expenditures, notably on military programs, would rise and long-term budget caps would remain in place. Meanwhile, spending priorities would be set the old-fashioned way, by seasoned lawmakers on Appropriations subcommittees.These and other consequences of their late-night landmark deal began coming into focus on Tuesday.The deal, which would increase spending by $80 billion over two years, is almost underwhelming in its modest size and scope. But after five years of all-out brawling, legislative gridlock and general dysfunction, that may be the inherent genius of it.By combining the relatively small spending increases, which temporarily break through the budget limitations loathed by Democrats, with small cuts to social programs loathed by Republicans, the accord reached Monday night seems to provide a compromise that will attract a solid majority of lawmakers in the House and Senate.\u201cYou\u2019re going to see bricks flying from those that don\u2019t like the fact that there\u2019s a bipartisan agreement,\u201d said Mr. Boehner, who perhaps had more reason than anyone to celebrate a final achievement before leaving Congress at the end of the week. \u201cBut there it is. It\u2019s a solid agreement. And I told my colleagues there isn\u2019t any reason why any member should vote against this.\u201dConservative Republicans in the House, however, said they hated the deal and how it had been pulled together, in negotiations behind closed doors.Even as Mr. Ryan, who is expected to be elected the next speaker on Thursday, railed against the measure on television \u2014 telling CNN that \u201cthe process stinks\u201d \u2014 he will start his job with a far less perilous agenda.But for the most part, Democrats and Republicans began lining up in support of the agreement.\u201cMost importantly, we have affirmed that the full faith and credit of the United States is nonnegotiable and inviolable,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.With most of the 188 Democrats in the House expected to back the deal, it seemed that fewer than 50 of the chamber\u2019s 247 Republicans would be needed to ensure its passage, which is expected in a floor vote on Wednesday.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said he would quickly take up the bill, and other Republicans predicted it would win swift approval.\u201cI think there will be bipartisan support,\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican, said on Tuesday.The White House, more relieved than rejoicing, also voiced support.\u201cIt\u2019s an actual bipartisan compromise, which hasn\u2019t been happening a lot in Washington recently,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a speech to law enforcement officials in Chicago. \u201cIt allows us to plan for the future.\u201dOver 144 pages, the new budget deal was reached as Speaker John A. Boehner prepares to leave office.White House officials regarded the deal as a better one than they had dared to imagine even a few months ago, when the budget impasse with Republicans appeared to be careering toward another crisis.Mr. Boehner\u2019s retirement announcement, on Sept. 25, changed all that, and he seemed emboldened by the prospect that he could \u201cclean out the barn\u201d for his successor.White House aides quickly conveyed that they would be happy to take up their mops and brooms.In the weeks since, Mr. Obama quietly dispatched Katie Beirne Fallon, his legislative affairs chief, and Brian Deese, his senior adviser and a longtime economic aide, to work out the details with aides to House and Senate leaders from both parties. Mr. Obama refrained from intervening personally except for the occasional phone call.While passage of the new budget deal seemingly assured, there were also some wrinkles on Tuesday. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office showed the bill coming up short of the savings needed to fully offset new spending. House leaders fixed that problem late Tuesday, and the Rules Committee moved the bill forward for action on the floor on Wednesday.There is also a $32 billion increase for emergency overseas operations by the Pentagon and the State Department, bringing the total increase to $112 billion \u2014 a number that Democrats said exceeded their goals.As has been the case virtually from the moment he became speaker, Mr. Boehner was hammered on Tuesday by Republicans on his right flank.Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and a founder of the Freedom Caucus, said: \u201cWe sort of knew John was selling us down the river on the debt ceiling. I don\u2019t think we realized he would actually sink the ship by adding on all of these additional spending measures and all of these other extraneous matters.\u201dRohit Kumar, a former adviser to Mr. McConnell who participated in past budget negotiations, said the deal offered a chance to return to more routine, if still adversarial debate, in Congress.\u201cVery rarely will you have somebody doing cartwheels through the chamber when you have got a compromise measure,\u201d Mr. Kumar. \u201cThis is the difference between campaigning and governing. In campaigns, you can promise people the stars; when you govern, you have to make tough choices.\u201dAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly the name of the committee that is chaired by Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas. It is the House Financial Services Committee, not the Banking Committee.Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Michael D. Shear and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Ambitious Rail Projects Crash Into Harsh Realities in Latin America", "Date": "2015-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut across the region, one large Chinese rail venture after another has come crashing against the hard realities of Latin American politics, resistance from environmental groups, and a growing wariness toward China. While China boasts of its rail initiatives around the world, it has often been stymied here in Latin America, reflecting how even China\u2019s formidable ambitions have limits.Now, new worries over China\u2019s economic growth are raising more doubts about the blitz of what China calls its \u201crailroad diplomacy,\u201d as parts of Latin America reel from their dependence on China.The enormous twin-ocean railroad across Brazil and Peru, in particular, \u201cwill be a crucial test of China\u2019s mettle as a global power and the potential for greater acquiescence in South America to the designs that China has on our resources,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Eust\u00e1quio Diniz Alves, a Brazilian scholar.\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the downside of our overreliance on China now that the opaque Chinese economy is in flux,\u201d he added. \u201cImagine what will happen if this railway somehow advances, bringing with it environmental devastation and even more leverage for China in our affairs.\u201dMore than 100 years ago, Americans were among the foreigners who rolled into the heart of South America with ambitious plans to build railways. The ruins of their grand designs for the Brazilian Amazon, called the Devil\u2019s Railway because of the thousands of workers who died building it, are a testament to the dangers of relying too heavily on commodity exports.Officials slowly abandoned the railroad, parts of which are now swallowed by jungle, after rubber prices collapsed generations ago. These days, China is the one suffering an array of setbacks in railroad projects across the region, at a time when the demand for Latin America\u2019s commodities \u2014 like soybeans, iron ore, copper and oil \u2014 has slowed.In Honduras, two years have passed since Chinese investors announced the railway linking the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific. Yet Miguel Servell\u00f3n, an official with the state agency promoting the project, said it was \u201cstill a long way from happening,\u201d listing obstacles like a complex environmental approval process.In another project aimed at finding an alternative to the Panama Canal, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said four years ago that Colombia and China had a plan that was \u201cquite advanced\u201d to build a railway linking the Pacific to the Caribbean. But the mood has changed considerably since then.\u201cIt\u2019s a subject that was mentioned in 2011 and subsequently had minimal relevance,\u201d said Daniela S\u00e1nchez, the director of the Colombia-China Chamber of Commerce.But while Venezuela\u2019s government boasted that passenger service would start in 2012, the project has been fraught for years with work stoppages and money shortfalls on the Venezuelan side. The Chinese authorities say that more than half of the railway has been built, though Venezuelan news media reported in June that work camps on the route had been abandoned.An even bigger project floated by a Chinese telecommunications tycoon, a 172-mile canal across Nicaragua, intended as a rival to the Panama Canal, has been met with broad skepticism about its feasibility as well as protests by farmers living along the proposed route.Despite the obstacles, China has pressed ahead with the twin-ocean railway across Brazil and Peru, building on trade between China and Latin America that surged to $285 billion in 2014, from $12 billion in 2000, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund.Lucas do Rio Verde, a farming outpost of 70,000 people, could find itself almost in the middle of the proposed 3,300-mile route, raising hopes that it could be transformed into a major agricultural shipping hub.But in the shadows of the grain silos towering over soybean fields and the meat-processing plant here, the responses have often involved more shrugging than jumping for joy.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that China has the money and know-how to make this happen,\u201d said Ricardo Tomczyk, the president of an industry group representing soybean farmers. But \u201cwe know that Brazil\u2019s bureaucracy is more formidable than building a railway across the peaks of the Andes.\u201dMore enthusiastic supporters of the venture argue that the recent flux in the Chinese economy is merely a blip in China\u2019s rise in Latin America. Though some economists have noted the steady decline in China\u2019s foreign currency reserves, Chinese banks and engineering companies are still expected to have ample funds for the $10 billion project, they say, despite the recent drop in China\u2019s currency, the renminbi.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.In fact, some political analysts say that the decline in commodity prices and Brazil\u2019s stumbling economy could actually enhance China\u2019s bargaining power, helping it to persuade the local authorities to accept Chinese terms for the railway.\u201cBarring a more intense crisis in China, Chinese investors still wield enormous financial clout, far more than the strained players in the Brazilian market,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Nassif, an economist at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, an elite university in Rio de Janeiro.Still, political leaders, farmers and environmental activists are eyeing China\u2019s difficulties in completing railroads elsewhere in Latin America. They point out Brazil\u2019s particularly nettlesome bureaucracy, its laws prohibiting China from hiring its own laborers, a web of auditing courts, and the capacity of dozens of different prosecutors to cripple megaprojects with lawsuits.\u201cOn top of all that, we have a very fragile government,\u201d said Otaviano Pivetta, the mayor of Lucas do Rio Verde, noting the push to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, who supports the Chinese railway project. \u201cSure, I\u2019d like this to happen, but we cannot ignore the obstacles.\u201dChina already outranks the United States as Brazil\u2019s largest trading partner. But while Chinese demand for commodities fueled the growth of farming cities like Lucas do Rio Verde, exports of soybeans and corn are still largely taken to ports on deplorable public roads like BR-163, a 1,097-mile route cutting across the Amazon.Stretches of the road remain unpaved, raising freight costs. When it rains, some truckers along muddy stretches simply find themselves stuck for days.\u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t fully trust that the U.S. won\u2019t try to restrict them at certain strategic choke points,\u201d said R. Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American studies at the United States Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, pointing to China\u2019s reliance on shipping lanes like the Panama Canal.Some political leaders in both Brazil and Peru have welcomed the Chinese proposal, gauging its seriousness by the fact that Li Keqiang, the Chinese prime minister, personally promoted the project while visiting both countries in May. Chinese officials agreed to deliver a feasibility report in about a year.The governors of three states in the Brazilian Amazon that the railroad would traverse are voicing support for the railway. But even some who stand to benefit from it acknowledge the vexing array of challenges.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pessimistic about their railroad, but it will be very hard,\u201d said Marino Franz, a former mayor of Lucas do Rio Verde.Powerful political and business figures, whose river ports and soybean processing centers could be threatened by the railway, are already blasting the Chinese venture.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Senator Blairo Maggi, a soybean farmer and former governor of Mato Grosso State told his counterparts in the Senate.Beyond the opposition among powerful Brazilian agribusiness interests, environmental groups are also marshaling resistance to the railway, claiming that it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon River basin.Brazil\u2019s labor laws, which make it considerably difficult for companies to hire foreign workers, are another potential obstacle, in contrast to railroads in African countries that the Chinese have built with their own laborers.\u201cWith all due respect, the African countries are a little bit more desperate,\u201d said Kevin Gallagher, a scholar at Boston University who studies China\u2019s forays into Latin America. \u201cIn Latin America, there\u2019s more red tape, some of it good, some of it bad.\u201dWith Brazil\u2019s economy ailing, some powerful officials are signaling that they may be willing to accept China\u2019s proposal, while also suggesting that the railway could be pursued with a less ambitious, piecemeal approach.Mr. Gallagher said the railway ranks among the largest infrastructure projects in Latin America in the last century.\u201cChina will have to race up the learning curve for this to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Chinese can\u2019t make this happen, then no one can.\u201dReporting was contributed by Frances Robles from Managua, Nicaragua; Paulina Villegas from Mexico City; Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires; Andrea Zarate from Lima, Peru; Susan Abad from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Opaque Investments in Delivery Ventures", "Date": "2015-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAlibaba\u2019s expanding delivery arm is a financial blind spot. The Chinese e-commerce group owns just under half of the company that manages billions of its packages each year. Yet Alibaba has spent over $6.3 billion on logistics-related deals in three years. When it comes to working out whether these investments make strategic sense, shareholders are in the dark.The $148 billion e-commerce giant matches buyers with sellers on its online platforms, but doesn\u2019t control shipping or delivery. Instead, merchants choose from a huge and fragmented list of companies across China to warehouse, transport and drop off their products. Three years ago Alibaba joined forces with a handful of partners to set up Cainiao Logistics, a 5 billion renminbi ($787 million) venture which it describes as an information-sharing platform that links delivery companies.Cainiao has a partnership network of 15 companies with over 1.5 million delivery employees across the country. In the 12 months to March, this network claims to have delivered 8.6 billion packages from Alibaba\u2019s shopping platforms. To compare, the American parcel giant UPS delivered under half of that number globally in 2014.Alibaba\u2019s 48 percent stake means it does not formally control Cainao. However, the venture\u2019s president, Judy Tong, is a member of the powerful partnership committee which nominates the majority of the e-commerce group\u2019s board.Moreover, Alibaba has also been pouring cash into other logistics ventures. Earlier this year it pumped $4.6 billion into Suning, an electronics retailer that owns 65 national and regional distribution centers. It has invested in Singapore Post and YTO Express, a delivery company that is part of Cainiao\u2019s network. And last year it bought stakes in Chinese electronics group Haier and its logistics subsidiary, as well as in a department store operator whose parent is Cainiao\u2019s second-largest shareholder. In total Alibaba has spent at least $6.3 billion, according to Breakingviews calculations.This matters, because the company founded by Jack Ma has made a virtue of its asset-light business model. Not holding inventory and outsourcing delivery to other providers has proved lucrative. Alibaba\u2019s adjusted net profit margin in the quarter ending June was 47 percent. Contrast that with its Chinese rival JD.com, which has adopted an Amazon-like model that requires it to maintain a large inventory and build up its own delivery network. The $36 billion group has yet to turn a profit.Yet there are signs that getting packages to consumers quickly and reliably is an increasingly important battleground. JD.com offers same-day and next-day services for over 80 percent of orders it delivers while Alibaba aims to have next-day delivery available in 50 cities by the end of the year. Cainiao has said it plans to spend 100 billion renminbi over the next few years and wants to quintuple its warehouse space to five million square meters next year.Meanwhile, Alibaba and JD.com are battling it out in time-sensitive products like fresh groceries: Earlier this year, Cainiao started offering same-day food delivery in Beijing and Shanghai for Alibaba\u2019s online supermarket. JD.com announced a $700 million investment in a supermarket operator in August. The latest e-commerce buzzword \u2013 \u201conline to offline\u201d \u2013 also hinges on speedy and reliable deliveries.Because it is a minority investor, Alibaba doesn\u2019t have to break out financial results for its logistics ventures. It is not clear from the company\u2019s financial statements whether Cainiao is generating any significant revenue or making a profit.With net cash of over $16 billion, Alibaba can afford to make bold bets in logistics and other areas. Its executive vice chairman, Joe Tsai, has likened the group\u2019s shopping spree to a coordinated chess game. Even so, these ventures are a financial drain: If Alibaba were to finance Cainiao\u2019s planned 100 billion renminbi expansion in proportion with its current shareholding, the investment would be equivalent to the group\u2019s operating net cash for the year to last March.In such a capital-intensive business, sharing the burden with other investors may make financial sense. Cainiao\u2019s partnerships mean Alibaba can partly offload the risk of owning warehouses and delivery stations, or employing over a million couriers. But the company\u2019s shareholders can only guess at the true costs, or what kind of returns the investments might generate.Worries of a slowing Chinese economy have wiped out half of Alibaba\u2019s market value since last November. Any suggestion that the company\u2019s margins are less healthy than they look would offer a renewed challenge to investors\u2019 faith. But even as delivery becomes increasingly important, Alibaba shareholders can only guess at how much it costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Forest Fires Take Toll on Wildlife, Big and Small", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 A disoriented, pregnant orangutan, her treetop home in Indonesian Borneo reduced to charred wood, is rushed to a rehabilitation center by conservationists, who dodged walls of fire and toxic smoke.Veterinarians care for 16 abandoned baby orangutans already living at the center. The babies had developed respiratory infections because of haze from the fire, delaying the conservationists\u2019 continuing attempts to teach them how to live on their own in the wild.While plenty has been written about the economic costs of the fires and the human suffering they have caused \u2014 hundreds of thousands of people sickened by the haze in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and a regional price tag that one expert estimated at more than $14 billion \u2014 so far, scientists and environmentalists can only speculate about the extent of the damage to wildlife, including endangered species like the orangutan.But the early signs are not good.\u201cWe\u2019re still not sure how many might have gotten sick or died,\u201d said Paulina Ela, a spokeswoman for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, which runs two rescue and rehabilitation centers in the region.\u201cThe impact is not really visible now, but maybe in the next two or three months,\u201d she said.In the Indonesian province of Central Kalimantan, which lies on Borneo, the organization has rescued nine endangered orangutans whose habitats were destroyed by fires, Ms. Ela said. One was relocated to a safer area, and eight others, including three babies, the pregnant female and a male whose eyes were damaged by burning debris, were taken to the rehabilitation center for treatment, she said.The province includes Sebangau National Park, which is home to the world\u2019s largest population of wild orangutans, estimated at around 7,000.But orangutans are far from the only species suffering. Indonesia\u2019s fauna is among the world\u2019s most diverse, and a broad spectrum of wildlife \u2014 including elephants, birds, snakes and even insects \u2014 has been severely affected by the fires and choking haze, scientists say.This month, Indonesia\u2019s Forestry Ministry announced that more than 4.2 million acres of forest and open land had been destroyed by the fires. Each year, fires are intentionally set to clear land cheaply \u2014 for palm oil plantations, for pulp and paper mill operations, and for other agricultural uses \u2014 but they grew out of control this year because of prolonged drought and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, scientists say.This week, scientific and conservation organizations reported that endangered species like orangutans, Sumatran tigers and Sumatran elephants, among other wildlife, had fled burning rain forests and moved toward areas settled by humans.\u201cThere will be a huge impact on endangered species because they need a big habitat,\u201d said Yuyun Indradi, a campaign team leader for Greenpeace Indonesia.\u201cAnd with this gone, there will be more human-animal conflicts\u201d over land, he said. \u201cElephants and tigers especially.\u201dThat would worsen a longstanding problem in Indonesia. The western island of Sumatra has had many cases of rural farmers shooting wild elephant herds that moved onto plantations in search of food, or rampaged through farmlands and villages in what had once been their habitat.Sumatran tigers have been trapped and killed after killing farmers and villagers while hunting at night. Orangutans have also been shot dead in their dwindling habitats in Sumatra and Kalimantan, or captured and sold as pets.Even the tiniest creatures are being affected by the fires, and that could also have repercussions for people. During Indonesia\u2019s last severe forest fire crisis, in 1997, the haze significantly reduced bee populations, which took three years to recover, said Erik Meijaard, coordinator of Borneo Futures, a conservation project.That is likely to hurt agricultural production in Indonesia, he said, since bees are crucial to the pollination of apples, melons, onions, potatoes, tomatoes and other crops. \u201cYour common fruits and vegetables are bee-pollinated, so without them they won\u2019t grow,\u201d Mr. Meijaard said.Scientists and government officials are also waiting anxiously to see the fallout of the crisis on Indonesia\u2019s plant life, including its shrinking rain forests.Douglas Sheil, a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, said that large forest fires in Indonesia were typically preceded by periods of intense drought that left both flora and fauna vulnerable. While drought can have a bigger impact on primary forests, he said, the fires that follow destroy seedlings.\u201cThis \u2018double punch\u2019 or \u2018triple punch\u2019 of drought, fire and smoke is likely to be much more damaging to the biome than any one of these elements alone, for trees, bees and everything else,\u201d Mr. Sheil said.Estimates of how much the crisis will hurt Indonesia\u2019s economy, as well as those of its affected neighbors, differ, but some say the regional damage could be in the tens of billions of dollars.Last month, Herry Purnomo, a scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research, a global scientific organization based in Bogor, Indonesia, estimated that the economic cost for Southeast Asia would be $14 billion. That included factors like lost agricultural production and health costs because of emissions, airport closings, the delayed transportation of goods and missed work days.Mr. Purnomo was not prepared to issue a revised estimate, but he said the figure would be considerably higher.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t include social costs, like people dying, and political costs, which will affect the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, there are many other costs to consider.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation\u2019s rescue operations in Central Kalimantan Province, using information from a spokeswoman. The group moved one orangutan to a safer area and brought eight others to a rehabilitation center; it did not move five to safer areas and bring two to the center.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Becky Quick, along with my CNBC colleagues, Carl Quintanilla and John Harwood. Some of CNBC\u2019s experts on the markets and personal finance will be here with us tonight as well.But let\u2019s get right to the debate rules.Candidates will get 30 seconds to answer an opening question and then 60 seconds to answer a formal question. They\u2019ll also get 30 seconds for rebuttals and follow-ups. All of this comes at the discretion of the moderators.We want you to weigh in tonight, either from home or wherever you are. By the way, if you check it out on the bottom of the screen, you can see your tweets right there using #cnbcgopdebate. You can also go to cnbc.com/vote throughout the night to tell us where you stand.First up, let\u2019s get right to the candidates for tonight\u2019s Republican Presidential Debate. I want to run you through the line on the stage from left to right.First up, Governor Bobby Jindal.(APPLAUSE)QUICK: Senator Rick Santorum.Governor George Pataki.And Senator Lindsey Graham.Obviously we have a lot to cover here tonight so let\u2019s get this started.My colleague, John Harwood, has our first question \u2014 John.JOHN HARWOOD, CNBC HOST: We\u2019re going to pose this question to all candidates and go left to right, starting with Governor Jindal.Governor, a majority of Republican voters at this point in the campaign have made clear that they prefer someone from outside the political system.In 30 seconds, tell us why your experience inside the system would be more valuable than the fresh eyes an outsider would bring.BOBBY JINDAL (R), GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA: I think the reason voters are so frustrated is nothing seems to change in D.C. Look, over the next several hours, you\u2019re going to hear several Republicans all tell you they want to shrink the size of government and grow the American economy and it sounds great and we\u2019ve got to do it.Here\u2019s the truth \u2014 of all these folks talking, I\u2019m the only one that has cut the size of government. There\u2019s not two of us, there\u2019s one of us. The rest of it is all just hot air. When politicians talk, we need to pay attention to what they do, not what they say.I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s reduced the size of government. Let\u2019s shrink the government economy. Let\u2019s grow the American economy.HARWOOD: Thanks, Governor Jindal.Senator Santorum?RICK SANTORUM, FORMER SENATOR: Yes, I think it\u2019s one thing to shrink the size of a state government but it\u2019s another thing to actually get something accomplished in Washington. It\u2019s a much tougher field.And I\u2019m the one in the \u2014 on this stage and, frankly, on both stages that has actually gone to Washington, said we would shrink government, said we would shake things up and actually delivered for the conservative cause, everything from welfare reform, which was the largest, most significant accomplishment in the last 25 years for conservatism.I authored the bill when I was in the House of Representatives; I managed the bill on the floor of the United States Senate. You need a conservative who can deliver and that\u2019s what I bring to the table.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator.Governor Pataki?GEORGE PATAKI, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: We need an outsider to run our party and to win the next election. Washington has become a corrupt insider game and everybody talks about how they\u2019re going to change the taxes, grow the economy. Nothing seems to change.But, by the way, Bobby, I shrunk the size of New York State\u2019s government when I left. We had reduced the employment by over 25,000 and cut taxes.But I understand that to change Washington you have to understand government as well. You can\u2019t just be an outsider. You can\u2019t just be someone who throws stones at Washington. You have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.I can do that, I will do that if I have the chance to lead this party.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.Senator Graham.GRAHAM: Well, number one, thank you for having me here tonight.How about a round of applause for Boulder, Colorado?This is a beautiful place.(APPLAUSE)GRAHAM: Looking at their academic standards, the only way I could have gotten into this university is to be invited to this debate tonight.(LAUGHTER)GRAHAM: But here\u2019s my take on things. Without national security, there is no economic security. Without the sacrifice of the veteran, all of our hopes and dreams are at risk.Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton said that the problems with the V.A. are being exaggerated by Republicans. They are not, they are real.HARDWOOD: Senator Graham, thank you very much. Becky?QUICK: Governor Jindal, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the news of the day. Just a few hours ago, the Republicans and the Democrats in the House voted on a budget deal that will increase spending by about $80 billion dollars over the next two years. You, however, have called the Republicans who have been willing to work with the Democrats to do things like this the, \u201cSurrender Party of the Republican caucus.\u201dWould you have shut the government down instead?JINDAL: Well, look, I think that\u2019s a false choice. I think this is a very bad deal. Whenever they tell us in D.C. they\u2019re going to cut tomorrow, that means they\u2019re never going to cut. Tomorrow never seems to happen. Instead, why don\u2019t we actually follow our conservative principles? Why not insist on structural reforms? Why not cut spending?I don\u2019t mean strength (ph) the growth rate, I mean, actually spend less. Why not a balanced budget in the amendment \u2014 an amendment to the Constitution? Why not a super-majority vote before they grow our taxes, before they grow the government faster than the economy?Let\u2019s be honest, $18 trillion dollars of debt. Record low participation rate in the workforce, record number of Americans on food stamps. We are going the way of Europe. The left is trying to turn the American Dream into the European Nightmare. If you\u2019re a Republican...QUICK: ...But Governor...JINDAL: ...(INAUDIBLE) willing to stand up and fight...QUICK: ...if you didn\u2019t have a choice, if you didn\u2019t control things in the house, would you take the choice of shutting things down, or would you go ahead and agree with them?JINDAL: I think that\u2019s a false choice. If I were \u2014 I were to lead, we would pass a conservative budget, challenge the President to do the right thing. And, here\u2019s the problem, the Republicans never want to fight. Give Pelosi and Reed credit, they forced Obamacare and socialism down our throats, why won\u2019t the Republicans fight half as hard for freedom and opportunity. This was a bad budget.QUICK: Governor, thank you.PATAKI: Becky, can I comment on this question?HARDWOOD: Just hold on, Governor Pataki, we\u2019re going to go to Senator Graham on this question because we believe you are likely to be the only person on this stage tonight who supports this budget deal. Now, you just heard Governor Jindal say that it\u2019s a phony deal, it doesn\u2019t do anything, and people like you are surrendering rather than fighting by supporting it. Why is he wrong?GRAHAM: Well, let me tell you what is real. The threat to our homeland. I\u2019ve never seen so many threats to our homeland than I do today. Barack Obama is an incompetent Commander in Chief. There are more terrorist organizations with safe havens to attack the American homeland than anytime since 9/11. We\u2019re in the process of reducing our defense spending by half.I am looking at this budget with one view in mind, will it restore the ability to defend this nation. We\u2019re on track to have the smallest army since 1940, the smallest navy since 1915, this budget, if it is paid for, will put $40 billion dollars back in the defense department at a time we need it.The number one role of the federal government\u2019s to defend this nation, I intend to be a Commander in Chief that can win a war we cannot afford to lose.HARDWOOD: Thank you, Senator Graham...PATAKI: ...John, can I quickly comment on this one...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: ...Governor, we\u2019re going to get to you in just a moment, we\u2019re going to try to keep this shorter...PATAKI: ...But, I want to speak on this issue...QUINTANILLA: ...Question, in the meantime, for Senator Santorum. You have advocated a flat tax, so we\u2019d like to ask you about fairness. Why is it fair to tax all Americans at the same rate, as opposed to taxing more affluent Americans at higher rates?SANTORUM: Well, if you look at my flat tax, it actually takes the best of what Steve Forbes, Art Laffer (ph), many have been advocating for a long time, which is a very strong pro-growth tax code \u2014 very simple. And, it adjusts it to make sure that it is not regressive.We have a $2,750 per person tax credit \u2014 that\u2019s $2,750 off the taxes due, not a deduction, a credit. And, we think \u2014 in fact, if you run the numbers, no American who\u2019s going to be paying more taxes under our proposal, so, we\u2019ve accomplished both.We have a system that has a low single rate, but we take care of American families. I\u2019m talking about $2,750 per person. That means a family four, that\u2019s $11,000 dollar tax credit. That\u2019s a very, very strong pro-family \u2014 and if you looked at the Wall Street Journal today, and so many of the publications that have been out there, they\u2019ve talked about how the biggest problem of the hollowing out of the middle of this country. For workers to be able to raise is actually, the breakdown of the American family.William Galston (ph), a liberal, said that on the pages of the Wall Street Journal today that the key to poverty is families. So, we put forth a pro-growth \u2014 Steve Forbes plan, combined it with a pro- family plan, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s going to work out, and work effectively.QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John \u2014 Becky?QUICK: Governor Pataki, let\u2019s get to your point. You wanted to make a comment on the budget. You want to get in on the idea, what would you do if you were in Washington? Would you compromise...PATAKI: ...I think it was a bad deal, but I would have voted for it for a very simple reason. Barack Obama is the first president in American history to hold our military hostage. He knew that we needed funding for overseas contingency operations, $40 million dollars that would go to support our troops. And, he was prepared, and had vetoed it, unless this deal went through.I have two sons, they both served overseas. One in Iraq, and one in Afghanistan, and I understand that we have got to do far more to help our military, help our veterans, and help protect our security. This is a bad deal, but to protect our military, I would have signed it. Uh, it\u2019s not going to be the case, if I have a chance to lead this country, we\u2019re going to reduce the deficit, shrink the government, lower the tax burden and grow the private sector because that\u2019s how you solve deficits.QUICK: Governor Pataki, thank you.John?PATAKI: Thank you.HARWOOD: Governor Jindal, a question about fiscal policy, especially since you noted that this deal doesn\u2019t solve the long-term debt situation.When you came into office with a budget surplus in the state of Louisiana, now, years later, the state legislature faced a $1.6 billion budget gap and the Republican state treasurer called one of your approaches to that problem \u201cnonsense on a stick,\u201d quoting him.Are you going to do for the federal budget what you did for the Louisiana budget?JINDAL: Absolutely, Jhon. And what we did is we cut state spending. We\u2019ve cut our budget 26 percent, according to Cato and other analysis, the only candidate that\u2019s actually reduced government spending.Look, the left always complains there\u2019s not enough money for government. We have 30,000 fewer state employees than the day I took office, eight credit upgrades, we\u2019re a top 10 state for private sector job creation.We\u2019ve got a choice. You grow the government economy or the American economy. When I became governor, we had 25 years in a row of outmigration. We were coming back from Katrina. The question many were asking, will Louisiana rebuild, should Louisiana rebuild?Seven years in a row, more people moving into the state than were leaving the state.We now have more people working than ever before, erg a higher income than ever before.Yes, we\u2019ve reduced the size of government. That\u2019s exactly what we need to do in DC. In DC, the Republicans slowed the growth rate, they claimed victory. That\u2019s not enough.Let\u2019s be honest with where we are today. We are running off of a cliff. Look, we\u2019ll be the next Greece and we can talk and we can rearrange the chairs. Over over $18 trillion of debt, no wonder our economy has been stagnant. We haven\u2019t had real growth.If you\u2019re a young student here, you\u2019ve not seen a robust American economy.HARWOOD: But Governor Jindal, as you know, many Republicans are opposed to the approach that you\u2019ve taken in Louisiana. They complain that you have tried so hard to avoid anything that could be called a tax increase so that you could run for president saying you\u2019d never raised taxes, David Vitter, the Republican who\u2019s now running to succeed you, has told voters, I won\u2019t be like Jindal, I\u2019m not using the governorship as a stepping stone to higher office.JINDAL: Well, Jhon, a couple of things.Not only did we not raise taxes, we did the largest income tax cut in the state\u2019s history. And I\u2019m proud of that record. I think that\u2019s the kind of leadership voters want in DC.Look, if you want a Republican that\u2019s going go grow government spending, if you want a \u2014 a president or if you want a candidate who\u2019s going to income taxes, I\u2019m not your guy.If you want somebody that\u2019s going to do and say the things that can\u2019t be said, can\u2019t be done, I\u2019m asking a vote for me to join my cause. That\u2019s how dangerous these times are. This is \u2014 this is a \u2014 this is \u2014 these are dangerous times for America. I think we have a chance to rescue the idea of America, but if we don\u2019t do it now, four years will be too late from now.So, yes, I\u2019m proud we cut taxes, we cut spending, 30,000 fewer state government bureaucrats than the day I took office. I absolutely will do that in DC.HARWOOD: Governor Jindal, thank you.JINDAL: Thank you.HARWOOD: We\u2019re going to take a quick break.The Republican presidential debate continues live from Boulder, Colorado in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)QUINTANILLA: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live in boulder, Colorado, on cNBC. We resume our questions now with Jim Cramer, the host of cNBC\u2019s Mad Money.CRAMER: Thank you. Governor Pataki, in the wake of the Sony hack last year, you said, quote, \u201cat the very least, we should declare cyber-war on North Korea.\u201dWhat does a cyber-war look like? And if our companies are getting attacked by foreign governments, do we need a military response?PATAKI: No, I don\u2019t think we need a military response, but we need a coordinated response. And I have to say that I think the Obama administration has been completely lax, to say the least, in dealing with these cyber-attacks, not just by governments like North Korea, but by, particularly, Chinese and other companies.And what I would do is put in place a policy where if we know a company, say, a Chinese company, is hacking into American companies, stealing trade secrets, as we know they do every day, we will retaliate against that company and say that that company\u2019s not going to be allowed to continue to do trade with the United States.I would also look at what we\u2019re doing at the federal level and put in place what Israel has done: a \u2014 one federal agency dealing with cybersecurity and charged with working across silos to make sure we have the best technology.And, Jim, I\u2019ve gotta tell you something, talking about cybersecurity. Hillary Clinton put a server, an unsecure server, in her home as secretary of state. We have no doubt that that was hacked, and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and others.That alone should disqualify her from being president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CRAMER: Senator Graham, you\u2019re a hawk. Was that tough enough?GRAHAM: Here\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re being walked all over because our commander in chief is weak in the eyes of our enemies. Do you think Putin would be in the Ukraine today if Ronald Reagan were president? Why are the Chinese stealing our intellectual property, hacking into our system? Why are they building islands over resource-rich waters? Because they can get away with it.At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, the foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be replaced, and the last person you want to find to replace his foreign policy is his secretary of state.So to the Chinese, when it comes to dealing with me, you\u2019ve got a clenched fist or an open hand. You pick. The party\u2019s over, to all the dictators. Make me commander-in-chief and this crap stops.(APPLAUSE)CRAMER: Thank you, Senator.Senator Santorum. We know that a troubling amount of air pollution on the west coast comes from China. Should we enact a pollution tax on products imported from China and give our manufacturers a level playing field?SANTORUM: What we should be \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be putting tariffs on anything. That hurts working men and women in this country. What we should be doing is making our manufacturing more competitive.One of the reasons I introduced the 20/20 plan, a 20 percent flat tax on corporations, as well as on individuals, is so we can be competitive, so we can bring those manufacturing jobs back.You want to talk about cutting pollution? You do a little back- of-the-envelope. We \u2014 we produce, per dollar of GDP, about one-fifth of the CO2 and other pollutants that China produces. So we\u2019re five times more efficient in producing goods here, as far as the environment \u2014 environment is concerned.Why don\u2019t we \u2014 if we really want to tackle environmental problems, global warming, what we need to do is take those jobs from China and bring them back here to the United States, employ workers in this country.We\u2019ve lost two million jobs \u2014 two million jobs \u2014 under this administration in manufacturing \u2014 15,000 manufacturers have left this country. Why? Because of bad tax policy, bad regulatory policy and, yes, bad trade policy.We need to have a president that\u2019s going to pledge, as I have \u2014 I\u2019m going to make America the number-one manufacturer so working men and women can have good paying jobs again in America.CRAMER: Thank you, Senator. John?HARWOOD: Governor Jindal, Senator Santorum just raised the issue of corporate taxes, and cutting corporate taxes is very popular in your party because our rate, at 35 percent, is one of the highest in the world. But nobody has figured out how to identify a set of loopholes that would allow that tax rate to be lowered. So can you tell us specifically what loopholes you\u2019d do away with?JINDAL: Absolutely, John. I\u2019d go further. My tax plan, like everybody\u2019s, like a lot of Republicans\u2019 \u2014 look, I\u2019d get rid of the death penalty and the marriage penalty, and I\u2019d simplify the brackets to 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent, so that an average middle-class family \u2014 a teacher marries a law enforcement official (ph)...HARWOOD: We\u2019re talking corporate taxes.JINDAL: ...I \u2014 I\u2019m gonna get that. Pays 25 percent today, would pay 10 percent under my plan. But my plan does three things different from other people\u2019s plans.One \u2014 remember, I said 2 percent. I think everybody should pay something, even if it\u2019s only 2 percent. That\u2019s the most important 2 percent in my plan.I know a lot of Republicans brag \u2014 y\u2019all can clap, it doesn\u2019t scare me. Go ahead. I heard some people.There are millions of \u2014 there are millions of folks that wouldn\u2019t pay taxes in Jeb\u2019s plan and Trump\u2019s plan. I think that\u2019s a mistake.In terms of the corporate tax, secondly, I\u2019d get rid of the corporate tax. We do have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. I\u2019d get rid of it. I\u2019d get rid of all the corporate welfare. Make the CEOs pay their same tax rates the way the rest of us do.And third, I\u2019d purposely shrink the size of government. You know, that is a \u2014 that is an intentional feature of my plan. We\u2019ve got a choice: do we grow government \u2014 the government economy, or the American economy?So I say get rid of the corporate tax, bring those jobs and investment here to the United States, stop sending jobs and investment overseas.HARWOOD: Thanks, Governor. Becky?QUICK: Governor Pataki, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s happened on Wall Street. Some of your colleagues in the Republican Party, including some of the people on this stage, have bashed Wall Street. They say that it was largely responsible for the financial crisis.You\u2019re a former governor of New York, and you relied very heavily on Wall Street for income. Do you think they\u2019ve gone too far?PATAKI: I think they have gone too far. I think we\u2019ve seen Wall Street really blossom and do very well while the rest of the country is struggling, and it\u2019s because we have this corrupt connection between Wall Street and Washington.And, John, you were just talking about what loopholes would you get rid of. I would get rid of virtually every single one of them. They cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion a year. I would throw them all out.HARWOOD: So the tax credit right now that we have for domestic manufacturing, which manufacturers say is...PATAKI: No, I wouldn\u2019t. I was going to say...HARWOOD: ...important, you would get rid of that?PATAKI: ...no, I would keep \u2014 first, yes, but what I would do is ii would lower the tax on manufacturing to the lowest in the developed world \u2014 12 percent.We all have plans. I have a plan. We all have plans. My plan, the Tax Foundation said, would create five and a half million new jobs over the next decade.The difference, though, is I will get my plan enacted because, when I was governor of New York, I passed sweeping tax code \u2014 cuts in a Democratic state with a Democratic legislature.I \u2014 you know, Bobby, you\u2019re talking about your tax cuts? I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage, more than everybody on the next stage, combined. By more than the other 49 states, in New York state.I don\u2019t just have a plan. I will enact tax cuts, get rid of those loopholes and make the system fairer for all Americans.QUICK: Governor Pataki, thank you.PATAKI: Thank you.QUICK: Carl?QUINTANILLA: Senator Graham. You have said you believe that climate change is real. You\u2019ve said you accept tax increases as part of a budget deal with Democrats. You\u2019ve co-sponsored a Senate immigration bill providing a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally.Are you in the wrong party\u2019s debate?(LAUGHTER)GRAHAM: No, I \u2014 I think I\u2019m trying to solve problems that somebody had better solve.Now, you don\u2019t have to believe that climate change is real. I have been to the Antarctic. I\u2019ve been to Alaska. I\u2019m not a scientist, and I\u2019ve got the grades to prove it.(LAUGHTER)But I\u2019ve talked to the climatologists of the world, and 90 percent of them are telling me that greenhouse gas effect is real. That we\u2019re heating up the planet. I just want a solution that would be good for the economy, that doesn\u2019t destroy it.I want to fix an immigration system. I\u2019m not gonna tell you, if you like your doctor, you can keep it \u2014 keep him. Do you like your health care, you\u2019re gonna keep it. I\u2019m tired of telling people things that they want to hear, that we know we\u2019re not gonna do.We\u2019re not gonna eliminate the corporate tax. But we can make it lower. We\u2019re going to fix immigration, only if we work together. I want to secure the border because, if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to get hurt and hit again.I want to fix a broken visa system. I want to increase legal immigration, because we\u2019re gonna have a shortage of workers over time. As to the 11 million, I want to talk about fixing the problem. We\u2019re not going to deport 11 million people and their legal citizen children.But we will deport felons. And those who stay will have to learn our language to stay, because I don\u2019t speak it well but look how far I\u2019ve come.(CROSSTALK)GRAHAM: At the end of the day, folks, I am trying to solve a problem and win an election. I am tired of losing.Good God, look who we\u2019re running against. The number one candidate on the other side thought she was flat broke after her and her husband were in the White House for eight years. The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don\u2019t think he ever came back.(LAUGHTER)If we don\u2019t beat these people, who the hell are we going to beat?(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator, you\u2019re well over your minute but thank you for that.We will be back from Boulder, Colorado, in just a moment.(MUSIC PLAYING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC PLAYING)QUICK: Welcome back, everyone. This is the Republican Presidential Debate on CNBC, live from the University of Colorado.Senator Santorum, I\u2019d like to go to you. You have talked an awful lot about how you want to protect American jobs by eliminating the number of immigrants who come into this country.But very recently, the CEO of Toll Brothers (ph) told that he can\u2019t get by without immigrants because they make up more than half of his workforce at this point. We\u2019re not talking about people who are making minimum wage but he can\u2019t find Americans who want to do these jobs for $20-an-hour-plus jobs.What would happen if your plans are successful? What happens and how would we fill that hole in the economy, that gap that\u2019s created?Well, as you know, Becky, we have the lowest labor participation rate in 50 years and we also have the slowest growth in wages in the history of our country, any 20-year period. In fact, the last quarter had the lowest wage growth ever recorded. And so you look at the fact that we\u2019ve brought in 35 million \u2014 35 million legal and illegal immigrants over the last 20 years, more than any period in American history, we have low wages, low participation waits. Maybe \u2014 rates.Maybe there\u2019s something going on like we aren\u2019t \u2014 we aren\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have the \u2014 the right match, right?We don\u2019t \u2014 we aren\u2019t giving the training and the investment in our workers and we\u2019re bringing in people to compete against low wage workers. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.We are \u2014 we have an immigration policy that Senator Graham supported that brings in even more low wage workers into this country. He says he wants to solve problems, that\u2019s great. But you\u2019re not solving problems for American wage earners. You\u2019re not solving problems for workers in America who have seen their wages flat line and have been disaffected enough to leave the workplace.We need to get better training and better skills, including vocational education and \u2014 and training in this \u2014 in those \u2014 and \u2014 and cut \u2014 community colleges. But the bottom line is, we have to make sure that we are not flooding this country...QUICK: All right...SANTORUM: \u2014 with competition...QUICK: Senator, I\u2019m sorry your minute is up.SANTORUM: \u2014 for low wage workers.QUICK: Thank you very much, Senator Santorum.SANTORUM: (INAUDIBLE) and I...QUICK: And Graham, Mr. Graham, yes, that was a question to you, too.GRAHAM: The first thing...QUICK: You have 30 seconds.GRAHAM: \u2014 that we have to do is come to grips with the reality that we\u2019re facing as Americans. In 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security recipient. Today, there\u2019s three. In 20 years, there are two.I want to make sure that no American company leaves America because you can\u2019t find a worker.American workers always get the first preference. But if you can\u2019t find an American worker, after you advertise at a competitive wage, I don\u2019t want you to be at a loss. Bring people in based on merit. Let\u2019s take a broken immigration...QUICK: Senator Graham, thank you.GRAHAM: \u2014 system...QUICK: I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s your 30 seconds...GRAHAM: \u2014 and make a merit-based immigration system that will help our economy. We\u2019re going to need workers in the future.QUICK: Senator Graham...GRAHAM: Let\u2019s just choose rationally.QUICK: Thank you, Senator.(CROSSTALK)QUICK: Gentlemen, hold on a second.PATAKI: Let me \u2014 let me try to get a word in edgewise.QUICK: Go ahead,SANTORUM: That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.PATAKI: In Washington, they talk over each other...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each one...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s have \u2014 let Governor Pataki have a chance to speak.PATAKI: Yes. Very simply, you guys talk over each other in Washington all the time. I\u2019m not used to that. I listen when people talk.We have a skills gap. You mentioned the construction company. The construction industry says one of their biggest problems are they can\u2019t find the craftsmen to do the work.What we have to...(CROSSTALK)PATAKI: \u2014 do in America is honor blue collar work again. We have to honor the carpenter, the plumber, the electrician, who can actually build something and instead of just saying that a college degree live \u2014 delivers prestige, let\u2019s celebrate those who do things with their hands and elevate their skills using training in high school and community...QUICK: Governor Pataki...PATAKI: \u2014 colleges so that we can...QUICK: \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was a...(CROSSTALK)PATAKI: \u2014 have a better quality workforce that we honor...QUICK: Governor Pataki...PATAKI: \u2014 as they build America\u2019s future.QUICK: I\u2019m sorry to talk over you, sir.That was a minute.PATAKI: Thank you.QUICK: Thank you very much.PATAKI: Thank you.QUICK: Carl?QUINTANILLA: My question for Governor Jindal, Paul Ryan says he would take the speaker job if it did not take away from his family time. The Department of Labor says 13 percent of American workers are eligible for paid family leave and the U.S. is the only developed nation in the world not to have guaranteed paid maternity leave for new moms.Should the government work to change that?JINDAL: Look, I think the government should work to change that, but that doesn\u2019t \u2014 does not mean I\u2019m for the government mandating that.We already have too many government mandates out of DC.Do I want people to have paid leave?Sure.Do I want people to earn higher wages?Sure.Do I want them to have better benefits?Sure. The government can\u2019t wave a magic wand and make that happen.Here\u2019s the problem. The last seven years, President Obama has tried to teach the American people that government is the answer to all of our problems.Where has that gotten us?We\u2019re on a path toward socialism. The way that folks can get better paying jobs with better benefits is if we have a growing economy. That means to repeal all of ObamaCare, a lower flatter tax code.That means that we have an energy plan that makes sense. That means that we embrace an all of the above approach to energy. Those are good paying jobs \u2014 $50,000, $70,000, $90,000 a year jobs with benefits.But this president won\u2019t let us produce more energy on our domestic federal lands and waters. He won\u2019t allow the Canadians to build the Keystone Pipeline. He\u2019s got an EPA that\u2019s doing everything they can to kill private sector jobs in America.So, yes, I want families to have better paying jobs and better benefits, but we\u2019re not going to get that with a government mandate, we\u2019re going to get that with a growing economy.QUINTANILLA: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: John?HARWOOD: Senator Graham, Americans have gotten used to seeing headlines about more and more big corporations relocating overseas to cut their tax bill. Now, many in Washington think the way to stop that is to lower our corporate tax rate.But as we\u2019ve seen, tax reform takes time. It hasn\u2019t happened yet.In the meantime, do you fault those companies for leaving?Do companies owe anything to their country, as well as their shareholders?GRAHAM: We owe to every businessperson and worker in America the best environment in the world to create a job. We owe that to American businesses. Thirty-five percent corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world.We need to lower it so they don\u2019t leave. The goal is to help the middle class. We can talk about corporations all day long but my goal is to help the middle class, somebody who makes too much to be on government assistance but still lives paycheck to paycheck.When the kid gets sick you don\u2019t go on vacation.(CROSSTALK)GRAHAM: That\u2019s the purpose of my presidency, to grow the economy here. And let me tell you, our Democratic friends have a list a mile long of more government. That\u2019s not going to grow the middle class, that\u2019s going to create a burden on your children, which they\u2019re already overburdened. The best way to grow the middle class is to make it a good place to create a job.You know why Boeing came to South Carolina when they could have gone anywhere to build the 787?Because we wanted them. We had a low-tax structure.HARWOOD: Senator Graham.GRAHAM: A permitting structure that allowed them to build the building even faster than they thought they could build it. We welcomed them there. I\u2019m going to take the South Carolina attitude \u2014HARWOOD: I want to remind candidates, you\u2019ve got a one-minute limit on the \u2014 on the response.But I just want to follow up, Senator Graham. Four years ago, the nominee of your party said that corporations are people, too.If that is true, the question is, do they owe any obligation to the country?GRAHAM: I think everybody owes an obligation to the country. The ones that I\u2019m most worried about are the 1 percent of Americans in uniform, who have been fighting this war for 14 years. They need a commander in chief who knows what the hell they\u2019re doing.My first job as President of the United States is to rebuild the military and use it smartly. Admiral Mullen said the debt is a big threat to our national security. He\u2019s right. But people go where they\u2019re welcome when it comes to job creation.If I\u2019m President of the United States you will be welcomed in America.HARWOOD: Senator Graham \u2014GRAHAM: This will be the place to come \u2014HARWOOD: \u2014 thank you very much.GRAHAM: And if I\u2019m president of the United States \u2014HARWOOD: We\u2019re moving on.GRAHAM: \u2014 our enemies \u2014QUICK: You guys are making this just like home. This is just like (INAUDIBLE).(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator, we\u2019re moving on.I\u2019d like to bring on my colleague, Rick Santelli \u2014 Rick.RICK SANTELLI, CNBC HOST: Thanks, John.Governor Pataki.PATAKI: Hey, Rick.SANTELLI: How are you doing tonight?PATAKI: I\u2019m doing great.SANTELLI: Listen, America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, they\u2019ve kept interest rates near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.And, by the way, they had a meeting today, you think they raised rates?No.Shocking, isn\u2019t it?PATAKI: Not at all.SANTELLI: Listen, it\u2019s been a rough ride for American savers and retirees, they really rely on this interest income. And it\u2019s been a bonanza for the stock market, a bonanza.And for investors that like the little bit more risk, it\u2019s been a bonanza for them as well.So I guess what I\u2019m asking is, do you think this policy is fair and do you support it?PATAKI: No, I don\u2019t support it. But let me go back a little bit here. We need to grow our economy faster. We\u2019ve had the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. And it\u2019s because of policy in Washington and policy at the Fed.And let me go back to Washington. In 2009 \u2014HARWOOD: Senator, that \u2014 I mean, Governor, if that\u2019s true, why was our economy limping six years ago and now it\u2019s the strongest in the world?PATAKI: John, no question Barack Obama inherited a economic disaster in 2009.But what did he do?Instead of focusing on pro-growth policies in the economy, he rammed through ObamaCare, the worst law of my lifetime, that hurt small businesses, hurt companies, raised taxes and almost completely eliminated one industry because of its taxes.The Fed had to act. And the Fed did act and appropriately in reducing interest rates but they\u2019ve reduced them now for seven straight years, that\u2019s never happened before. They\u2019ve been zero for way too long.They should raise the rates; the Fed should get out of manipulating the market and the Fed also, by the way, should reduce its balance sheet, $2.7 trillion. Let some of those bonds mature and put the money back in the banking system so our economy can grow.SANTELLI: Thanks, Governor.Senator Santorum, in the 2012 presidential debate, you were for the export-import bank, which facilitates government funding for U.S. exports. American companies like GE and Boeing are among the beneficiaries.But you said that killing the bank here \u2014 and I\u2019m going to quote you \u2014 \u201cis the last thing a true conservative should be doing.\u201dI don\u2019t know, government-backed funding isn\u2019t normally what I hear from true conservatives.So why is this situation different?SANTORUM: A true conservative wants to create a level playing field. That\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re \u2014 that\u2019s what government is supposed to do. They\u2019re not supposed to favor one group over another.And when it comes to our manufacturers, the level playing field is not in the United States. It\u2019s international. And so the federal government should have laws, tax laws, regulatory laws and, yes, finance laws. There\u2019s 60 other ex-im banks all over \u2014 all over the world.Every major competitor for the United States\u2019 manufacturing dollar has one of those banks.And guess what? They use those banks a heck of a lot more than their \u2014 than the United States of America does, number one.So in order to have a level playing field, which is what conservatives talk about all the time, level playing field, then we have to have export financing and here\u2019s why.Because export financing doesn\u2019t help Boeing, or G.E.G.E. just lost a contract, you know what they did? They went to . They got the X.M. (ph) bank in France to support it, and what did they do? They moved manufacturing out of South Carolina, out of Texas, moved to \u2014 Hungary, and to France. G.E. is still making money. G.E. is still doing well, but American workers are out of jobs. That\u2019s why we have to have this level playing field so we can compete with the rest of the world.MALE: Thank you, Senator.QUINTANILLA: CNBC\u2019s coverage of the Republican presidential debate continues, live from the University of COlorado after this short break.(APPLAUSE)(INAUDIBLE)(INAUDIBLE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)QUINTANILLA: Welcome back to the University of Colorado, and the Republican Presidential Debate on CNBC.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: A question for Senator Santorum. People in this state have loved Coors Beer since it was founded in 1873. I can atest...(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)Now, the brewer later became part of SABMiller, but, now SAB may be bought by Budweiser owner, InBev. Is it right to have a third of brewers in this country owned by one company, and do you fear a company that size will have too much power over consumers.SANTORUM: Well, first, since you mention Colorado, I want to thank the people of Colorado because four years ago you \u2014 gave me the honor of winning the nomination out here in the state of Colorado. On a night we won three states, and it catapulted us to win 11 states ultimately, so, I just want to thank you very, very much for that support, and \u2014 in response to that, I do drink a lot of Coors beer, so...(LAUGHTER)I try to help. The answer is pretty simple. The answer is simple. There are no shortage of breweries around the United States of America. I \u2014 I do \u2014 as I travel around the country, I do pints and politics, and I go to breweries all over the place, and there \u2014 there\u2019s almost no town in America anymore that doesn\u2019t have a brewery, so I don\u2019t think we need to worry too much.They\u2019re obviously \u2014 if there\u2019s \u2014 if there\u2019s some anti- competitive issues, you know, we have agencies to look at that. But, no, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not concerned that Americans are not going to have choices in beer.QUINTANILLA: Well, let\u2019s get to that. I mean, another example, for example, is Walgreens.SANTORUM: And I care about, by the way. I care about choices.QUINTANILLA: I\u2019m sure you do.(LAUGHTER)Walgreens/Rite Aid. Big deal, consolidation in drug stores, semiconductors, food. What is the line at which something becomes anti-competitive in your view?SANTORUM: Well, I \u2014 I would say this, that what you\u2019re seeing is \u2014 in health care, you\u2019re seeing a lot of consolidation, and that consolidation is occurring because of Obamacare.You\u2019re seeing it particularly in an area that I am concerned about, and that\u2019s in insurance \u2014 health insurance. You\u2019re seeing the big health insurance companies fold up.You\u2019ve seen Obama try to seed health insurance companies, and they\u2019ve all failed, I think, except one. Why? Because we have a system of Obamacare with minimum loss ratios that make it virtually impossible for a small insurer to operate effectively.And this was the motive behind Obamacare. This wasn\u2019t incidental. This was deliberate, to make it so impossible for small insurers to survive...QUINTANILLA: Senator.SANTORUM: ...that they consolidate into a small group. Then the left can say, \u201cthere is no competition, we need a single payer.\u201d That\u2019s why we have to repeal Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Thank you. Becky.QUICK: Governor Jindal, I want to go back to something that you mentioned before with your tax plan. I know that you want to put a 2 percent tax on all families, just to make sure everyone has some skin in the game.But every working American pays 6.2 percent, when it comes to Social Security taxes. They pay another 1.45 percent of Medicare. Isn\u2019t that skin in the game?JINDAL: A couple things. You\u2019re talking about payroll taxes that fund programs. People pay for their Medicare, they pay for their Social Security.I want every American to worry and care about how those folks in D.C. are spending our money. If $18 trillion of debt \u2014 they\u2019re misspending our money. Earned success is so much more fulfilling than unearned success.I don\u2019t want us to continue to create one class of Americans that pays income taxes, that pays for government, another class of Americans that\u2019s growing more and more dependent on government.That\u2019s what we have today. Socialism is bad, not only for taxpayers, but people that they say they\u2019re trying to help. There\u2019s dignity in work, dignity in self-sufficiency.I wanna quote you a president. Our (ph) previous president said this: he said, \u201cthe problem is, is that tax rates are too high, government income revenues are too low.\u201dHe said, \u201cparadoxically, lowering tax rates now is the best way to produce higher government revenues later.\u201d No, that wasn\u2019t President Reagan, as many are probably guessing at home. That was President Kennedy.I see you know the answer. That was President Kennedy. Imagine if he were alive today \u2014 and if he was at that last Democratic debate, imagine if you tried to say that in a party that\u2019s veering towards socialism. That wouldn\u2019t be welcome in today\u2019s Democratic party.QUICK: Governor, thank you.HARWOOD: Governor Pataki, you\u2019ve indicated you believe climate change is real and caused at least in part by human activity. So, in 60 seconds, tell us what the federal government should do about it.PATAKI: Yeah, absolutely. I \u2014 one of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts. I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous that, in the 21st century, we\u2019re questioning whether or not vaccines are the appropriate way to go. Of course they are. And it\u2019s also not appropriate to think that human activity, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, doesn\u2019t make the earth warmer. All things being equal, it does. It\u2019s uncontroverted.I think part of the problem is that Republicans think about climate change, say, \u201coh my God, we\u2019re gonna have higher taxes, more Obama, more big government, the EPA shutting down factories.\u201dThat\u2019s not the solution that I see. I want Republicans to embrace innovation and technology. You know, there\u2019s one country in the world that has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the rest of \u2014 of the world. You know what that is? The United States.Our emissions are lower than they were in 1995. Not because of a \u2014 of a government program, but because of fracking, private sector creation...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Is there a role for government?PATAKI: ...replace coal plants \u2014 government\u2019s roles \u2014 is to incentivize innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit in America. We could have far more clean energy.We could have next-generation nuclear, thorium reactors that have no risk of meltdown. We could have solar panels on every home that are four times more efficient than today.HARWOOD: So, subsidies for those programs? For \u2014 for those alternative energy sources?PATAKI: R&D \u2014 R&D credits. Let the private sector do this, develop this innovation. And not only would we solve our problems, we would have clean energy, cheaper energy here.We could export those technologies to places like China and like India so we would grow our economy, have a far greater impact globally, have a secure domestic source of energy, and cleaner, healthier air.That\u2019s the solution. Embrace science, embrace innovation and change.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Carl?(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Question for Senator Santorum.SANTORUM: Thank you. Can I just say something about that?QUINTANILLA: After this question maybe.(LAUGHTER)The 2015 Nobel Prize winner for economics argues that slow growth causes poverty, and that leads to inequality. What would you do to ease inequality? And what would you do solve poverty? By the way, thanks to Larry Kudlow, CNBC, for this question.SANTORUM: Well, if you look at our plan that I introduced, the 2020 Clear Vision for America, we increase growth by 10 percent, 1 percent a year. So we go from 2.3 to 3.3, in repealing Obamacare, it\u2019s another .7. So you\u2019re looking at 4 percent growth, according to the Tax Foundation.And unlike Donald Trump and Bobby Jindal, we don\u2019t add $10 trillion to the deficit. In fact, our plan, while it creates as many jobs as their plan does and grows the economy as much as theirs does, we are a revenue-neutral plan because I believe that we need to reduce the size of government, yes, but we also need to reduce our deficit, and we need to get our budget balanced so we can start paying down this debt. And adding a trillion dollars with a tax cut and getting no more growth is not the way to do it.But that\u2019s only half of it. The word \u201ceconomy\u201d comes from the Greek \u201ceuthokis\u201d (ph) which means family. The family is the first economy. And the one thing that we do not talk about enough is how stable families are vitally important for the middle of America to be prosperous and to grow and be safe. And I will have policies, not just tax policies, but others that will make sure that families are strong again in America.QUINTANILLA (?): Governor Jindal, I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds on this.JINDAL: Well, thank you.Look, if Senator Santorum wants to concede the tax cut wing of the Republican Party, I\u2019m happy to fight for that side of the Republican Party. He\u2019s exactly right. I explicitly want to shrink the size of government; 22 percent over 10 years is not too much. We cut our state budget 26 percent in eight years.This is a fundamental choice. We mustn\u2019t become a cheaper version of the Democratic Party, a second liberal party. We need to proudly say we\u2019re willing to cut taxes, shrink government, grow the American economy. President Kennedy said it to the Democratic Party. Why can\u2019t we say it in the Republican Party in 2015, let\u2019s cut taxes.HARWOOD: Governor, if you cut spending and cut government so much, why did your legislature have such a big deficit?JINDAL: John, our budget is balanced. We balanced our budget every year for eight years. Yeah, we\u2019ve had to cut spending. You know what? We privatized or closed nine of our 10 charity hospitals. We did statewide school choice; $1.6 billion (ph) budget cut.You\u2019re quoting an old number from the beginning of the year. We closed that gap. What they talk about, just like D.C., government\u2019s the only place where you give them less money than they wanted, they count it as a cut. They take last year\u2019s budget. They add inflation. They call it a baseline. We need to do zero-based budgets. We need to say just because you got money last year, you don\u2019t have it this year.Let me close, though. We balanced our budget. We didn\u2019t raise taxes. In eight years, we never raised taxes. We cut taxes. Our \u2014 our taxpayers, our families have been better off for it.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: No, we\u2019re going to move on. I\u2019m going to bring on my colleague Sharon Epperson.EPPERSON: Thank you, John.Senator Graham, one in every four workers has saved less than $1,000 for retirement. Millions of Americans rely on their Social Security benefits for the majority of their retirement income. Now, you called for reforms to Social Security, but what would you do to fix the other part of the problem for future retirees and get people to save more?GRAHAM: Well, number one, Social Security is not just a concept to me. I know why it exists; 50 percent of today\u2019s seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. I promise you, if you make me your president, I will save Social Security because I know why it exists.Now, if you\u2019re looking for good beer policy, I\u2019m your best bet. My dad owned a bar.(LAUGHTER)I know beer. We grew up, my sister and myself, in the back of that bar in one room with my mom, my dad and my sister who\u2019s nine years younger. When I was 21, my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Neither parent finished high school. She died within a year. We were wiped out from the medical bills. And if it wasn\u2019t for a Social Security survivor benefit check coming into my family, we wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have made it because my dad died 15 months later.So I...EPPERSON: But Senator Graham...GRAHAM: Wait a minute, please. I\u2019m 22 and we\u2019re wiped out. I am 60. I\u2019m not married. I have a military retirement. I\u2019m in good shape. I would give up some of my benefits to help those who need it more than I do.To young people here, I will ask you to work a little bit longer because we have to. The purpose of my presidency is to save this country and to save Social Security by working across the aisle just like Ronald Reagan. This is the biggest issue facing this nation.EPPERSON: Thank you, Senator Graham. Thank you, Senator Graham.Governor Jindal, you\u2019ve been a strong supporter of for-profit colleges. These are institutions that educate many veterans, minorities and working class Americans. They make up about 11 percent of the college population at these schools, but they account for 44 percent of student loan defaults. Should for-profit schools be held accountable when they take taxpayer money and leave students deep in debt?JINDAL: (INAUDIBLE) absolutely they should be accountable. They should be accountable to their students through the market. Look, you either trust the American people to make their own choices or you don\u2019t.I know the Left thinks we need to be protected from ourselves. President Obama is trying to limit competition to the higher education market. As a result, you\u2019re going to see tuition prices continue to go up. We\u2019ve had $1 trillion of student debt and counting. And he wants to exempt certain schools from the same oversight he wants to apply only to the for-profit market.For some reason, the private sector is a bad word to this president. It\u2019s not in the real world.In Louisiana, we fought so that the dollars follow the child and so the child following the dollar. What that means, from K-12, what that means is that parents and their families can decide what\u2019s the best way for their children to be educated. Higher education, we have a TOPS program, where, again, we will help if a student maintains a 20 ACT, 2.5 GPA, we\u2019ll pay for their tuition. They can take those dollars for private school of their choice in the state as well.You either trust the American people or you don\u2019t. I know the Left doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why you get ObamaCare. They want to tell us what kind of insurance to buy. That\u2019s why you get Common Core, they want to take away our gun rights under the Second Amendment. They want to take away our religious liberty rights.So, yes, there\u2019s accountability. There\u2019s accountability to students through choice and competition. We don\u2019t need the nanny state to protect us from ourselves.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Governor Jindal.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: And thank you, Sharon (ph).This is the Republican Presidential Debate, live from Boulder, Colorado. We\u2019ll be right back.(MUSIC PLAYING) (APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)QUICK: Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado, and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.Gentlemen, this is our lightning round, where we have some questions for you we hope you can answer in 20 seconds or less. And we will go right down the line on this.Governor Jindal, I\u2019ll start with you.We\u2019re wondering, what are the three apps that you use most frequently on your cellphone?JINDAL: I was just saying to my colleagues, I may be the last person in this audience without an iPhone. I\u2019m actually one of the last folks \u2014 I still have a BlackBerry in my pocket. And I basically use it for scheduling. I use it to keep up when my wife is here and my three kids at home.The only games on that phone are Bricklayer. I use it to keep up with the news through the Internet. I may be the last American out there without an iPhone.QUICK: No, no.JINDAL: My apologies.QUICK: I \u2014 I\u2019m with you. I still have a BlackBerry, too.Senator \u2014 Senator Santorum, how about you?SANTORUM: MLB, NHL, so I\u2019m a big sports fan. And \u201cThe Wall Street Journal.\u201d Those are the three apps I use the most.QUICK: Thank you.Governor?PATAKI: The one I use the most is Uber. You know, I used to get driven...(LAUGHTER)PATAKI: \u2014 when I was governor, I had a driver. I don\u2019t anymore, but...(CROSSTALK)PATAKI: And it\u2019s an example of what millennials are doing to change America for the better. And I tweet a lot, too.So Uber, Tweet \u2014 Twitter and then I communicate with my family.QUICK: Thank you.Senator Graham?GRAHAM: Well, number one, the only reason I have an iPhone is because I gave my number to Donald Trump. Don\u2019t do that.(LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor...GRAHAM: Donald has done more to upgrade my technology than my whole staff.Number one, Fox News. Sorry about CNBC.(LAUGHTER)GRAHAM: We\u2019re in a Republican primary here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks. Thanks a lot.QUICK: We take your time back. Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Time is up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cut his microphone.QUINTANILLA: We\u2019ve got one more. One more lightning round.Governor Jindal, should the day after the Super Bowl be a national holiday?(LAUGHTER)JINDAL: Well, absolutely, when the Saints go back to repeat, we were talking about beer sales earlier, all those folks from being hung over in Louisiana from drinking to celebrate Drew Brees winning this, I think it would be a great day to take off.No, look, on a serious note, I do want to say this about the Super Bowl and our athletes. They can be great role models for our children and I\u2019m obviously a Saints fan. Drew Brees and his wife great role models, great Christians.So, yes, it should be a holiday.QUINTANILLA: Senator?SANTORUM: Well, since we\u2019re usually in the Super Bowl at the Pittsburgh Steelers...Steeler nation, anybody?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.SANTORUM: No. I was in...(CROSSTALK)SANTORUM: \u2014 I was in Kansas City over the weekend to watch the Steeler game and about a third of the crowd were Steeler fans. So I\u2019m usually not alone when I call on Steeler Nation.But we are used to being in the Super Bowl, so actually, it is in Pennsylvania already.QUINTANILLA: Governor?PATAKI: I \u2014 I am a long suffering Jets fan. So my answer is obviously no, there\u2019s no reason to take off the day after the Super Bowl.(APPLAUSE)PATAKI: But let me just add this. The Mets are going to win tonight. Let\u2019s go, Mets.QUINTANILLA: Finally, Senator?GRAHAM: Well, I think a national holiday would be the day that commander-in-chief Barack Obama doesn\u2019t have that job.(APPLAUSE)GRAHAM: But unlike these other three, I want to win New Hampshire. Go Tom Brady. Go Patriots.(LAUGHTER)GRAHAM: Sorry, Colorado is late in the...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Panderer.(CROSSTALK)QUICK: Jhon?HARWOOD: OK, now we\u2019re at the point of the evening where we\u2019re just about to give our candidates a holiday from this debate, but not before they tell us in 30 seconds their closing statements.Senator Graham, you\u2019re first.GRAHAM: Somebody said \u2014 or maybe I saw it on the bill of a cap \u2014 that let\u2019s make America great again.(LAUGHTER)GRAHAM: America is great.(APPLAUSE)GRAHAM: I intend to make America strong again. I\u2019m going to be the champion of the middle class, where I came from. If you make me your president, our best days are ahead. I\u2019m ready to be commander- in-chief, ladies and gentlemen, on day one. I intend to war \u2014 win a war that we cannot afford to lose.I will be a commander-in-chief worthy of the sacrifice of those brave Americans who have been defending our nation. They have had our back. God knows, they have had our back... HARWOOD: Senator Graham...GRAHAM: \u2014 and I intend to have their back as commander-in- chief. Make me commander-in-chief.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator Graham.Governor Pataki?PATAKI: Thank you for the opportunity to be with this great audience tonight.I\u2019m a limited government conservative and I mean by that that not just when it comes to economic issues leaving them to the state, but social issues, as well.And in that I differ from every single other candidate seeking the Republican nomination.I take the Tenth Amendment very, very seriously.I\u2019m a Republican who embraces science and understands we have to work with the next generation of millennials to have the innovation and technology so that we can grow a 21st century economy.And I\u2019m a Republican who understands in Washington, when you\u2019re a leader, you have to put aside partisan politics to do what\u2019s right for the people.We are one America. If we work together across party lines, there\u2019s no problem we can\u2019t solve and the 21st century will be America\u2019s greatest century.Thank you very much.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: I grew up in a steel town of Western Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh, and when I announced for president, I announced from the factory floor. When I talk about making America the number one manufacturer again in the world, it\u2019s not just talk. When I talk about having the opportunity for people to rise again, it\u2019s not just because it polls well.I represented the old steel valley of Pittsburgh. I represented a 70% Democratic district, and won with 60% of the vote. Why? Because I aligned myself with working men and women who feel that neither party, and certainly not Washington D.C. cares about them.You elect me, we will get American workers on the side of the Republican party, and we can not be stopped if we do.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Senator Santorum, thank you. Governor Jindal?JINDAL: My message is to conservatives, this is our hour. Thanks to the insanity, the incompetence of the Democratic party, the American people are ready to turn our government over to us. It\u2019s not enough to let just any Republican, however. The reality is the idea of America is slipping away.As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty. As Americans, we believe that our best days are always ahead of us, and they can be again. We must win this election. We cannot allow Hillary Clinton to take us down this path towards socialism \u2014 further down this path.I\u2019ve got the courage to apply our conservative principles. I can\u2019t do it alone. With your help, with God\u2019s grace, we can save the idea of America before it\u2019s too late.HARWOOD: Governor Jindal, thank you very much.

{"Headline": "Putting the Past Behind in China", "Date": "2015-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Oil & MoneyHONG KONG \u2014 The days of China\u2019s relying on export manufacturing and infrastructure construction as drivers of economic growth are gone. China\u2019s service sector is now larger than its manufacturing sector and growth of gross domestic product is slowing, fueling seismic shifts in current and future energy demand against a background of complex developmental and political factors.China\u2019s official G.D.P. growth in the second quarter of this year was 7 percent, but power demand growth for the same period was a mere 1.6 percent. Oil consumption is growing at half the rate of just a few years ago, and in the first four months of 2015, coal consumption dropped 8 percent year on year.On the surface, these numbers paint a picture of a more drastic slowdown than official G.D.P. statistics suggest. But the reality isn\u2019t that simple, said Zhou Xizhou, senior director and head of China Energy at IHS Energy.\u201cIf you look one level deeper, you can see a pattern,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cThe structure of G.D.P. and that of power demand are very different. The numbers are painting a very clear picture of the heavy industrial sector\u2019s energy consumption slowing down.\u201d Because heavy industry represents such a large percentage of energy consumption, small shifts in consumption have a big impact on overall data. Notably, heavy manufacturing accounts for 17 percent of G.D.P., but 41 percent of power demand. Data for the second quarter of this year showed a 0.9 percent year-on-year decline in power consumption by heavy industry, compared with growth in consumption by light industry and the commercial sector of 2.4 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively.\u201cChina went through an extraordinarily high-energy growth period, driven by energy-intensive investments in heavy industries and infrastructure,\u201d said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow at the Energy and National Security Program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThat was bound to slow down.\u201dChinese energy demand has exaggerated and extended global cycles, Mr. Chow said. During a period of high oil prices, Chinese imports grew at a high rate, including a spike of one million barrels per day in 2010, a result of the government stimulus in response to the recent financial crisis.\u201cNow that oil prices have dropped by more than half, along with lower international coal and gas prices, Chinese energy demand and import growth seem to be slowing at a rate lower than official G.D.P. growth numbers,\u201d he said.China\u2019s economy has experienced a bumpy ride this year, when compared with most of the preceding quarter century. This will put the economy front and center for the short term.\u201cThe prospects for the economy will be the most powerful factor shaping China\u2019s energy plan, especially the next five-year plan between 2016 and 2020,\u201d said Tao Wang, resident scholar in the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. The plan is being completed and is expected to be adopted in March 2016.Cheaper oil also raises other issues. How the major state-owned oil companies will fare is a big question, but not as big as in a country like Russia, where oil revenues are vital for the government. An additional question is how much Beijing has done to build up strategic and commercial reserves. \u201cChina appears to be taking advantage of lower prices to build strategic oil stocks, although not much data is available on this,\u201d Mr. Chow said. \u201cData availability, accuracy and transparency in general are challenging in China, including for the authorities themselves.\u201dIn terms of Beijing\u2019s short- to mid-term oil and gas strategy, \u201cthere is general policy confusion at this point, although long-term objectives of diversifying supply sources and routes are unlikely to change,\u201d he added.With major pipeline projects with Russia and other countries either on line or on the way, energy security, once a prime concern for China, is beginning to yield to other more pressing problems. \u201cIn the short term, there will be much less concern regarding security of supply for oil and gas,\u201d Mr. Wang said. The economics of existing deals and investment and how to reform the country\u2019s oil and gas sector in the context of low prices \u2014 and profits \u2014 are moving to the forefront, he said.Because of China\u2019s large consumption base, incremental demand volumes for oil remain large. IHS expects China to continue to be significant in terms of global oil consumption growth, accounting for 30 percent to 40 percent of new oil demand growth through 2020.Last year was a turning point for coal consumption in China\u2019s coastal region, where the first phase of intensive economic development began in the late 1970s. In 2014 coal consumption along the coast peaked, with consumption rising in the central and western regions, Mr. Zhou of IHS said.\u201cThe coast has already peaked for several reasons, including slower growth but also environmental pressure, which has made it difficult to site new coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers,\u201d he said. However, he added, coal consumption will continue to grow, peaking in the 2020s. Now new facilities are being built in the interior, both for power transmission to the coast and to serve indigenous consumption growth.The days of China\u2019s reliance upon coal to produce as much as 75 percent of its electricity are coming to a close, for two reasons. The first is the shift away from an economy focused on industry, which currently accounts for 80 percent of China\u2019s coal consumption. The second is political: Last November, China and the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse emissions, with China pledging to hit a peak for carbon dioxide by 2030.Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and tidal power plus hydropower have received much attention and investment during the past three years. China is the largest investor in renewables, although like other countries, it is struggling to deal with challenges such as enabling the electric grid to handle the intermittency of wind and solar power.\u201cThe renewable energy industry is growing fast in China, despite the slow economy,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThe government is determined to make it a strategic industry for the future, and it will increasingly play a more important role in China\u2019s energy system in the coming decade.\u201dChina has won praise for pushing renewable technology forward, but in terms of immediate environmental impact, it will still be minimal. Renewables account for less than 1 percent of China\u2019s current energy mix.Richard Brubaker, founder of the Shanghai-based consulting firm Collective Responsibility, said that reducing demand by improving building energy efficiency in China\u2019s cities, which will add 300 million residents in the coming decade, should be a developmental focus.\u201cCities really need to start implementing energy efficiency programs, be it through glass curtains, HVAC systems, insulation or other areas,\u201d Mr. Brubaker said. \u201cThese are investments that are nearly impossible to make if relying on developers or investors alone, because of the motive to invest in lowest tech benefits investors who are only concerned in short-term gains.\u201dInstead of heavy investment in renewable energy sources, putting that money into improving building efficiency will have greater returns, he said.\u201cReduce their load 40 percent and you have done far more to improve the sustainability of energy than any investments in solar,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, make the investments in renewable to clean up the remaining supply.\u201dAdvertisement"}
