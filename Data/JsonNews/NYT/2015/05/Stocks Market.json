{"Headline": "German Bonds Do About-Face as Yields Rise", "Date": "2015-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 One of the world\u2019s safest investments has been behaving strangely of late.Only a couple of weeks ago, it looked as if the market interest rate on German government bonds maturing in 10 years was heading inexorably into negative territory, a once unthinkable reversal of the usual relationship between borrowers and lenders.Then, just as the yield on the 10-year bond was flirting with zero, it shot up, rising to 0.37 percent on Monday from 0.07 percent on April 20.Other German bonds that had already sunk into negative territory, including five- and seven-year debt, began paying interest again, if only a little.There was no particular news or economic data significant enough to explain such a sharp move, analysts said, and people who analyze markets for a living are still trying to figure out what happened.But while the abruptness was unsettling, the rise in the yield marks a return to normalcy that provides some relief to insurance companies and pension funds that are obligated to put most of their money into bulletproof assets like German bonds, also known as bunds.The positive yields will probably also be welcomed by the European Central Bank, whose economic stimulus program is largely responsible for pushing market interest rates so low.\u201cThis is the best thing that could happen to the E.C.B.,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.The recovery of German yields helps to quell complaints in Germany that ultralow interest rates were undermining German savers, Mr. Schmieding said. At the same time, borrowing costs for most of the crisis countries like Spain and Italy remain low, just as the central bank intended.\u201cThis blunts the German criticism while still delivering stimulus where it\u2019s needed,\u201d Mr. Schmieding said. \u201cIt\u2019s optimal.\u201dThe recovery of German interest rates will also help ease fears that the central bank was in danger of running out of bonds to buy as part of its so-called quantitative easing program. Since March, the European Central Bank has essentially been printing money and using it to buy government bonds issued by all 19 countries in the eurozone. In the bond market, more demand translates into lower yields.The bond purchases, at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, a month, are a way of pumping money into the eurozone economy.While the rise in German yields is probably welcomed at central bank headquarters in Frankfurt, there are some unnerving aspects.Even the experts were unsure why bunds reversed course. As of Monday, only German bonds maturing in two years or less were still selling at negative yields \u2014 a situation in which lenders were effectively paying borrowers to take care of their money.Michael Heise, the chief economist at the German insurer Allianz, said that central bank stimulus along with a rise in oil prices had caused investors to revise their expectations for future inflation. If investors think inflation will rise, then they will be less willing to tolerate low interest rates on their money.Some investors, for example hedge funds, may have been betting that yields would go even lower. When the yields started to go up, Mr. Heise said, these investors may have been caught off balance. Their frantic efforts to backtrack may have accounted for the steepness of the rise.\u201cThe mainstream didn\u2019t expect oil prices to go up,\u201d Mr. Heise said. \u201cThis might have been the trigger.\u201dJ\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, the chief economist of Commerzbank, said that recent economic data, like the news last week that inflation in the eurozone had risen to zero from negative territory, was not enough by itself to explain the rise in yields.But it might have provided an excuse for traders to sell bunds. Market rates fell so low that German bonds \u2014 considered a refuge from financial turmoil \u2014 started to feel risky. The haven no longer seemed so safe.\u201cWhen everyone is aware yields are too low then small events may cause a correction,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.While the European Central Bank probably welcomes slightly higher German yields, the suddenness of the rise may be causing some uneasiness. \u201cThey don\u2019t like volatility,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said. \u201cVolatility is uncertainty, and uncertainty is bad if you want to stimulate the economy.\u201dMario Draghi, the central bank president, recently acknowledged being worried about unintended side effects from the quantitative easing program.\u201cWe are aware that very low interest rates for a very long time are a fertile terrain for financial stability imbalances,\u201d Mr. Draghi said last month, though he added, \u201cHaving said that, we don\u2019t see at this point in time evidence of systemically large financial stability imbalances.\u201dOne recent development is certainly unwelcome. As yields have risen, so has the value of the euro against the dollar. One reason central bank policy has worked so far is that oil prices have been exceptionally low, while ultralow interest rates in the eurozone have made it more attractive for investors to own dollars or other currencies offering a better return.Last month, the euro fell to about $1.05, its lowest since 2003. That made Italian fashion or Spanish wine cheaper in dollar terms, and has stimulated exports. But the euro was approaching $1.12 Monday, blunting the currency effect.\u201cQuantitative easing is effectively a euro depreciation program,\u201d said Mr. Kr\u00e4mer of Commerzbank. With market interest rates rising again, the program may no longer function as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Close Doors, Facing Low Returns and Investor Scrutiny", "Date": "2015-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the start of this year, however, the managers of three firms spun out of that gilded empire have called it quits after volatile performances and sometimes steep losses. They will return money to investors and focus on managing their own wealth.TigerShark, Tiger Consumer and JAT Capital Management are just three examples among a recent wave of hedge funds that have closed their doors to investors in the face of choppy markets. They are a reminder that the hedge fund industry is not all spectacular returns.In past years, titans like George Soros and Stanley F. Druckenmiller have also taken down their shingles, choosing to manage their own enormous wealth without the worry of pesky investors.These days, bothersome investors who make too many demands are just one item on a long list of frustrations. Privately, and sometimes publicly, managers complain that it has become harder to make money and that regulation has raised the cost of business.Add to that six long years of a bull stock market in the United States, and a coinciding six consecutive years of underperformance from the hedge fund industry. The average hedge fund returned 3 percent last year compared with a 13.7 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cIf you have enough money and on top of that it\u2019s a tough market and you don\u2019t want to deal with investors asking about performance, you can take the high road and say, \u2018Here\u2019s your money back,\u2019\u201d said Steven Nadel, a hedge fund lawyer at Seward & Kissel.Managers typically deliver the news in letters that emphasize soul-searching and express gratitude. John A. Thaler, the founder of the eight-year-old JAT Capital, told investors his decision \u201crequired a tremendous amount of self-reflection and intellectual honesty.\u201d Patrick McCormack, who built and managed Tiger Consumer for more than 15 years, called it \u201cone of the most difficult decisions I have faced.\u201dOthers are more direct. For Gideon King, of Loeb King Capital Management, running a hedge fund had just become \u201ctoo cumbersome.\u201d Mr. King, who has been managing money for 21 years, informed his investors in a letter in January that he would be closing the doors.All three have chosen instead to invest their vast personal wealth through so-called family offices, which means fewer regulatory hurdles and compliance costs. As a family office, each will not have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Regulatory changes, a result of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, have helped shine a light on the opaque hedge fund industry. But the new rules have also made it more bureaucratic. Hedge funds spend millions of dollars for compliance officers and hire teams of lawyers to deal with rules that require disclosures about their business.Mr. King highlighted this increase in paperwork in his letter to investors. \u201cAs the endless quest for becoming institutional continues on, the soul of investing might get lost, as the unmitigated compliance processes become cumbersome and interfere with the purity of speculative contemplation,\u201d he wrote. Mr. King declined to comment for this article.At the same time, disgruntled investors are making more noise. Some are fed up with paying high fees for little returns. Hedge funds typically follow a \u201c2 and 20\u201d model in which investors pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of returns.TigerShark, founded by Tom Facciola and Michael Sears, was one of the first hedge funds to be seeded by Mr. Robertson in 2001. During the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, it made investors money when the markets were down. But its fortunes turned more recently when it reported double-digit losses in 2011. When TigerShark told investors it would return their money in March, it had posted a 1.9 percent loss in the first month of the year. Mr. Facciola declined to comment.JAT Capital, which was seeded by Chris Shumway, a top deputy to Mr. Robertson, had volatile performance for several years. In 2013, it was ranked as one of the most successful hedge funds of the year, returning more than 30 percent for investors. But last year, it reported a loss of 11 percent after making bets on high-flying technology stocks that later came crashing down. JAT Capital fought its way back at the start of this year, reporting a gain of 4.4 percent in the first three months of 2015. Last week, the firm told investors it would close shop. Mr. Thaler declined to comment.Tiger Consumer lost 1.1 percent in 2014. Before the fund closed in March, it reported gains of 2.6 percent over the first three months of the year. Mr. McCormick, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Robertson, highlighted in his letter to investors that while his work was \u201crewarding,\u201d it was also \u201cdemanding work.\u201d He declined to comment.\u201cMost of the people that are closing down these days have underperformed recently and have seen investor assets leave, or can see the writing on the wall, and they just look at it and say, \u2018The added cost of having external investors is just not worth it anymore,\u2019\u201d said Simon Fludgate, a partner at the hedge fund advisory firm Aksia.In an industry that was once known for its swashbuckling style, it has become harder to stand out.Even as some investors withdraw their money from hedge funds, a greater number are pouring money in for the first time, bringing the industry\u2019s assets under management to nearly $3 trillion. That has made it hard for hedge funds to carve out a niche.This is the case in the world of activism, a hedge fund strategy in which investors buy a small stake in a company and pressure it to make changes.Activist campaigns have not only delivered outsize returns but have also attracted newcomers. So many hedge fund managers are turning into activists that companies often discover that more than one activist has a plan for how they can change.\u201cClearly, with the parade of announcements including this past week, it is definitely a trend,\u201d said Thomas R. Livergood, chief executive of the Family Wealth Alliance, a family office consultancy, referring to the announcement by JAT Capital last Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough ballgame to be in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Guiding Wealthy Retirees on Health Expenses", "Date": "2015-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetirement Special SectionDeath and disease don\u2019t discriminate, and that has many high-net-worth retirees worried. They realize fate could determine the quality of their retirement more than their lifetime of planning.\u201cThey have command and control over other aspects of their life, but this is the unknown,\u201d said Bill Hunter, director of retirement strategy for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s the who, what and when. Who will be afflicted? Will it be acute or chronic? Then the when: early in their retirement or in their later years?\u201dEnter big brokerage firms with services not typically associated with wealth management. Merrill Lynch, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are either offering to connect wealthy clients with providers that offer specialized health care, or training advisers to deal with such worries about health and aging among clients. They seem to be tapping a ripe market. According to research by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, a consulting firm on aging, high-net-worth retirees reported more concern over retirement health care costs than the general population. This group was also much more likely to have estimated or tried to estimate costs for health care and long-term care in retirement.While the research found that high-net-worth retirees are generally comfortable with the financial advice they have received, they are concerned about getting good advice on health issues, especially on finding the best doctors and understanding Medicare and supplemental insurance.A survey from PNC Financial Services in April found that 78 percent of people with more than $1 million in assets were concerned that health care costs would be expensive in retirement. And in a separate survey last year, a third of those people with more than $1 million worried that health costs would consume a major part of their assets. Two years ago, in the same PNC survey, fewer than a quarter of respondents expressed such concern.\u201cMy main concern is getting the right doctor at the right time,\u201d said Alden Leib, 77, a retired periodontist who splits his time between affluent towns, Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Palm Beach, Fla.A doctor friend \u201crecommended I take Celebrex for my sciatica and wrote me a script,\u201d Dr. Leib said. \u201cA week\u2019s supply was $650. I was amazed. I went online and found I could get a deal at Costco.\u201dThe PNC survey found that more than a third of millionaires were worried about drug costs. In the same survey, 75 percent were concerned about out-of-pocket costs and half about insurance premiums.Michael Narvid, a corporate lawyer in Sherman Oaks, Calif., who at 66 has started to contemplate retirement, says he believes he is in good health, but worries about expenses as health care and insurance undergo major changes.\u201cMy doctor\u2019s not charging up front, but I have to pay for his services and office time,\u201d Mr. Narvid said. \u201cHe was my father\u2019s doctor. He knows our family. I may switch, but there\u2019s a loyalty factor.\u201dSuch concerns \u2014 staying with a doctor who knows the patient well or finding a new one with the same level of knowledge \u2014 are driving big firms to offer perks.UBS has teamed with PinnacleCare, which helps people with medical decisions and can act as a liaison with doctors, as well as WorldClinic, which provides actual doctors and medical care to people wherever they are.Merrill Lynch has teamed with the University of Southern California\u2019s Davis School of Gerontology to create a program to help Merrill advisers better understand what their clients go through as they age.(On a more optimistic note, the firm also has a partnership with Virtuoso, a network of luxury travel advisers.)And Wells Fargo has a unit called life management services to handle all financial aspects of a person\u2019s health. The cost starts three-quarters of a percent on top of the asset management fee of 1.25 percent and goes down with assets.\u201cThis is for clients who want support in maintaining their independence,\u201d said Anne Tinyo, national manager of the program. \u201cWe act as the advocate. If someone wants to move to an assisted living facility, we\u2019ll call the moving company and arrange it, but we might be taking the client out to lunch while everything is happening behind the scenes.\u201dMorgan Stanley prefers to make referrals to services rather than get involved directly in the process. \u201cOur primary charge is it to help you manage your wealth,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Connor, managing director of retirement solutions at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \u201cA big concern is health care. But when you get more specific to address things, we outsource to a service that provides you with advice and advocacy. That\u2019s not our expertise.\u201dThat so many large firms are focused on something beyond stocks and bonds reflects the importance their clients place on health.\u201cThe single most important ingredient for a happy retirement is not money, but health,\u201d said Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave. \u201cIt soars off the page.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Divestment Campaigns", "Date": "2015-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueShould universities focus on \u201csustainable investments\u201d rather than divestment?In recent weeks, students at Harvard, Yale, Bowdoin and Swarthmore have staged sit-ins demanding that their schools divest from companies that mine fossil fuels. These students are right to be alarmed about the perilous state of our planet, but the widespread resistance by university administrators to these divestment campaigns and the lack of results call for a new approach.Rather than divestment, how about a \u201csustainable investment campaign\u201d on campuses, urging universities to put their money behind companies that are doing the right thing for our planet and its people?The combined endowments of North American colleges and universities are more than $450 billion. These endowments generate funds to support teaching, research and scholarships. But schools have erected rigid walls separating their academic values and mission and the instructions they give their investment teams. While some universities have established advisory committees to examine the impact of their investments on social and environmental issues, too often these efforts are purely reactive.Universities need to move from defensive \u2014 fending off divestment campaigns \u2014 to a more affirmative approach, exploring how to generate solid financial returns while rewarding long-term, sustainable business practices. To maximize their impact, those with the largest endowments should join together to develop common standards and metrics by which they will determine which companies merit their investments.Universities should also commit to applying the same environmental and human rights standards to their own procurement and operations. These schools spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on construction, the purchase of supplies and equipment, and service contracts. As intellectual and community leaders, they can model how to make environmental and human rights considerations an explicit part of their own business operations.The writer is co-director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at the New York University Stern School of Business.I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Posner that \u201cschools have erected rigid walls separating their academic values and mission and the instructions they give their investment teams.\u201d Universities are not any old investors. If they are not exemplars of moral sense, they defy their commitment to truth. For universities to legitimize fossil fuel corporations that obstruct truth (through their underwriting of public deception) and ward off sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels by lobbying for and exploiting public subsidies is counterproductive and indeed shameful.Investing in sustainables is an excellent idea, but hardly an alternative to divestment from fossil fuel companies. To the contrary. Divestment from fossil fuel companies, like divestment from tobacco and South Africa, helps stigmatize companies whose business models are incompatible with any sensible response to climate change. Divestment from fossil fuel companies is a vote of no confidence in appalling business practices that have, in fact, lowered the price of fossil fuels by subsidizing the costs and made sustainables much harder to develop and finance. Moreover, where universities go, pension funds will follow. Universities have a grand opportunity to lead where other institutions have thus far feared to tread.The writer is a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University and helped compose an open letter signed by more than 300 faculty members urging fossil fuel divestment.The writer is senior vice president for operations and public affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and gas producers. Universities should be focused on finding actual climate solutions. Divestment is not about finding a solution; rather, it is a national campaign by anti-fossil fuel activists to stigmatize an industry. The cost to students, however, would be significant, including millions of dollars lost in available scholarships and grants.I laud my fellow students here at N.Y.U. for their passionate desire to address climate change, despite our different approaches. I would certainly welcome the chance to work with them, as well as Mr. Posner, here at N.Y.U. to find a more productive approach. The sooner we can find a way to implement climate action in a financially friendly way, the sooner we can achieve real results.Mr. Posner\u2019s suggestion of a \u201csustainable investment campaign\u201d on campuses ignores the fact that virtually every campus climate campaign has promoted, and will continue to promote, campuswide energy efficiency and sustainable energy resourcing. Supporters of divestment know that we need to pursue these goals in addition to, not instead of, helping our communities understand why investments in the fossil fuel industry are no longer morally acceptable.The writer, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, is a core group organizer of Harvard Faculty for Divestment.Investing involves trade-offs. Attempting to influence companies\u2019 policies through threats to invest or divest, whether across broad categories of stocks, as divestment advocates propose, or in a more targeted fashion, as Mr. Posner suggests, means compromising one of the most valuable tools any investor has: the benefits of diversification.Having considered these costs, schools may decide that the value of the symbolic act of full or partial divestment justifies the cost. That\u2019s their right. But let\u2019s not delude ourselves on the fundamental point: There is a cost associated with these actions, and it is likely significant.The writer is a professor at the University of Chicago School of Law and chairman and president of Compass Lexecon, a consulting firm.American University\u2019s endowment is relatively small and thus its actions will do nothing to change the financial calculations of fossil-fuel companies or energy markets. Indeed, even if all of higher education shifted its institutional endowments, the financial value of energy holdings would change little. But that\u2019s not the point. Divestiture and green investment involve taking a stance so people come to see the production of fossil fuels as morally unacceptable.Climate change represents the most profound challenge humanity has ever collectively faced. Colleges and universities can play a role by deploying their reputations, through divestiture and positive green investment, in the service of building a post-carbon world.The writer is a professor of global environmental politics and co-chairman of the Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing at American University. Mr. Gitlin\u2019s letter makes clear that the university divestment movement aims to \u201cstigmatize\u201d energy companies, just as it once denounced South African apartheid. Champions of divestment have not focused enough on what actually motivates company performance in addressing the effects of climate change or advancing human rights. They should encourage universities to develop standards and metrics that enable them to identify companies making measurable progress in these areas.Mr. Shlyakhter worries that by making investment choices based on environmental or human rights criteria, universities will compromise their independence. Should they also stop taking corporate contributions or government grants? What about money from abroad? Universities have always balanced the need to raise operating funds while maintaining academic integrity. There is no logical reason to draw the line here, preventing universities from investing in companies because they promote a clean environment or human decency.Mr. Eshelman writes as a representative of the petroleum industry. He notes, probably accurately, that most investors aren\u2019t paying attention to the divestment movement. He does not acknowledge that if universities put their money behind companies pursuing alternative energy strategies, his industry will have to pay greater attention to the effects of climate change, a focus that is long overdue.I hope that this lively debate about how universities should square their values with their investments will lead to proactive steps in their investment offices.Advertisement"}

Because the house was worth a lot more than what he and his wife owed the bank on their mortgage, they are now sitting on a pile of money and wondering what to do with it.As we talked, the following became crystal clear:\u25a0They will buy another house in three to five years.\u25a0They don\u2019t know exactly where it will be.\u25a0This money has to be there when it comes time to buy.So when he asked me how they should invest this money, my advice was easy. I told him that he can take exactly zero risk with it, which means putting the money in something like certificates of deposit from a few different banks.He understood my reasoning on a theoretical level. But when I told my friend he was likely to earn just about nothing on that money, things got interesting.We work so hard to earn money. It almost kills us to think of our money not working for us. It feels morally wrong to let money just sit there doing nothing, like we\u2019re unwise stewards. This is exactly how my friend felt.But sometime, we need to let go of our focus on returns and shift our attention to safety. If we\u2019ve mentally assigned money to goals just a few short years away, knowing that money will be there is more important than finding an extra percentage point.Still, I understand the temptation to invest in the markets. What if stocks are poised to take off? What if we just heard some guru on a financial pornography network yelling, \u201cWe should all be buying the latest I.P.O!\u201d What if our neighbor tells us that emerging markets will double our return?To which I only have one reply: What if they\u2019re wrong?In a situation like this one, it\u2019s helpful to recall and repeat Mark Twain\u2019s advice to be more concerned with the return of our money than the return on our money. For things that are really important and less than five years away, like buying a house or taking a big trip, the return doesn\u2019t matter. All we care about is making sure the money is there when the time comes.So I\u2019m over the idea that a big pile of money has to generate a big return. We could invest that money, but we\u2019d also have to accept that three years from now, all the money might not be there. Any investment could come back later, but maybe not in time for the big, emotional goal we set. I\u2019m betting at that moment, we\u2019d feel even worse about less money or no money than no gain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Make of the Topsy-Turvy Bond Market", "Date": "2015-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrading TurmoilIf you happen to trade bonds for a living, it is entirely understandable if you are feeling a little anxious these days.Prices for United States Treasuries, German bunds and most other securities on the multitrillion dollar global bond market have been exceptionally volatile in the last couple of months. In this environment, someone who buys and sells them for a living could lose a fortune by taking an ill-timed bathroom break.But what happens in bonds matters for the rest of us, too. Bond prices translate into the price to borrow money for practically every family and business on earth, which, in turn, determines savings and investment patterns. In the latest bout of volatility, long-term interest rates in the United States have climbed by almost 0.4 percentage points. Since the interest rate is in an inverse relationship to a bond\u2019s price, the value of bond investors\u2019 portfolios has taken a hit.Bankers are warning that tighter regulations may preclude them from playing their traditional role of stepping in to buffer the ups and downs of markets. Regulators worry that asset managers are engaging in herd behavior that will fuel an unnecessary roller coaster in markets. And there is plenty of worry out there that years of central bank interventionism have dulled the proper functioning of markets.These arguments all have merit, and they aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. And when you look closely at what has been happening with bond prices, what it says about the economy is pretty much benign. What it says about how some of the markets at the core of the global financial system are working is far scarier.So first, what does the shift mean for the economy?Not so fast. Interest rates are still extraordinarily low by any historical standard and still below where they were in the fall of 2014. Viewed in a longer time horizon, it looks as if the bond boom of late 2014 and the start of 2015 went too far and is now partly reversing, not that some new trend of higher rates is taking hold.The factors that fueled those low rates to begin with \u2014 very low global inflation, vast pools of global savings looking for a place to be parked, central banks trying to use easy-money policies to restore growth \u2014 have changed after all.You don\u2019t have to believe there is an epochal shift going on, only modest changes in the last couple of months that can justify the move.It looks as if higher rates are coming. The Federal Reserve appears relatively committed to its plans to raise short-term interest rates sometime this year. Oil prices have risen after falling to recent lows over the winter, so inflation should be a bit higher than it had seemed in February. And the dollar has weakened on currency markets, which also signals higher inflation.Those all point to higher bond yields, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve gotten, with no major mystery.What is more of a mystery is why we\u2019ve seen such abrupt turns in a market that historically has been slow-moving and not prone to overreactions.Usually it\u2019s the stock market that is always rising and falling for reasons that are hard to explain (or justify). The bond market, dominated by sophisticated, grown-up institutions like pensions and sovereign wealth funds as opposed to individual investors, has traditionally seemed less prone to irrational jitters.In other words, there are perfectly plausible, fundamental reasons the 10-year Treasury yield should be 2.26 percent right now. But reasons it should have risen by half a percentage point since the start of February, with many jaw-dropping days in between? They are hard to fathom when nothing terribly dramatic about the economy or policy outlook has changed since then.And that\u2019s where we get to those explanations mentioned above involving the technical details of the bond market: things like banks being restricted from trading operations by new regulations, and asset managers crowding in and out of trades.We\u2019re in a world where the supply of bonds is relatively fixed. It has always been true that governments don\u2019t quickly adjust their deficit spending plans based on a move in rates. But in a normal state of affairs when prices rise, private bondholders are more willing to sell, helping restrain the size of swings.But now global central banks, having bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds in executing their quantitative easing programs, are not inclined to exploit price moves opportunistically. Rather, they are moving glacially, based on economic fundamentals, and with lots of advance communication on their intentions.Count other institutions that hold bonds as insurance against economic catastrophe \u2014 not because they are hoping for meaningful return \u2014 and the number of players in the market responding to prices in an economically rational way is small.This is a long way of explaining the common term of art in markets: There is less liquidity than there once was.One result is big swings based on small pieces of information, as the buffers that would normally sell into price increases and buy into price drops are nowhere to be found.And there\u2019s not much reason to think that the forces driving this \u2014 the expansive role of central banks in the market, the structures of banks and asset managers and so on \u2014 are going to change anytime soon.In other words, bond traders may just want to get used to postponing those perilous bathroom breaks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Math for Retirees and the 4% Withdrawal Rule", "Date": "2015-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringBeing relatively new to the profession, he dived back into his finance textbooks for answers, but said he couldn\u2019t find any guidelines rooted in facts. \u201cI decided to get down to business with my computer,\u201d said Mr. Bengen, 67, who retired in 2013 and now lives with his wife in La Quinta, a resort town in California\u2019s Coachella Valley.What he and his computer produced, in 1994, became part of the financial vernacular and is still the most widely referenced rule of thumb. Known as the 4 percent rule, it found that retirees who withdrew 4 percent of their initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjusted that dollar amount for inflation each year thereafter, would have created a paycheck that lasted for 30 years.The concept has been both celebrated and criticized, and it has recently come under scrutiny yet again, particularly as the current crop of retirees are entering retirement during a period of historically low interest rates. But the question of how much they can safely spend each year may be more important than ever: Roughly 11,000 people, on average, are expected to turn 65 every day for the next 15 years, according to the Social Security Administration.\u201cI always warned people that the 4 percent rule is not a law of nature like Newton\u2019s laws of motion,\u201d said Mr. Bengen, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor\u2019s in aeronautics and astronautics in 1969. \u201cIt is entirely possible that at some time in the future there could be a worse case.\u201dMr. Bengen\u2019s original analysis assumed the retirees\u2019 portfolio was evenly split between stocks and bonds, and he tested whether the paycheck could persevere through every 30-year period dating from 1926. It succeeded.The big question now \u2014 difficult even for an aerospace engineer to answer \u2014 is whether a new worst case is beginning to play out, given the painfully low interest rate environment, which yields little for safer bond investments, where retirees often hold a big portion of their money.Critics of the rule point out that it is based on conditions in the United States during a very specific time in history; it also doesn\u2019t take into account items like investments costs, taxes, different time horizons or the reality that most retirees don\u2019t spend their money in a linear fashion. Some people may want to spend more early in retirement and may be willing, even comfortable, making cuts when the market plunges once again. And if retirees want to leave money to their children, they may need to trim their spending further.In a recent analysis, Mr. Pfau compared several withdrawal strategies in an attempt to illustrate how spending patterns might change to guarantee that a portfolio will last for 30 years, even if low rates persist or retires face some other awful combination of events.He found that people who spend a constant amount adjusted for inflation \u2014 similar to the 4 percent rule \u2014 would have to reduce that rate to 2.85 to 3 percent if they wanted assurance that their spending would never have to dip below 1.5 percent of their initial portfolio (in inflation-adjusted terms).So a retiree with $1 million could securely spend nearly $30,000 annually for 30 years, in the best and worst of market conditions. The big drawback, though, is that if economic conditions are generally average, retirees would be left with $794,000 in unspent money. If they were unlucky and experienced terrible market conditions, they would be left with $17,900.That\u2019s the trouble with this strategy. \u201cMost of the time, you underspend,\u201d said Mr. Pfau, who is also a principal at McLean Asset Management. \u201cYet you still run the risk of running out.\u201dTo start that high, however, you need to follow a complicated set of rules: Normally, annual withdrawal amounts can increase by last year\u2019s rate of inflation. And in good years, retirees can generally increase withdrawals by 10 percent.But no increase is permitted in years when the portfolio loses money. In fact, a small spending cut might be necessary in that case: When balances drop below certain levels \u2014 causing your withdrawal rate to rise more than 20 percent above the initial rate, say to 6.4 percent from 5.3 percent \u2014 the next year\u2019s withdrawal must be cut by 10 percent.So perhaps it\u2019s not all that surprising that Mr. Bengen said he had hired not one, but two financial advisers \u2014 both good friends \u2014 to handle his retirement money. Though his advisers rely on financial software, he said they were proponents of the 4 percent rule.\u201cAnd my actual numbers probably come close to that,\u201d said Mr. Bengen, who spends his days honing his creative writing, playing the guitar, setting up bridge and boating clubs and taking time to visit his 20-month-old grandson. \u201cI have followed my own advice.\u201dBut if he had advice to offer others, it is this: \u201cGo to a qualified adviser and sit down and pay for that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are planning for a long period of time.

{"Headline": "Exploring Easier Ways to Save More and Cut Risk", "Date": "2015-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetirement Special SectionYour retirement portfolio may be bigger than you realize. At least it would be if all your resources \u2014 your salary and home and not just the 401(k) plan at work \u2014 were enlisted to accumulate enough wealth to satisfy your needs and wants in old age, some financial advisers say.Factoring other assets and income streams into a financial plan can provide greater ease and flexibility in meeting goals, these advisers say. Such an approach may be especially useful now because the low income that many assets pay is causing savers to make their portfolios work harder than they should when sensible adjustments, like spending less and contributing more, would accomplish the same objective.\u201cBy controlling spending today, it will mean needing less in retirement,\u201d said Ross Levin, president of Accredited Investors in Edina, Minn. Instead, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing clients trying to create an income stream from their portfolios by stretching for investments that have more risk.\u201dSaving more need not be an ordeal, Mr. Levin said. Cutting costs to save more and increase retirement contributions is one obvious tactic, but merely declining to loosen your belt, rather than tighten it, can have the desired impact.\u201cWhen raises come in, saving the additional portion of your salary and getting used to living on what you earn now allows you to put more away,\u201d he said.Even with no change in contributions, a holistic approach can help reduce portfolio risk and improve returns by showing where tweaks can be made to provide the best mix of holdings, according to a study by Morningstar Investment Management. It may help, for instance, to coordinate what you own with where you work, even if you don\u2019t own stock in your employer.Following the logic set out in the study, someone who works for a company whose share price is inclined to move independently of the broad stock market, for instance a utility, may do better with a higher allocation to stocks in his or her retirement portfolio; that employee would probably have more job security. By contrast, an employee at a company whose stock moves in closer alignment with the market, say in a technology field, may want to keep a lighter exposure to stocks. If the economy were to falter, so would the stock market, and that employee would be more likely to be out of a job. \u201cMost investors tend to focus entirely on the risk and return characteristics of investments, such as cash, bonds and stocks, when building portfolios, ignoring the interconnectedness of their portfolios with other assets they effectively own,\u201d the authors, David Blanchett and Philip Straehl, wrote. Edward Deicke, a financial adviser at JHS Capital Advisors in Plainview, N.Y., finds a few instances in which a retirement portfolio\u2019s holdings should be adjusted based on its owner\u2019s job, but only a few.\u201cTo some, the idea has merit \u2014 if you work for Apple, you certainly have a bet on the Nasdaq \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it affects that many people,\u201d he said.The ones who it might affect are older workers with large stock portfolios and jobs that would be hard to replace. They might want to reduce exposure to their industry. But while he generally discourages tinkering with industry allocations, Mr. Deicke advises clients not to buy stock in their employers.\u201cA lot of plans offer an ability to buy company stock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tell people never to do that because you\u2019re tying your human value to your 401(k). You already have an interest in the company.\u201d As people get older, their portfolios are gaining in value, knock on wood, and so are significant assets like their homes. A way to unlock that value is through a reverse mortgage; a lender makes monthly payments to a homeowner, rather than the other way around, and the money must be repaid when the home is sold or otherwise vacated. The payments to the owner are tax-free because they are proceeds from a loan, not a sale.But Walter Gondeck Jr., a partner in Deerfield, Ill., for HighTower, a nationwide financial advice firm, warned borrowers to avoid such mortgages where fees exceed 1 percent of the amount financed.A more straightforward way to wring cash out of a home that has substantial equity is to sell it in or near retirement and move into something smaller and cheaper. The money generated from the sale can produce income, and if your new home is in the right place, you can save in other ways. With no job tying you down, advisers say, you might consider a cheaper part of the country.Not that being tied to a job is necessarily a bad thing. Working part time into retirement means your portfolio won\u2019t have to work overtime, Mr. Levin said. \u201cOne of the things that people don\u2019t realize is that if they\u2019re making $10,000 a year in part-time work, it\u2019s like having an extra $250,000,\u201d he said, reasoning that $10,000 is the 4 percent that might otherwise need to be withdrawn annually from a $250,000 retirement account, following a financial planning rule of thumb. \u201cThere are things that people like to do for a little bit of money that can go a long way for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The piece, which had been estimated to sell for $12.8 million, featured round, perfectly matched green beads with a ruby and diamond clasp by Cartier, which made the winning bid. It is such prices that have been changing the jade market.\u201cWhen someone is spending millions of dollars purchasing a jadeite piece of jewelry, they are only concerned about the quality of the jade and not so much the design,\u201d said Eddy Hui, artistic director of Edward Chiu Jewellery Art, a boutique in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district that specializes in contemporary jade pieces. \u201cThey tend to stick with very traditional and simple styles because the value of the stone prohibits them from being too fashion-forward.\u201cBut we have been advocating other colors, which are more reasonably priced, and we can be more daring and creative, making jadeite jewels more relevant to the fashionable customer,\u201d he said.To illustrate, Mr. Hui held up two pairs of jadeite earrings of identical design, oval disks with a cut-out pattern. The white jade was listed at 110,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $14,193; the green was 250,000 dollars, more than double the price.In the Chiu shop, where merchandise is displayed in gilded birdcages, Mr. Hui also showed a flower bracelet, part of the company\u2019s \u201cLady Lavender\u201d collection. A combination of petals in lavender jade accented with black jade, ruby spinels and diamonds mounted in 18-karat white gold, it sells for 2.3 million dollars.Mr. Hui said he would not make such a daring design in green jade, as a top-quality stone in that color could be put to more profitable use. \u201cA jeweler will probably harvest the stone and make several pairs of earrings or pendants that will give a better yield,\u201d he said. Jade actually is a general term for two substances, nephrite and jadeite. Nephrite, which is durable and looks opaque (the Chinese call it \u201cmutton fat\u201d), has been used since prehistoric times to create objects from utensils to weapons. Jadeite, the more valuable stone, with a quartz-like or translucent appearance, is more commonly used for jewelry and was prized by Chinese emperors during the Qing dynasty (mid-1600s to 1912). Its growing popularity has even some Western jewelry designers, such as David Webb in New York and the Paris house JAR, featuring jade in their designs.Today, most jadeite comes from Myanmar. But \u201ctop-quality Burmese jadeite is becoming rare to find,\u201d another factor driving up prices, said Mr. Chiang of Christie\u2019s. Christie\u2019s Hong Kong, which has opened a sales department for clients who do not want to wait for its twice-yearly auctions, stocks jewelry in clear and lavender jade in addition to green. Mr. Chiang displayed one of its pieces, a ring with a cabochon-style piece of colorless jadeite. \u201cWhite jadeite has always been loved by the Chinese. They carve religious figures like the deity Guanyin with more opaque white because the color stands for purity,\u201d he said, referring to the Buddhist goddess of mercy. And \u201cfor more fashionable designs, a clear jadeite ring looks very contemporary.\u201dThe Chiu boutique also has pieces in yellow and red jade, which Mr. Hui said are favored by European customers. \u201cYellow complements the fair skin tone of Caucasian clients,\u201d he noted.While Chiu Jewellery Art focuses on dramatic, high-fashion styles, Kai-yin Lo, a self-taught designer in Hong Kong who began working with jade in the 1970s, has a more subtle aesthetic \u2014 although it also relies on various colors of jade. \u201cI have been using red, lavender, white and yellow jadeite in my design because classic green is too traditional,\u201d she said. Using a combination of nephrite sourced in China by antique dealers and jadeite from Hong Kong wholesalers, Ms. Lo connects jade pieces with silk cords, sometimes adding small whimsical details such as a coral ring or a horn fastener to an otherwise elegant assemblage.The design of jade jewelry also is influenced by the shape, texture and characteristic of the stone. Mr. Hui noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not like diamond jewelry where you can create a design and source various shapes and sizes of diamonds. Jadeite is always the origin of the design itself.\u201d A nephew of Mr. Chiu, who died two years ago, Mr. Hui comes from a family of jadeite specialists who travel to Myanmar regularly to obtain stones. \u201cBecause we are experts, we already have our idea of what we want to make and what the quality of the jadeite before we even harvest it from the boulder,\u201d he said.And sometimes a designer has to be patient. Michelle Ong, the owner and designer of the Hong Kong jewelry brand Carnet, said it took her several years to collect jade in the right size and shape for a floral-design brooch and a necklace of diamonds and gourd-shaped yellow jadeite. \u201cJadeite is always going to be the chosen gemstone for Asians because of our heritage,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the fact that we need to take our time and find the right stone first \u2014 you can\u2019t rush it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scoping Out a Phantom Recession", "Date": "2015-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesYet on a public policy question that is central to their field, economists have often been dead wrong. Economists, as a group, have been so bad at forecasting the ups and downs of the business cycle that it\u2019s a wonder they continue trying to forecast at all.Presumably, if we\u2019d had some early warning, it might have been possible to take action to forestall the disaster \u2014 or at least prepare for it. Governments, corporations, families, universities, pension funds \u2014 just about everybody was blindsided. That\u2019s the nasty side of forecasting failure. There is a lighter side, too. Economists often discern phantom recessions \u2014 downturns that never materialize in the real world. One of those hovered in the ether until last month, the recession of 2011 and 2012. Happily, it never happened, and we were all spared a great deal of pain. Unfortunately for the institute, if not for everyone else, it was clearly a false alarm. \u201cMea culpa,\u201d Mr. Achuthan said in an interview last week. \u201cWe got that one wrong, and we regret it.\u201d Why did the institute need nearly four years to own up to the error? It\u2019s taken that long to sift through the data, Mr. Achuthan said. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, a part of the Commerce Department, periodically revises the statistics on gross domestic product for up to five years, and until recently, Mr. Achuthan said, the institute wasn\u2019t certain about the state of the economy in 2011 and 2012. It seemed possible, he said, that revised numbers would show that he was right. They haven\u2019t, though. Instead, he has come around to the consensus view, which isn\u2019t much more cheerful. The economic cycle shuddered and growth slowed but didn\u2019t turn down enough to have registered as a recession. (He used the phrase \u201cpronounced, pervasive and persistent\u201d to describe the institute\u2019s recession criteria.)No one is cheering about the economy. Even without a second recession, the recovery from the last one that did take place has been the weakest since the Great Depression. That\u2019s even after extraordinary efforts by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy \u2014 and while the Fed has stopped adding to its bond portfolio, it has yet to begin raising short-term interest rates, which remain near zero percent. Fed policy continues, in short, to be highly stimulative.Despite all that help from monetary policy, for the most part the economy has grown in fits and starts at a very subdued level, and that anemic progress continues: The most current government figures show that the seasonally adjusted G.D.P. grew a mere 0.2 percent, annualized, in the first quarter of this year. The number for the second quarter is expected to be somewhat better, but even so, this has not been an economy to celebrate. \u201cIt\u2019s been about as weak as it could be without falling into recession,\u201d Mr. Achuthan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a recession on the horizon right now. But growth has been so low that there isn\u2019t much leeway.\u201dThe Federal Reserve and other central banks have certainly contributed to the sharp rise in the value of assets like stocks and real estate since the nadir of 2009, he said, and they have probably also contributed, indirectly, to global economic growth. But it\u2019s quite possible, he said, that we have not fallen into another recession yet mainly because we\u2019ve been \u201clucky.\u201d There has been no negative oil price shock, for example, unlike in past periods when such shocks precipitated recessions.Professors Stock and Watson were skeptical. \u201cBecause most of the reduction seems to be due to good luck in the form of smaller economic disturbances, we are left with the unsettling conclusion that the quiescence of the past 15 years could well be a hiatus before a return to more turbulent economic times,\u201d they wrote. That could be true now, too, Mr. Achuthan said. He isn\u2019t predicting another recession. But he is still forecasting economic weakness, and his track record is still unblemished on that score.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Main Street Portfolios Are Investing in Unicorns", "Date": "2015-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookBut don\u2019t worry, the thinking goes. Main Street investors won\u2019t get hurt as they did after the dot-com collapse of 2000 because the current crop of highfliers are privately held by expert investors like venture capitalists. So most civilians will be fine should things turn south this time.Here\u2019s an open secret: That\u2019s fiction.The good news is that investors across a broad range are able to invest in these pseudo-private companies, democratizing, to some degree, the investment process. The bad news is that should the bubble pop, these investors have already bought shares in the companies at sky-high valuations. And these people may not even realize it.Perhaps troubling \u2014 or at least questionable \u2014 is how mutual funds like T. Rowe Price, Fidelity and BlackRock value these investments in unicorns. Venture capitalists invest in companies in search of breakout hits. These rarities, called unicorns, have grown in size and number as investors chasing returns have bid up their value.Usually, their funds invest in public companies or publicly traded bonds. It is easy to determine how much the fund\u2019s holdings in a publicly traded company are worth: The stock has an exact price.Private company valuations, however, are quite different. There is no meaningful stock market for these shares. Their values are based on what a small handful of investors \u2014 usually venture capital firms, private equity firms or other corporations \u2014 are willing to pay for a stake. Such investors come with a different risk appetite and motivations than, say, the average worker looking to save for retirement. Sometimes, the investor that helps set the new valuation is another company, like Baidu or Xiaomi, the Chinese Internet and electronic companies, both of which invested in Uber. Their interest in Uber may be strategic, making the exact valuation less important. Maybe Baidu, for example, one day hopes to form a partnership with Uber, so that Uber drivers deliver packages for Baidu? Who knows?It\u2019s virtually impossible to know exactly how the mutual funds determine the value of private companies. Not one of the mutual fund companies with which I spoke was willing to fully explain its methodology. T. Rowe Price offered this statement: \u201cValuations are the responsibility of a cross-disciplinary valuation committee, which operates independent of portfolio management.\u201d The company added: \u201cThe factors we consider include significant transactions in these securities, new rounds of financing, the company\u2019s financial and operational performance, strategic events impacting the company and relevant valuations of similar companies.\u201dFidelity was equally noncommittal. \u201cWe have a rigorous and thorough fair-market valuation process for mutual fund holdings,\u201d the company said. BlackRock declined to comment.Many mutual fund companies do not even disclose their stakes in private companies. For example, many firms disclose only the top 10 investments in their funds. Fidelity shows the value of its holding in a particular company \u2014 for example, it says its Contrafund has a stake in Uber worth $162 million \u2014 but doesn\u2019t say how many shares it owns or how it arrived at that number. Many mutual funds allow for up to 10 percent of a fund to be invested in what are called illiquid investments. While it\u2019s tough to discern how a mutual fund has valued an asset, it\u2019s often even harder to understand the terms of the deal. In some cases, people involved in these transactions say, special deals are struck for preferred shares that include downside protection; some of the deals include deadlines for the companies to go public and penalties if they don\u2019t. And some mutual funds have sold their private shares even before the start-up has gone public, people involved in the transactions say.Some mutual fund managers suggest they like investing in private companies because they get a better peek under the hood than a public company offers.\u00a0Another of the reasons that mutual fund companies say they need to buy into start-ups is the dearth of I.P.O. opportunities and the increasingly extended period that start-ups stay private. That\u2019s true. But the mutual funds are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by making such investments, which provide disincentives to private companies to go public more quickly. It is worth noting that these stakes in private companies usually represent a tiny fraction of a total mutual fund\u2019s portfolio. The Fidelity Contrafund says the $162 million stake in Uber is only 0.145 percent of its entire fund. So if you\u2019re an investor looking for a lot of exposure to unicorn technology companies, these mutual funds are hardly going to give you a concentrated bet. And that\u2019s probably a good thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Computer Sciences to Split Into 2 Publicly Traded Companies", "Date": "2015-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Computer Sciences Corporation is the latest member of corporate America to break up as a way to raise its stock price.The company said on Tuesday that it planned to divide its commercial business from its government contractor unit; each will become a publicly traded company. The split is expected to be completed by the end of October.The commercial business, which reported $8.1 billion in revenue in its 2015 fiscal year, will focus on servicing private sector clients. The other new publicly traded concern will be a consultant to federal and state government agencies, which reported $4.1 billion in sales in the 2015 fiscal year.In splitting itself, the information technology services provider will join a long line of companies that have turned to such corporate divorces as a way to improve returns for shareholders.

And no one, including the company\u2019s executives and regulators, can say exactly why. \u201cThe board confirms that it is not aware of any reasons for these price and trading volume movements, or of any information which must be announced to avoid a false market in the company\u2019s securities,\u201d the company, Goldin Properties, said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.Unexplained price swings are not unheard-of in Hong Kong\u2019s volatile stock market. But the sheer scale of the whipsaw trading in recent days is drawing attention to the investing risks. Shares of Goldin Properties, which lost 40 percent last Thursday, were up 43 percent on Tuesday. Shares of a related company, Goldin Financial \u2014 which, like Goldin Properties, is controlled by the billionaire Pan Sutong \u2014 plunged more than 40 percent last Thursday. And a day before that, shares in the Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, a solar equipment manufacturer controlled by the Chinese billionaire Li Hejun, fell 47 percent before trading in the stock was suspended. All three companies have offered no explanation. Regulators, too, have been quiet.The situation underscores the sometimes opaque nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. Some companies like Goldin often have only a small number of shares trading on the open market, making them especially susceptible to large swings.Information for such tightly controlled companies can also be sparse. Companies are not subject to the same disclosure requirements as they are in other major markets, including the United States.

{"Headline": "The \u2018King of Cable\u2019 Behind a Charter-Time Warner Cable Deal", "Date": "2015-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, as Mr. Malone tries to pull off the biggest land grab of his career, he is once again avoiding the limelight. Yet there is little doubt that Mr. Malone is behind the scenes, orchestrating an upheaval of the industry he helped create two decades ago. \u201cHe\u2019s the genius behind the curtain,\u201d said Jason Bazinet, a media analyst with Citigroup. \u201cHe hands it off to lieutenants to run the businesses.\u201dMr. Malone shaped the cable television industry in the 1980s and \u201990s, selling TCI \u2014 which he built into the country\u2019s largest cable operator \u2014 to AT&T for $48 billion in 1999. (That is about $68 billion in 2015 dollars.)He walked away from the business that made him a fortune and went on to control a disparate collection of media companies, including the satellite radio provider Sirius XM, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, the QVC home shopping channel and big telecommunications companies in Europe. Though seemingly unrelated, the companies Mr. Malone has preferred share some qualities: They tend to have stable, recurring revenues. They are capital intensive, making it hard for new entrants to pose a challenge. And they have allowed him to engage in famous bouts of financial engineering, taking on leverage, spinning off subsidiaries and creating tracking stocks, much to the delight of enriched shareholders. Then, two years ago, Mr. Malone invested in Charter, taking a minority position and a seat on its board. And though Mr. Malone does not officially control Charter, he is widely understood to be guiding the company\u2019s aggressive acquisition strategy. \u201cWhen he talks, I listen. And he is a significant talker,\u201d Charter\u2019s chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cI know what he thinks, and he knows what I think.\u201dIn Charter, Mr. Malone sees the same qualities that have attracted him to companies in the past. Though cable television is challenged by consumers\u2019 shifting media habits, Charter and Time Warner Cable are big providers of high-speed Internet service, a lucrative and growing business. And in its enlarged state, Charter will be able to wield influence. \u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous confidence of his vision of where this industry should go,\u201d said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cAnd he is incredibly determined and creative in pursuing that vision.\u201dCharter\u2019s new position of prominence would also mean that Mr. Malone, who was once known as the \u201cking of cable,\u201d could be close to reclaiming that title.\u201cHe is the power behind the throne,\u201d said Mark Robichaux, author of \u201cCable Cowboy: John Malone and the Rise of the Modern Cable Business.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a huge need to have his ego stroked. He doesn\u2019t revel being up on stage in the spotlight.\u201dThis approach has allowed him to help shape an unusually wide swath of the media business. \u201cHe has no peer,\u201d Mr. Bazinet said. It has also afforded him the time and the budget to pursue his appetite for land. It was Mr. Turner who gave Mr. Malone the land bug. In the early 1990s, Mr. Turner had recently acquired the Flying D Ranch in Montana and took Mr. Malone on a helicopter tour of the pristine landscape.Yet Mr. Malone\u2019s true passion has always been the United States cable industry, even as he had to watch new empires being built after he cashed out with the sale of TCI to AT&T. \u201cHe regretted getting out of the U.S. cable industry,\u201d Mr. Robichaux said. \u201cHe sat on the sidelines and watched AT&T squander everything he bequeathed them. Then he saw what Comcast created.\u201dAnd even as he turned Liberty Global into the biggest cable operator in Europe, observers thought it was only a matter of time until he returned to the United States market.\u201cHe has a core set of beliefs about where the world is going,\u201d Mr. Bazinet said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s very patient. He waits for the stars to align.\u201dHis first opening came in 2013, when a meaningful stake in Charter was available for purchase. But Charter\u2019s initial pursuit of Time Warner Cable was foiled last year when Comcast swooped in with a higher offer. When the Comcast deal was blocked by regulators, however, Mr. Malone pounced. In recent weeks, he and Mr. Rutledge approached Time Warner Cable, offering an easy path and a generous price. Charter\u2019s transformation is no done deal. The sale must still be approved by the same regulators who thwarted Comcast\u2019s attempt at a nearly identical deal. And at times, Mr. Malone has had a contentious relationship with regulators in Washington. \u201cMalone is like an alligator,\u201d Mr. Robichaux said. \u201cHe is perfectly content to wait for the right opportunity for a long time, then will pounce with a ferocity that knows no bounds.\u201dEmily Steel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bond Turmoil Signals a New Era of \u2018Return-Free Risk\u2019", "Date": "2015-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsUnited States and German government bonds are gyrating as they rarely do. Yields are shooting higher for no apparent reason, and sometimes falling back within hours for equally unclear motives. Such turbulence in the biggest and most liquid bond markets is ushering in a new era. The traditional concept of risk-free returns has been turned on its head.Ten-year Bund yields have multiplied by 16 times, to a high of 0.80 percent on May 7 from 0.05 percent on April 17. And German bond prices, which move inversely to yields, have suffered a larger drop than in 99 percent of the three-week periods of the last 25 years, UBS Wealth Management strategists calculate. Comparable United States yields, meanwhile, have risen by more than a quarter in less than four weeks, peaking at 2.37 percent.The brutal moves are creating what Jan Straatman, global chief investment officer at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, calls \u201creturn-free risk.\u201d Investors have two problems as a result.The first is sharply practical. Safety has become expensive, or less safe. Holding cash in the form of a rock-solid currency, such as the Swiss franc, is punitive, because policy interest rates are close to zero, or even negative. Gold is supposed to be a solid store of value, but the price is in thrall to the dollar\u2019s volatile exchange rate. And now United States and German government bonds are looking risky.These days, the hunt for safety is not a big theme for most investors. They would rather take some risks in return for higher yields. But that brings up the second problem with the new era. High turbulence in supposedly safe bond markets complicates the pricing of risk.The standard asset pricing model relies on a benchmark risk-free interest rate. Riskier investments \u2013 like corporate bonds through shares and artworks \u2013 are supposed to promise a probable additional return in exchange for additional uncertainty and price volatility. The model is like a compass pointing in the direction of the right price. But this compass goes haywire when safe debt becomes extraordinarily volatile. Investors are left at sea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Holds Rates Steady", "Date": "2015-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Conservatives, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, made fiscal tightening a key tenet of their campaign, and many economists predicted that the party\u2019s victory meant the Bank of England would further delay any rate increase. As the government cuts spending, the idea is that the Bank of England mitigates the impact of those cuts with low interest rates to encourage borrowing and other economic activity.The JPMorgan economist Allan Monks trimmed his forecast for Britain\u2019s 2016 growth rate to 2.3 percent, from 2.6 percent, based on the impact of expected budget cuts. The Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the overall deficit, now running around 5 percent of gross domestic product, by 2019.Samuel Tombs, senior economist for Britain at Capital Economics in London, wrote last week in a client note, \u201cThe economy remains on track for a major reintensification of the fiscal squeeze next year.\u201dBut the picture is more complicated than that, other economists said.British economic growth slowed to 0.3 percent in the first quarter, half the rate of the final quarter of 2014. Manufacturing and construction figures have been soft. Mr. Cameron has promised to call a referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, adding to the economic uncertainty. And wages, which the central bank predicted would grow 3.5 percent in 2015, are expanding at a much slower pace. All of those factors suggest that rates will stay low for longer.But driving the case for a move toward \u201cnormalization,\u201d or higher interest rates, are rising oil prices and the eurozone, which is in better shape than it was in February, when the central bank issued its latest inflation report. Additionally, the uncertainty that surrounded the election \u2014 and predictions that it would result in a hung Parliament \u2014 has been removed.\u201cThe market hasn\u2019t had much stability in terms of where it\u2019s predicting the next hike,\u201d said David Tinsley, chief economist for Britain at UBS. One moment the market expects rates to rise next summer, and another it expects them to rise next spring. \u201cUnless there is a firmer story on wage growth,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will continue to be the story.\u201dThe Conservatives swept to victory last week in spite of near-unanimous opinion polls indicating the election would be neck and neck. The Liberal Democrats, who had been in a governing coalition with the Conservatives, lost seats, as did the more left-leaning Labour Party. The Scottish National Party made significant gains, presenting a challenge for Mr. Cameron, who will have to figure out how much power to cede to Scotland.Against that new landscape, the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted on Friday to keep rates steady. (The announcement of the decision was postponed until Monday to avoid conflicts with the election.)On Wednesday, the central bank is set to release its latest economic predictions in a new report on inflation. Inflation in Britain has been zero percent for the past two months, the result of falling oil prices and lower food prices. The central bank seeks to hit a 2 percent inflation target and when it falls short, Mark J. Carney, the central bank\u2019s governor, is required to write a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why the target has not been met.While Britain\u2019s economy grew at a healthy 2.6 percent clip last year, wages have remained largely stagnant, suffering from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. The issue was a critical one in the election as Labour sought to capitalize on anemic wage growth to make its case that only a small portion of Britain was feeling the benefits of the recovery. The Conservatives took credit for the strong economic figures and argued that they needed more time to bring the fruits of the recovery to more people.After the election, stocks rose in London and the pound moved higher. On Monday, the FTSE 100 stock index had risen about 0.17 percent around midday in London, while the pound held steady.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Social Media Punished as Results Fall Short", "Date": "2015-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA trio of social media stocks is getting pummeled this week, a sign that Wall Street may be unwilling to overlook missteps at some of its Internet darlings.LinkedIn on Thursday plunged as much as 25 percent in after-hours trading after the professional social networking company forecast second-quarter sales that were weaker than Wall Street estimates.The performances illustrate the way investors are questioning whether social media companies can keep their growth rates vigorous enough to justify their valuations. The stocks of all three companies had traded at relatively high levels, reflecting Wall Street\u2019s giddy projections. Yet all three shattered that perception in their own way. And while many of these stocks are often volatile, with investors on edge about the weak economy, interest rates and other issues, shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep.\u201cBased on where some of these stocks were trading, expectations were already very high and were priced for relative perfection,\u201d said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. \u201cThe reaction when companies don\u2019t achieve great results can be fairly severe.\u201dWall Street analysts are already reassessing their financial forecasts of some of the social media companies. In the last few days, several analysts who track Yelp and Twitter have lowered their expectations of the financial and stock performance of the companies.\u201cWith some of the larger platform companies like Facebook and Google, valuation isn\u2019t based so much on stretched growth targets,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said.Unlike many other social media companies, LinkedIn doesn\u2019t depend on online advertising for its performance. On Thursday, the company posted a 35 percent jump in sales for the first quarter, exceeding estimates, with growth from services it sells to recruiters and premium subscriptions.Some of these \u201cinvestments required operational transitions that will be impacting our results through the middle of this year, but that we anticipate will position us well for 2016 and beyond,\u201d said Jeffrey Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, in a conference call, where he pointed particularly to the sales force and spending on research and development.Yelp, which collects user reviews about restaurants and other local services, reported late Wednesday that its ad sales and user growth decelerated during the first quarter.

{"Headline": "Bankers and Regulators Voice Fears on Bond Market Volatility", "Date": "2015-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street chieftains, huge investment firms and top bank regulators are all sounding the same alarm.In recent months, they have been warning that the world\u2019s bond markets, where companies and countries borrow trillions of dollars, are in danger of breaking down.Their fear is that in an event like a surprise increase in interest rates, trading could rapidly dry up, causing violent movements in bond prices and even disrupting the functioning of the market. According to this view, the destabilizing volatility in the bond market could make it harder and more expensive for companies and countries to borrow.But is the bond market really as fragile as the doomsayers say? Bond prices have plummeted in the past, but recovered if the wider economy was in reasonable health. Why wouldn\u2019t that happen again?Bankers and asset managers, after all, might be tempted to overstate their concerns, with an eye on their bottom lines. Yet the caution is also coming from prominent regulators, like Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and the units at the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury Department that are tasked with scouring the globe for financial threats.A preview of what could happen, the bankers and regulators say, took place one morning in October. Then, in a matter of minutes, the yield on a benchmark Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, mysteriously plunged. The market soon recovered, but the speed and size of the move left Wall Street stunned. Regulators have yet to provide a conclusive explanation of what occurred.Those voicing such fears say that recent changes in the bond market could change the way that Wall Street banks, large bond funds and trading systems would behave in a period of turbulence. Other developments have left the market vulnerable, they say. A huge rally in bond prices over the last several years, stoked by vast amounts of monetary stimulus by central banks, may have made the market vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.Also, more bonds are now concentrated in the hands of a few large fund management companies, whose combined selling could tip bond prices into a tailspin. And then there is the role of electronic trading, which has spread in certain bond markets and is thought to have played in the disruption in the Treasury market in October.\u201cThey make more of this as a way of discrediting regulation,\u201d he added.Indeed, the bond market has functioned remarkably well since the chaos of the financial crisis of 2008. In the United States, it has consistently provided a huge amount of credit to a vast range of companies, even when banks pulled back after the crisis.Retail investors have also profited from the bond market, notching up spectacular returns on their bond funds in recent years. And on some measures, trading conditions continue to be robust. For instance, the difference between the price at which Wall Street dealers offer to buy bonds and the price at which they offer to sell them is quite narrow. This suggests that investors are having little trouble transacting at reliable prices.Of course, the bond market, like any major securities market, could sell off steeply in the future, causing trading to dry up for a while. And if borrowers in the market are not defaulting en masse, investors are likely to rush back in.But things could be worse in a future decline, according those who are concerned. One reason they give is that a greater proportion of bonds are held at large bond funds that may find it harder to sell their positions in a falling market. In the logjam, prices may plunge further than they might in earlier crises.Still, that situation assumes in part that investors in the funds will stampede for the exits \u2014 and on the whole they did not in the last crisis.The pessimists also highlight the role of banking regulations introduced after the crisis. Many of the new rules, some of them acknowledge, have made the bond market sturdier. Wall Street dealers, for instance, use much less borrowed money to finance their trading, which reduces the likelihood that they would dump those bonds during market turbulence.Even so, the new rules, the worriers contend, have eaten away at the bond market in other ways. The regulations, they assert, have caused Wall Street dealers to slash the stockpiles of bonds that they make available to investors. As a result, they assert, the dealers will be less willing to act as \u201cshock absorbers\u201d in future market turbulence and buy bonds from fleeing investors.It is not clear that the dealers ever acted in this way, however. If anything, there is evidence for the opposite.Trading dried up for a time during the shakeouts in the market in 1994, 1998 and 2008, all of which occurred when there were far fewer restrictions on Wall Street dealers. In 1994, for instance, when interest rates unexpectedly rose, bond dealers slashed their holdings of bonds by nearly a third, according to figures from the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe dealers are profit motivated, so they are not going to catch a falling knife,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports rules that rein in risk taking on Wall Street.Echoing their past behavior, the dealers reduced their inventories in the so-called taper tantrum, a sell-off that took place in 2013 after investors concluded that the Fed might \u201ctaper\u201d its monetary stimulus earlier than they had thought. Analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded later that regulatory constraints \u2014 like higher capital requirements \u2014 were most likely not the cause. Banks that had spare capital to take on more bonds chose not to use it, and withdrew. As a result, the Fed\u2019s researchers said, the dealers most likely pulled back as part of a marketwide shift in which bond investors became more cautious about the outlook for bond prices.Hung Q. Tran, of the Institute of International Finance, a group that represents banks, is not convinced by the New York Fed\u2019s findings, however. The thrust of the new regulations is to prevent dealers from extending themselves by taking on more assets, he said. As a result, Mr. Tran contended, it is to be expected that banks decide against taking on more bonds even if they have the spare capital to do so.Yet some analysts who have raised concerns about bond inventories at banks said that they did not want to give the impression that Wall Street had stepped into the gap during past bond market swoons.\u201cThis is not to claim that banks have typically or regularly acted as shock absorbers in the past,\u201d Gaston Gelos, the division chief of the global financial stability analysis at the International Monetary Fund, said in an email.

He had been studying investing for years and had been a member of several investment clubs since the late 1980s.\u201cThat gave me confidence I could make money on the money I had,\u201d Mr. Kavula said.There are good reasons for retirees to manage their own financial lives: Saving money on fees is one benefit, and more closely aligning investments with personal goals is another.But there is dangerous ground along the way: Taxes, estate planning, rules around gifting to relatives, timing of withdrawals from retirement accounts and other issues can be immensely complex and are getting more so.For those who are reluctant to go it entirely alone, a growing alternative for retirees is the model of do-it-yourself investing done through so-called robo-advisers. After you enter your risk tolerance and other information in an online form, a software program automatically creates a portfolio of low-cost exchange-traded funds. It\u2019s a way to avoid paying commissions or being tempted by brokers pushing you into investments you do not quite understand.Betterment, Personal Capital and Wealthfront started the robo-adviser model. Not to be outdone, more traditional firms have entered the arena. The discount broker Charles Schwab, for example, introduced its Intelligent Portfolios robo-adviser in March.Yet the new generation of automated portfolio managers may not be suitable for retirees who have complex financial needs.One of the biggest concerns that human advisers have when it comes to their algorithmic alternatives is how investors will use them during market downturns. Skittish retirees may make some costly timing decisions by selling at the wrong time.\u201cThese programs are still in their infancy, said Tom Balcom, of 1650 Wealth Management in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla. \u201cWill investors sell out and change portfolio allocations when they\u2019re scared?\u201dFew, if any, robo-advisers provide this service, and it is a difficult question for investors, although some automated options do provide tax-loss harvesting services to lower tax bills.But financial transactions with large tax implications often need the guidance of someone with extensive experience in financial planning, especially for investors with multiple retirement accounts.But advisers might create more problems than they solve, in addition to costing more than the solo strategy. Roy Chastain, 69, who had retired from his job as a lawyer for the state of California, originally chose to work with a large brokerage adviser, but called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have a large portfolio, and they offered me products and limited advice,\u201d recalled Mr. Chastain, who lives in Sacramento. \u201cThey were more salesmen than analysts.\u201dLike Mr. Kavula, he now manages his own portfolio of individual stocks, mutual and exchange-traded funds. He has been a member of an investment club since 1994.A solution could be to combine do-it-yourself management with human help, by using an adviser to set up a portfolio that you would then monitor and control. This approach, using a mix of E.T.F.s and mutual funds, can save money in fees, but the price goes up if you give in to likely efforts from advisers to push you toward more active management.\u201cBrokers have an incentive to go to active management to add value,\u201d said Chris Chen, a fee-only adviser with Insight Financial Strategists in Waltham, Mass.That often translates into higher fees and expensive mistakes. Mr. Chen said that when one of his clients was with another broker, \u201che paid 2.7 percent in fees, which included advisory and mutual fund expenses,\u201d he said. This compares \u201cto about 1 percent to 1.2 percent annually for an E.T.F. portfolio that includes advisory fees and E.T.F. costs. A lot of decisions go into constructing a portfolio. There are so many moving parts.\u201dYet another option is a model that combines the call-in services of a financial adviser with the ability to use online tools. Such a hybrid model was recently announced by the Vanguard Group, the large mutual fund company.Still, there\u2019s nothing wrong with managing your own low-cost portfolio, as long as you understand the risk involved and can find help for any additional financial concerns. Before setting out on your own, it is wise to ask \u2014 and answer \u2014 several questions to determine what you\u2019ll need to complement your financial skill set.\u201cWhat\u2019s the complexity of your needs?\u201d asked Robert Stammers, director of investor education for the CFA Institute, a group that represents investment professionals. \u201cWhat\u2019s the cost of making a potential mistake?\u201dFor example, what if you need to integrate an investment strategy with a tax and estate plan? You will probably need to work with an estate planning lawyer and financial adviser to ensure that everything aligns with your intentions.You will also need to be honest about your ability to confidently stick to your investment policy, which is a written plan on how much risk you want to take in all market conditions. Will you sell when the market goes south or buy more stocks?But advisers say a little bit of hand-holding can go a long way, as can joining forces with other investors.For his part, Mr. Kavula, who speaks across the United States to help educate investors, has joined clubs affiliated with BetterInvesting.His advice? \u201cDon\u2019t try to hit a home run and don\u2019t be greedy. Be patient on your way to investing. People heading in and out of the market won\u2019t be successful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Companies including Apple, Samsung and Microsoft have introduced straps and other gadgets aimed at collecting and analyzing ever-increasing types of data, including users\u2019 steps and their sleeping patterns.Fitbit, and the privately held Jawbone, are among the veteran figures in the wearables industry.\u201cOver eight years ago, in early 2007, we started Fitbit with the vision that sensors, data and amazing software could transform the way people think about health and fitness,\u201d the company\u2019s founders, James Park and Eric N. Friedman, wrote in a letter to prospective investors.Last year, the company earned $131.8 million, swinging from a nearly $52 million loss in the previous year. Its sales more than tripled during that same time, to $745.4 million.Consumer electronics companies have often been met with strong investor demand when they have gone public over the last few years. The sports video camera maker GoPro, for instance, priced its I.P.O. at the top of its expected range; its market value then soared. As of Thursday, that company\u2019s stock remained nearly double its debut price.Yet the emergence of broader-use wearable devices like the Apple Watch are expected to eclipse simpler fitness-oriented devices, according to Juniper Research. Fitbit acknowledged the growing competition in its prospectus, specifically mentioning Apple\u2019s device as a potential threat.According to Thursday\u2019s filing, insiders currently own more than half of Fitbit\u2019s stock; Mr. Park and Mr. Friedman together control about 21 percent. The largest outside shareholder is Foundry Group Funds, which owns 28.9 percent, while True Ventures owns about 22.4 percent.The prospectus does not list how much stock shareholders plan to sell.Like many market debutantes these days, Fitbit plans to have two classes of stock. Class B shares will have 10 times the voting power of the Class A shares that will be sold in the offering. That means that insiders will effectively maintain control of the company for the foreseeable future.Fitbit plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FIT. Its offering is being led by Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Stocks Belong in a Retirement Portfolio", "Date": "2015-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetirement Special SectionFor years, the trope in retirement planning was to reduce the stock holdings in your portfolio and add bonds as you neared or entered retirement. That advice is being challenged.It goes against the grain to suggest that a successful retirement portfolio might need more stocks. Doesn\u2019t that mean more market risk? It does, but weighed against inflation and bond-market risk, it could mean the difference in having enough money in one\u2019s 80s or 90s or older.The key to this relatively new thinking is that stocks can deliver better inflation-adjusted returns than bonds most of the time and they may offer sustainable retirement financing over several decades. If you know how much risk you can take, you need to keep this growth-oriented \u201cglide path\u201d in mind to cover your future needs.According to Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., who wrote a recent paper with Michael Kitces of the Pinnacle Advisory Group, a private wealth management firm in Columbia, Md., a \u201crising glide path\u201d that leans toward a greater percentage of stocks in a retirement portfolio \u201cis often the best shot at making your money last.\u201dMr. Pfau and Mr. Kitces ran simulations using various mixes of stocks and bonds over time. Since stock valuations go up and down every year, in some years they may be a better buy than in others. \u201cWith U.S. historical data,\u201d the authors report in their paper, \u201cit is difficult to beat a strategy which maintains a consistently high allocation to stocks to the extent that a retiree\u2019s risk tolerance allows for this, and subject to the caveat that high stock allocations cannot always be expected to do as well in the future.\u201dIn other words, if you understand the risk trade-off \u2014 and can stomach the year-to-year volatility \u2014 keeping or adding stocks in your portfolio may make sense.While bolstering the stock mix in your retirement portfolio looks good on paper, Mr. Pfau admits \u201cit\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d Many are skittish about taking on more risk when they are trying to preserve capital. And it would really blister your retirement kitty if we had another 2008. In moving to a more dynamic form of investing, you also run the risk of timing the market. Managers can \u2014 and do \u2014 often guess wrong on the best times to buy. And most investors tend to buy stocks on the upswing and not when they are bargains.It\u2019s worth asking how much you will need in your nest egg to maintain a certain standard of living. What will your cash flow needs be, given out-of-pocket medical expenses, long-term care and discretionary expenses?At the very least, your adviser should be able to run some simulations based on the amount of money you have, your projected retirement withdrawals, how much you will spend and various portfolio mixes and rates of return. Of course, that\u2019s a lot for anyone to digest. Fortunately, most planners have software that can generate multiple \u201cwhat if\u201d situations. They can show you the benefits of adding or scaling back on stocks. In any case, if you are chary about stock investing, you need to understand how diversifying with stocks and a variety of other assets can improve returns over time.Craig Israelsen, a developer of 7Twelveportfolio.com and principal with Target Date Analytics, has found that a \u201cmoderately aggressive\u201d portfolio employing 12 different types of investments not only can outperform an all-stock portfolio, but beats all-cash and traditional \u201c60 percent/40 percent\u201d stock-bond portfolios.In a study of different portfolios covering 1998 through 2014, Mr. Israelsen\u2019s 12-asset mix returned an annualized 7.6 percent, compared with 6.4 percent for all stocks and 6.5 percent for the 60/40 combination. A certified financial planner, chartered financial analyst, registered investment adviser or qualified retirement planner should be able to give you a \u201cpresent value\u201d calculation. This figure shows the value today of an amount of money in the future given a certain rate of return.The way this math works is that the higher the rate of return on your portfolio \u2014 which also elevates market risk \u2014 the less money you\u2019ll need today to fund your retirement. That\u2019s where stocks come in, which historically have had higher annual returns than bonds or cash.No matter how you size up your retirement financing needs, one thing is certain: You\u2019ll need to open your mind to different possibilities on how various investments perform over time. \u201cTo me,\u201d Mr. Israelsen notes, \u201cthere are two major financial issues pertaining to retirement planning: adequate savings rate and an adequately diversified portfolio. It\u2019s kind of like medicine. What is needed by one 59-year-old may not be appropriate for another 59-year-old.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Top 25 Hedge Fund Managers, a Difficult 2014 Still Paid Well", "Date": "2015-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor investors in hedge funds, like big pension funds, 2014 was not a lucrative year. But for those who managed their money, the pay was spectacular.That collective payday came even as hedge funds, once high-octane money makers, returned on average low-single digits. In comparison, the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index posted a gain of 13.68 percent last year when reinvested dividends were included.Still, the men (no woman has ever made the cut) at the top of the hedge fund universe now run firms that are bigger than they have ever been. Their influence is growing beyond the industry and even beyond Wall Street. They lobby in Washington, donate to political campaigns nationwide, and can pick their advisers from a pool of former central bankers.Topping the list is Kenneth C. Griffin, who started by trading convertible bonds out of his dormitory at Harvard. He took home $1.3 billion last year. James H. Simons, a former National Security Agency code breaker who makes billions of dollars every year from his hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, earned $1.2 billion. And Raymond Dalio, who runs the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, with more than $170 billion in assets under management, reaped $1.1 billion.In close fourth was William A. Ackman, who is known for making large and concentrated bets, and for being outspoken about them. Mr. Ackman earned $950 million in 2014.The pay estimates are based on the value of each manager\u2019s stake in his firm and the fees charged. Investors in hedge funds generally pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of the total assets under management and 20 percent of any profits.For the average person, these sums are extraordinary. But the overall pay for top earners was down by hundreds of millions of dollars in 2014. These managers made just over half of the $21.15 billion earned by the top 25 in 2013.The men at the top of the hedge fund universe now run firms that are bigger than they have ever been.Still, what makes such nine- and 10-figure paychecks remarkable for 2014 is that many of the top earners had mediocre performances at best. Only half of the top 10 earners recorded returns that exceeded that of the S.&.P 500.For investors, 2014 was the sixth consecutive year that hedge funds have fallen short of stock market performance, returning only 3 percent on average, according to a composite index of 2,200 portfolios collected by HFR, a firm that tracks the industry. Hedge funds are lightly regulated private pools of capital open to institutional investors like pension funds, university endowments and wealthy investors.Such large investors continue to shovel money into the $2.9 trillion hedge fund industry, desperate to make returns in an environment of near-zero interest rates. So far this year, $18.2 billion of new capital has flowed in.In terms of performance, Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital and Mr. Griffin\u2019s Citadel were standouts. Pershing Square\u2019s two funds gained 36 percent and 40 percent, the best returns in the 2014 ranking. Citadel posted returns of 18 percent to investors in its flagship Kensington and Wellington funds. Both Mr. Ackman and Mr. Griffin declined to comment for this article.At Renaissance, the best-performing equities fund was up 14.5 percent, and its institutional futures fund gained 7.4 percent. Mr. Simons\u2019s wealth, however, is tied up in the firm\u2019s secretive Medallion fund, which manages only employees\u2019 money and has earned average annual returns of more than 30 percent over two decades.Elsewhere, returns were more modest.Mr. Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater started the year strong, with well-placed bets on interest rates in Europe and the United States, but momentum slowed in the second half of the year. He made 3.6 percent and 8.7 percent in his two main Pure Alpha funds. Mr. Dalio\u2019s spokesman declined to comment.Some notable managers were missing from the Alpha list entirely. The billionaire financier John A. Paulson did not make the cut because his Paulson & Company hedge fund lost money in 2014. Mr. Paulson, an inveterate art collector whose office is lined with Alexander Calder watercolors, was the second-highest earner in 2013, reaping $2.3 billion. He declined to comment.And some of the most prominent names on past Alpha lists are no longer counted, having converted their hedge funds into family offices, managing chiefly their own money. Among them are George Soros, Steven A. Cohen, Carl C. Icahn and Stanley Druckenmiller.Computer scientists whose firms use quantitative strategies were among the top earners last year. Mr. Simons employs astronomers and physicists and uses computer programs to scan reams of data in search of patterns to make investments, for example.David E. Shaw, whose $36 billion D. E. Shaw firm hires data scientists to build algorithms for trading, made $530 million in 2014. Mr. Shaw, who has a computer science Ph.D. from Stanford, is no longer involved with the daily management of D. E. Shaw\u2019s investments. A spokesman for D. E. Shaw declined to comment.In a year when managers complained about unnavigable markets, with the leading central banks keeping interest rates low, hedge funds that employed a variety of strategies fared better.Israel A. Englander took home $900 million after his firm, Millennium, made returns of 12 percent in 2014. Based in New York, Millennium uses a platform model to invest with 170 individual managers who each use their own trading strategies. Mr. Englander does not charge a management fee. Instead, investors share the costs of running the firm.Mr. Simons, who stepped down from day-to-day management of his $25 billion firm, Renaissance, in 2010, has been a significant political supporter of the Democrats, donating $8.3 million in 2014 alone. A spokesman for Mr. Simons declined to comment.Activist investors, once the scourge of corporate America because of their strategy of buying up large stakes in companies and then throwing their weight around with management, came out on top, too.Larry Robbins, an activist investor who prefers to be called a \u201csuggestivist,\u201d made $570 million in 2014. He made a fortune for himself and his investors in 2013 after winning a proxy contest against Health Management Associates. Mr. Robbins has also made a windfall betting on health care stocks like Humana, Thermo Fischer Scientific, HCA Holdings and VCA. A spokesman declined to comment.One group of hedge fund managers known as the Tiger Cubs also made the top of list. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Julian H. Robertson, they are named after his firm, Tiger Management.One of them was O. Andreas Halvorsen, the founder of Viking Global Investors, who earned $450 million last year. A former Norwegian Navy SEAL, Mr. Halvorsen is fiercely competitive; he came in eighth for his division several years ago in an Ironman race that included swimming, running and cycling.Chase Coleman made $425 million last year. His firm, Tiger Global Management, reported steady returns for investors. The Tiger Global fund reported gains of 16.9 percent and Tiger Global Long Opportunities of 15.5 percent. The firm also makes venture capital investments in start-ups. A spokeswoman for Mr. Coleman declined to comment.An article on Tuesday about top earners in the hedge fund industry misstated the amount of new money that has flowed into hedge funds so far this year. It is $18.2 billion \u2014 not $95 billion, which is how much hedge fund assets have grown so far this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hong Kong and Mainland China to Partly Open Markets for Investment Funds", "Date": "2015-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLegal/RegulatoryThe initial quota for the so-called mutual recognition of funds program will be capped at a relatively modest 300 billion renminbi, or around $50 billion, for flows in each direction. But it marks a significant development, giving international asset managers their most direct access yet to mainland investors.The mutual recognition initiative \u201cis a major breakthrough in the opening up of the mainland\u2019s funds market to offshore funds,\u201d Carlson Tong, the chairman of the Hong Kong securities regulator, said Friday in a news release. \u201cIt will also open up a new frontier for the mainland and Hong Kong asset management industries, and make available a wider selection of fund products to investors in both markets.\u201dHong Kong and Beijing have talked for years about opening their respective markets for investment funds, but the program was put on the back burner in favor of a link between the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets, which kicked off in November. It has since helped fuel a strong rally in shares on both sides of the border.Mainland China has a massive pool of domestic savings, most of it sitting in bank accounts. The domestic fund industry is young but growing fast. The mainland had more than 2,000 registered funds of all types as of May, with total net assets of about 5.7 trillion renminbi, according to figures from Wind Info, a financial data provider.Hong Kong has long been a popular market for the sale and distribution of fund products to investors. The mutual recognition of funds program aims to encourage foreign asset managers to go a step further by setting up funds based in the city, expanding the local finance industry and creating new white-collar jobs.In the initial stage, the regulators said Friday, the linkage will only apply to general equity and bond funds, as well as to certain exchange-traded funds that track benchmark stock indexes by purchasing the underlying shares.That appears to exclude other types of investments, like money market funds, which have recently grown popular in the mainland. They are heavily marketed by Internet companies, including Alibaba\u2019s financial-services affiliate, Ant Financial.Funds seeking to participate in the program will first need regulatory approval, with the Beijing and Hong Kong agencies saying they would work toward standard rules.Under the rules released on Friday, mainland funds aimed at Hong Kong must have been established for one year and have a minimum size of 200 million renminbi, or its equivalent in a different currency. The people running the funds can only sell a maximum of 50 percent of the fund\u2019s shares or units by value in Hong Kong.The Beijing and Hong Kong securities regulators said that in the coming months they would conduct briefing sessions to explain the details of the program. In their statement, they said they agreed on the July start date \u201cto ensure that mainland and Hong Kong market participants have sufficient time to prepare; to understand the differences in laws and regulations, business requirements and operations of the two markets; and to prudently assess and manage the risks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Investment Lifeboat Drill Now Can Help Weather Future Disaster", "Date": "2015-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyCalm water makes a lifeboat drill much easier. We aren\u2019t fighting the waves or the fear we feel during an emergency. Still, if the worst happens, and the drill becomes reality, at least we\u2019ve rehearsed. We\u2019ll know exactly what we are supposed do.With the markets relatively calm, now is the perfect time for an investor lifeboat drill. But to get the most out of this drill we need to remember how we felt seven years ago when the markets were getting scary.Remember the days when even smart, reputable people shouted gloom and doom from the rooftops? If not (or if you\u2019ve blocked it out), let me give you the abridged version: It was terrifying.The United States government was bailing out private companies that were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d We were reading shocking headlines on a regular basis:With those memories and emotions in mind, let\u2019s start the first drill.Take out a blank piece of paper. Grab two Sharpies, one red, one black. Write $250,000 in black in the upper left corner. Then, write $225,000 in the lower right corner. Use the red Sharpie to draw a down arrow from left to right to represent a market drop of 10 percent. How do you feel?For the second drill, pull out another piece of paper. Write $250,000 in the left corner and $200,000 in the right corner. Draw a scarier red arrow because now we\u2019re talking about a loss of 20 percent.Things are more serious at 20 percent. After all, market declines of 20 percent or more qualify as bear markets. But you\u2019re still O.K. You\u2019ll grit your teeth and continue to buy more stock at regular intervals because you believe Warren Buffett, who says you should be greedy when others are fearful.The third drill will prove the most challenging. We\u2019re going to focus on the \u201cor more\u201d part of the last drill. Think back to the market highs in 2007 and the market lows in 2009. The broad stock market index dropped over 50 percent. Write down those numbers on a third piece of paper. That\u2019s $250,000 and $125,000. What will you do?We know what many people did last time. They jumped overboard instead of getting into the lifeboat. History shows us the markets recovered. However, right at that moment, they just wanted the pain to stop, so they sold all their stocks.I understand that this lifeboat drill seems academic, maybe even a little silly. Why do we need to think about what the markets might do? Sure, they\u2019re not really doing anything right now. But that could change at any time.To be clear, I\u2019m not predicting a correction or stating that we\u2019re in the midst of a bubble. I don\u2019t appear on television often enough to predict something like that. Since 1945, however, we\u2019ve averaged one correction every couple of years. We haven\u2019t had a correction of 10 percent or more in roughly 43 months.Even if we plan to buy through the next dip, no matter how big or small, we\u2019re fools if we miss the opportunity to practice how we\u2019ll react.

{"Headline": "Fees on Mutual Funds Fall. Thank Yourself. ", "Date": "2015-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWall Street is reaping mounting revenue from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, yet investors are paying lower fees. That sounds like a good deal for the millions of people who use the funds to invest their savings, and a great deal for the companies that run and sell the funds. But that win-win situation is not quite as benign as it would seem. Many investors are still \u2014 often unwittingly \u2014 paying huge fees that cut into retirement savings.\u201cIt\u2019s not mainly thanks to the efforts of the fund companies,\u201d Michael Rawson, an author of the Morningstar study, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly because people have gravitated toward lower-cost funds.\u201d Yet because of the peculiar economics of the asset management industry, fund companies are still doing great. The companies that run the funds have been reaping outsize rewards because as fund assets have grown \u2014 thanks in part to the market\u2019s terrific performance over the last six years \u2014 the companies\u2019 own costs have declined. That\u2019s because of economies of scale that the companies don\u2019t share fully with customers. \u201cThe cost of individual funds has dropped, but the assets have gotten so much bigger that the companies\u2019 revenue from fees has grown tremendously,\u201d Mr. Rawson said. \u201cThey could be sharing more of those revenues with consumers, but they\u2019re not.\u201d Using publicly available documents, the Morningstar researchers estimated that in 2014, fee revenue from all stock and bond mutual funds and E.T.F.s reached a record high of $88 billion, up from $50 billion a decade earlier. Assets under management grew 143 percent, and industry fee revenue surged more than 75 percent. The asset-weighted expense ratio \u2014 the funds\u2019 publicly declared expenses divided by the actual money that investors put into them \u2014 declined, too, but only by 27 percent. \u201cThe industry \u2014 rather than fund shareholders \u2014 has benefited most,\u201d the report said. Mr. Rawson, a Morningstar analyst, wrote the report with Ben Johnson, director of global E.T.F. research at the company.The details are fresh, but the economic machine that propels the asset management business has been whirring along for decades. In a telephone interview last week, John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, the industry\u2019s low-cost leader, said that in some ways, running a fund company is like operating a factory. As you ramp up production, it becomes cheaper to produce additional items because important costs \u2014 fixed costs \u2014 don\u2019t rise.For an asset management company, he said, a stock or bond portfolio is the core product and the intellectual exercise of selecting stocks and bonds for it is a fixed cost. \u201cWhen you set up and run the portfolio, it\u2019s not much more expensive to do it when your fund has, say, $1 billion in assets, than when it had only $30 million,\u201d Mr. Bogle said.\u201cUnless you cut your fees drastically, you\u2019re going to generate a lot more money for your company as assets grow,\u201d Mr. Bogle said. \u201cBut do you think the industry wants you to understand that? Absolutely not. Most fund companies aren\u2019t passing those savings on to investors.\u201d Vanguard, which is owned by shareholders of its funds, passes along most of the savings. Morningstar found that Vanguard\u2019s average asset-weighted expense ratio in 2014 was 0.14 percent, lower than any of the other top asset management companies and lower than 0.64, the current asset-weighted expense ratio for all funds. Mr. Bogle says companies should charge a modest, flat fee for setting up a portfolio \u2014 not a percentage of assets, charged annually, which is the current practice \u2014 and give fund investors the rest of the money. That would not generate the splendid profits that asset management companies and their owners have enjoyed, however. No wonder that in a rising market, shares of publicly traded asset management companies tend to outperform their own stock portfolios. For example, since the beginning of March 2009, the start of the current bull market, through April, the stock of BlackRock, the giant E.T.F. company, returned 27.1 percent, annualized, compared with 20.8 percent annualized in the iShares Core S&P 500 E.T.F., a BlackRock fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to Bloomberg. You would have been better off investing in BlackRock, the company, than in its own S.&.P. 500 index fund.Why should mutual fund and E.T.F. investors care about the economics of fund expenses? Because it\u2019s the dark side of compounding, a force that can be magical when it works in your favor.I did some calculations on the damage that fund expenses might do to a retirement account over a lifetime. Assume you invest $10,000 and earn 7 percent a year over 50 years. With no expenses at all, your nest egg would grow to roughly $294,570. That\u2019s the magic part of compounding. But then consider the effects of expenses: If they are only 0.14 percent a year, the Vanguard average, you\u2019d still have about $275,904 and lose $18,666 in expenses. At an expense ratio of 0.64 percent, you\u2019d end up with only $218,231 and lose $76,339 in expenses. And at 1.19 percent annually in expenses \u2014 which is the ratio for the industry including many funds that people rarely buy, a.k.a. the equal-weighted expense ratio \u2014 you\u2019d have just $168,398 in your retirement stash: You would have lost about $126,173 to expenses.That\u2019s why investors need to stay on their toes. Until they get much more help from the rules and regulations, vigilant consumers themselves will be the main force holding down fees and protecting their own nest eggs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Jonathan Steinberg Made Good on a Second Chance", "Date": "2015-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom his earliest days as a 20-something chief executive, Jonathan L. Steinberg had a weekly lunch with his father, Saul, the corporate raider whose brazen tactics and lavish displays of wealth came to define Wall Street in the 1980s.Have the courage of your convictions and be sure that you can shoulder pain, the late Mr. Steinberg, whose own financial decline attracted wide scrutiny, would tell his son.It was good counsel, because the younger Steinberg would come to know pain too, not least in 2001 when his business media enterprise imploded just as his father\u2019s insurance conglomerate went bust.But because he stuck to his guns, the tiny stock indexing division that Mr. Steinberg pulled from the ruins of his old firm \u2014 now called WisdomTree Investments \u2014 has become one of the fastest-growing fund companies around.In the first quarter of this year, WisdomTree, which oversees $60 billion, took in more cash than any other asset management company save for the fund giants Vanguard and BlackRock.There are second acts on Wall Street, but they are by no means the norm, not least in an industry where memories are long and the damage from the loss of money and reputation can last forever.Which is what makes Mr. Steinberg\u2019s rebirth \u2014 nascent as it may be \u2014 worth noting, for he is shouldering the burden of not just his own history but his father\u2019s as well.In that regard, it should have been a triumphant moment for Mr. Steinberg when he presented the best results the company has had to analysts at his quarterly earnings call this month.Yes, it was a great quarter, they agreed. But wasn\u2019t the company relying too much on a few hot funds?\u201cWe are not going to change our business model,\u201d Mr. Steinberg replied, his voice taking on a slight edge.It is a radical concept that Mr. Steinberg, known as Jono, believes will change the way people invest by combining the best aspects of active and index funds.Let\u2019s say you wanted to invest in Europe\u2019s recovery, for example. Instead of worrying whether the mutual fund you pick will deliver as advertised, you could invest in a WisdomTree E.T.F. that tracks the Continent\u2019s top exporters \u2014 at a fraction of the cost.When you add a currency hedge to the mix, the results are arresting.The $13.5 billion that WisdomTree attracted in the last quarter surpassed the amounts that two traditional mutual fund groups, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, brought in combined.Still, when it comes to a Steinberg promoting his company, Wall Street has tended to be skeptical. In 1968, when the elder Mr. Steinberg, then just 29 years old, used the highflying stock of his computer leasing company to take over Reliance, an established insurance company in Philadelphia, there were doubters.Their numbers increased over the years after his attempt to take over Chemical Bank failed and Reliance floundered in debt. Mr. Steinberg suffered a serious stroke in 1995 and became less involved in the business. He died in 2012.There was, however, another aspect to the man: a restless ambition that pushed hard against the conventional practices of the day \u2014 Mr. Steinberg was an early user of junk bonds, for example \u2014 that has taken root in his son.\u201cI think Jono has a lot of Saul\u2019s good qualities and many better qualities on top of that,\u201d said Arthur Levitt Jr., the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a former board member at WisdomTree who also knew Mr. Steinberg\u2019s father from his early investment banking days. \u201cHe is indomitable in terms of his determination and his unwillingness to accept no for an answer.\u201dThere are other similarities.Growing up in Brooklyn, the father obsessed about the stock market. His son did the same \u2014 albeit while growing up in a 34-room triplex at 740 Park Avenue.For a time, they were even outshone by their glamorous wives. Gayfryd Steinberg, Saul\u2019s third wife, engineered some of the splashier fetes of that era; Maria Bartiromo, who married Jono in 1999, would become the public face of financial television.Mr. Steinberg also boasts a similarly full head of hair.In some ways though, he is a different man altogether. There is none of the outsize charisma and appetite that distinguished his father. And over the years, Mr. Steinberg has been a rare presence at the society benefits and balls that the elder Mr. Steinberg favored.To some extent, this reflects his rockier path to success. His father breezed through the Wharton School and had become a Wall Street boy wonder by the age of 30, but Mr. Steinberg struggled with a reading difficulty and left Wharton after his junior year.And the trials and tribulations of the stock-picking publication he set up in 1988 \u2014 backed in large part by his father \u2014 drew the close attention of the business press, up until he had to sell it in 2001.So it is no surprise then that Mr. Steinberg, who is 50, treats an interview as if it were an earnings call with analysts. Carefully controlled, his answers are laden with data points and financial jargon and he reveals little or nothing about his personal life.Maybe that is because his professional and personal lives can blur together \u2014 dating back to the age of 13 when he invested his bar mitzvah money in the stock market. He and Ms. Bartiromo are workaholics and, as they have no children, outside distractions are fewer.\u201cI always saw myself running a publicly traded financial services company,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the product of my father \u2014 doing exactly what I expected to be doing.\u201dA few days before the first-quarter earnings report, Mr. Steinberg had one of his regular lunches \u2014 at the Four Seasons in Manhattan \u2014 with Michael H. Steinhardt, the retired hedge fund pioneer who took a big stake in WisdomTree in 2004 and remains its chairman and largest shareholder.Over a career of home run investments, Mr. Steinhardt\u2019s WisdomTree bet has been his most profitable, and with the stock just off its high, the two men could not help but wallow a bit in the moment.\u201cJono has gone from zero to $60 billion in less than 10 years,\u201d said the 74-year-old Mr. Steinhardt. \u201cThat is almost too good.\u201dThere was a time though, Mr. Steinberg noted, when it seemed entirely possible that his dream of transforming his failed media company into an E.T.F. powerhouse would remain just that.At the time, E.T.F.s were an emerging investment concept; moreover, Mr. Steinberg\u2019s plan to create his own indexes based on different investment themes represented the furthest frontier of E.T.F. innovation, now known in the mutual fund industry as smart beta.Money was short, investors (some wary of the Steinberg name) were not returning his calls and his stock was trading at 3 cents \u2014 as opposed to $20 today.On an impulse, Mr. Steinberg reached across the table and gave Mr. Steinhardt a man hug.\u201cIt was frigging hard,\u201d he said with a big grin. \u201cBut I was able to persuade this one.\u201dAfter a few years of slow, steady growth, WisdomTree began to cash in on the post-2008 boom in asset prices, especially with its export-oriented funds in Europe and Japan.These two E.T.F.s alone, which were hedged against a weak yen and euro, have taken in an eye-popping $35 billion in the last two years.All of a sudden, WisdomTree and its 100 or so employees had become the fifth-largest E.T.F. sponsor, prompting envy among their competitors.For example, in BlackRock\u2019s San Francisco office, where the company\u2019s booming E.T.F. unit is based, executives, many of them industry pioneers, have been scooping up WisdomTree stock for their personal investment accounts.As well they should, says Mr. Steinberg. After all, he has spent the last 15 years of his life explaining why investing in focused E.T.F.s is a better deal for the investor.Now, when the analysts and industry experts come to him with their doubts, this is what he says:Wake up!Mr. Steinberg bellowed the words, startling a reporter and two public relations staff members in a conference room at WisdomTree\u2019s offices.For such a disciplined man, it was a surprising moment of catharsis. A statement, perhaps, that after all these years, this Steinberg has nothing left to prove.An earlier version of this article misstated the low point of WisdomTree\u2019s stock price. It was 3 cents, not 0.03 cents.An earlier version of a picture caption in this article misstated the type of business WisdomTree Investments is. It is an exchange-traded fund, not a mutual fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Madoff\u2019s Essential Man", "Date": "2015-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne morning years ago, an auditor from the firm KPMG paid a visit to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities\u2019 offices at 885 Third Avenue, the sleek, tubular Midtown office tower known as the Lipstick Building. The auditor informed Frank DiPascali Jr., Madoff\u2019s de facto chief financial officer, that he was conducting due diligence for a major European bank and asked to see a trade ledger \u2014 a roster of Madoff\u2019s transaction records \u2014 for the investment fund.The trade ledger should have backed up what Madoff told his investors he was doing with their money: periodically buying and selling large volumes of blue-chip stocks and, in the intervals between those trades, parking the cash safely in government securities. What Madoff was actually doing, of course, was using some investors\u2019 money to pay \u201cprofits\u201d to other investors, which is the classic Ponzi-scheme model, executed at a scale no one had dreamed of before. As no trading was being done, no trade ledger existed. And if DiPascali couldn\u2019t produce one for the auditor, the whole scheme would be exposed.DiPascali, who died of lung cancer late last week at 58, told this story in a Manhattan courtroom in December 2013, during the trial of five of his former colleagues in Madoff\u2019s firm. By then, he had testified over the course of four years against his former mentor and others at his firm. His testimony contributed to more than a dozen guilty pleas and convictions that followed the Ponzi scheme\u2019s spectacular collapse in 2008, a collapse that erased almost $65 billion on paper from investor accounts overnight.If DiPascali had an unusually intimate knowledge of Madoff\u2019s deceptions, it was because he had been an architect of many of them. By the final years of his life, DiPascali had become the Madoff affair\u2019s necessary man twice over. Madoff could not have succeeded without him. Neither could the federal prosecutors who sent Madoff and his accomplices to prison.Like Madoff \u2014 at once a legitimate Wall Street innovator who helped computerize the Nasdaq market and an outsized villain who ruined thousands of families \u2014 DiPascali reflected both the light and the darkness of the American success story. He was raised in a working-class neighborhood in Queens and graduated from Archbishop Molloy High School with no trade or office skills to his name. He did, however, have a neighbor, Annette Bongiorno, who worked for Madoff, who at the time was running a small wholesale securities firm specializing in trading over-the-counter stocks for institutional customers. She helped DiPascali land a job at the firm.In 1975, just before his 19th birthday, DiPascali arrived at Madoff\u2019s cramped offices at 110 Wall Street, an eager-to-please kid with a small frame, darkly intense eyes, a chain-smoking cigarette habit and a rough Humphrey Bogart glamour that he never quite lost, even years later when his life lay in shambles. At first, he was barely useful. By his own account, he did odd research chores for Madoff\u2019s brother Peter and other traders at the small firm. He tried a little trading himself, but didn\u2019t have a knack for it.It was only several years later that DiPascali found his niche. In the 1970s, automation began to gain a toehold on Wall Street, with systems-technology companies promoting the potential of computers to liberate firms like Madoff\u2019s from the crushing burden of manual paperwork that had stalled the evolution of trading in the late 1960s. DiPascali took an interest in the new machines, and by the mid-1980s, his self-taught computer skills became his ticket into Madoff\u2019s inner circle.In 1987, when Madoff decided to move uptown to the Lipstick Building, DiPascali was put in charge of overseeing the relocation. At 30, he found himself wielding Madoff\u2019s money and power with contractors, computer technicians and the building\u2019s managers; his pride in the success of that venture was still evident, decades later, when he testified about it in court.Ever since he started working at the firm, DiPascali had been aware that Madoff, in addition to running a successful wholesale stock-trading business whose clients included the largest firms on Wall Street, was also managing money for some wealthy private clients. In the early years, these dealings were probably legitimate. But at least by the late 1980s, the steady, comfortable profits that clients preened over at country-club dinners and charity golf outings were no longer the product of Madoff\u2019s investment acumen. They were simply the fresh cash collected from new investors.When exactly DiPascali learned this \u2014 that is, when he shed his role as Madoff\u2019s eager gofer and became his willing co-conspirator \u2014 is unclear. Madoff insists it wasn\u2019t until the early 1990s. DiPascali told the judge in 2009 that it might have been in \u201cthe late \u201980\u2019s.\u201d Prosecutors have argued in court that it was much earlier. But what is clear is that DiPascali\u2019s signal contribution to the fraud\u2019s success came in 1992 and early 1993.Until then, most of Madoff\u2019s clients invested through a few \u201cfeeder funds\u201d: large private funds that pooled cash from many small investors. That meant that Madoff\u2019s own bookkeeping requirements were limited to providing monthly statements for the dozen or so accounts set up by those funds. But in 1992, federal regulators discovered that one of the largest funds feeding money to Madoff was unlicensed and shut it down. (It\u2019s certain that if they had investigated more deeply, they would have uncovered Madoff\u2019s fraud in its early stages.)Several thousand of the defunct fund\u2019s investors simply opened their own individual accounts with Madoff and handed their money right back to him. Suddenly, Madoff had to find a way to issue bogus monthly account statements, not to a dozen or so investors, but to thousands of them. DiPascali solved the problem by using software to distribute the fake trades in just the right proportion across what soon became several thousand accounts.In a sense, DiPascali had helped Madoff\u2019s achieve with his Ponzi scheme what Madoff\u2019s firm had helped the Nasdaq market achieve: computer-driven automation. Before this innovation, each fake transaction had to be documented manually in each client\u2019s account statements. With this new software, DiPascali had made the fraud scalable in a way that it had never been before. With a few keystrokes, one fake trade could be reflected, in the correct proportions, across hundreds or thousands of individual accounts.The computers, and the fraud, ground to a halt on Dec. 11, 2008. Early that day, the F.B.I. arrested Madoff at his penthouse, acting on a report filed the previous night by his two sons. A few hours later, agents arrived at 885 Third Avenue to gather evidence \u2013 evidence that would have Frank DiPascali\u2019s fingerprints all over it. DiPascali eventually struck a deal with prosecutors to trade his testimony for possible leniency.After confessing to his own role in the fraud in court in August 2009, DiPascali told the judge that he was led astray by his intense loyalty to Madoff. DiPascali then shed that loyalty with remarkable speed: In secret grand-jury hearings and public courtroom proceedings, he provided a wealth of damning testimony against his revered mentor and most of the colleagues who worked for him.DiPascali\u2019s betrayal could be seen, in a strange way, as the ultimate tribute to Madoff, a man who built an empire on misplaced faith. Like Madoff, DiPascali had learned to cultivate the trust of others and keep it, through thick and thin. He had lied to customers, perjured himself in testimony to regulators and overseen the creation of countless false documents to satisfy outside auditors. Like Madoff, he was just as convincing when he was lying as when he was telling the truth, a skill that served him well on both sides of the law. After spending 10 months in jail in 2009 and 2010, he convinced a federal judge he would not flee if he were released on bail, despite the potential 125-year sentence hanging over his head. (He died before he was sentenced.) And he convinced grand jurors and trial jurors that he was, finally, coming clean about Madoff\u2019s crimes.Was he? To the end, DiPascali maintained in court that he had believed Madoff had billions in unseen assets that he would use to make his defrauded investors whole. If DiPascali truly believed that, of course, the biggest lie he ever told was to himself.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of the high school that Frank DiPascali Jr. attended. It is Archbishop Molloy High School, in Queens, not Malloy.Diana B.

{"Headline": "Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory\u00a0Recalls False Bid Similar to One at Avon", "Date": "2015-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt was ludicrous,\u201d Mr. Merryman said. \u201cWe had to respond to it and investigate it, get our attorneys involved, even though we knew this was fraudulent.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is submit a form,\u201d Mr. Merryman said. The issue of just how much vetting the S.E.C. does of applicants who seek permission to submit filings to the Edgar system is in the spotlight after what was apparently a fraudulent takeover bid for Avon Products. The bid to buy Avon was submitted Thursday morning by another previously unknown British investment firm over the Edgar online system.The S.E.C. issued a statement Thursday evening that said, \u201cFilers are responsible for the truthfulness of their filings, and they are subject to enforcement actions when they are false or misleading.\u201d Regulators say they will investigate the matter.But the S.E.C. did not clarify what checks are made on investment firms and individuals who apply for access codes to Edgar. Several people with knowledge of the Edgar application process said the S.E.C. did not conduct much vetting beyond confirming that the application was complete and had been notarized.Notaries public, who are issued licenses in the states where they operate, typically charge fees of $10 or less to put a stamp on a document and vouch for the authenticity of a signature.The idea of relying on a notary public to verify the identity of a signer of a public filing may seem like something from the era of the television show \u201cMad Men.\u201d But in 2004, when the S.E.C. adopted the requirement, it was seen as something of a leap forward by regulators.Before 2004, Edgar access applications were submitted to the S.E.C. on paper, generally by mail. The S.E.C. rule change permitted applicants to file online for Edgar access codes as long as the signature on the application was verified by a notary.The requirement was not popular at the time. Most of the two dozen comment letters on the rule change raised objections.Sullivan & Cromwell, a New York law firm that represents many of Wall Street\u2019s biggest financial firms, said in its comment letter that the notary requirement would create an \u201cadministrative burden\u201d and was unnecessary \u201cin light of the penalties already provided for under the federal securities law for false or misleading statements.\u201d In adopting the rule, the S.E.C. said it had considered the objections but concluded that \u201chuman intervention in the current nonautomated process helps to assure authenticity.\u201dOfficials with the S.E.C. say they believe there is a trade-off if they do anything that might extend the application process and potentially slow the release of information, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. This person also noted that there appear to be only a handful of situations involving false filings.Mr. Merryman said that to the best of his knowledge, the S.E.C. never investigated the fake bid involving his company, although the company did respond to a letter from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the securities industry\u2019s primary self-regulatory organization. He said Rocky Mountain Chocolate\u2019s own investigation traced an email that had sent a copy of the takeover letter to a website from Bulgaria.In the Rocky Mountain Chocolate case, the false takeover offer came from a firm calling itself PST Capital Partners. The supposed bid for Avon came from a firm called PTG Capital Partners.The S.E.C. database lists the place of incorporation for both PTG Capital and PST Capital as the British Indian Ocean Territory, an archipelago of more than 2,000 small islands. A telephone number for PST is no longer in operation, and the phone number for PTG is no longer accepting messages.Thomas Sporkin, a lawyer with BuckleySandler who spent nearly two decades as an S.E.C. enforcement lawyer, said regulators had limited resources to review Edgar applications. He said there was \u201conly so much you can do\u201d to ensure that people did not abuse the system. In its statement on Thursday, the S.E.C. noted that there are about 4,000 filings a day to the Edgar system and more than 300,000 permitted users.Still, Mr. Merryman said something needed to be done. \u201cFor us, it was a big waste of time and money,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fiat Boss Too Cautious on Case for Industry Consolidation", "Date": "2015-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSergio Marchionne is fighting for automobile industry mergers with one hand tied behind his back.He laid out a strong but surprisingly public case for mergers last month, arguing that about half the capital spending on new car development duplicates rivals\u2019 efforts. The waste, he said, stops the industry from beating its cost of capital and causes auto stocks to trade at low multiples.Yet he pegs the maximum amount of synergies from potential deals at just 4.5 billion euros, or $5 billion, a year. That\u2019s almost 2 percent of total industry sales, roughly what Daimler and Chrysler reckoned they could trim in their ill-fated 1998 merger. Applying the figures to a G.M.-Fiat Chrysler tie-up would imply a 2014 pretax margin of 6.4 percent for the combined company, excluding one-off items.That easily beats the 1.75 percent that Mr. Marchionne managed last year, but it\u2019s not much more than what his counterpart Mary Barra achieved at General Motors. It would take several years to accomplish, too. Meanwhile, Detroit\u2019s biggest carmaker, presumably the buyer, would be saddled with lower returns and higher debt and have few benefits to look forward to.G.M. and Fiat Chrysler have far more overlap than Daimler-Chrysler, though. Mr. Marchionne\u2019s analysis excluded reductions in staff and brands, probably to avoid angering unions and governments fearful of mass job losses.When a G.M.-Chrysler merger was a talking point in 2008, cost cuts were estimated at $10 billion. Factor in meshing Fiat and G.M.-owned Opel in Europe, and the figure could hit $15 billion or more. That would be worth almost $100 billion to shareholders, once taxed, capitalized and discounted \u2013 more than the two companies\u2019 current market value. The resulting pretax margin of 10 percent could make the deal more than a little enticing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British \u2018Flash Crash\u2019 Trader to Appeal Bail Terms", "Date": "2015-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader accused of helping cause the stock market \u201cflash crash\u201d in 2010, will appear in the High Court in London next week to appeal the terms of his bail. Mr. Sarao, 36, has been in jail since he was arrested on April 21.He faces 22 charges in the United States, including wire fraud, commodities manipulation and commodities fraud over his role in the \u201cflash crash,\u201d when stocks plunged in just minutes and then quickly recovered, causing panic among professional and retail investors alike.The trader is fighting extradition to the United States. His bail was set at 5.05 million pounds, which he has been unable to meet. As a result, he comes to court every Wednesday, dressed in various track suits, to discuss the terms of his release.At his first bail hearing, his lawyer said he was a man of means with access to more than \u00a35 million in trading and betting accounts, though they said one of those accounts included a \u00a34.7 million loan.His lawyers quickly learned that his worldwide assets were frozen, making it impossible to raise the \u00a35 million he owed (his parents and brothers are required to put up another \u00a350,000). They appealed the bail decision on the basis that he had no access to funds and asked that his release be conditional on only the \u00a350,000.District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe refused that request, and his team will appeal that decision on May 20 in the High Court. It emerged on Wednesday that Mr. Sarao has been granted legal aid.United States authorities say that that he made $40 million with his trading, which he allegedly conducted out of a simple row house near Heathrow Airport, where he lives with his parents.Last week, he said that he had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d and \u201cI am just good at my job.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of the bail set for Navinder Singh Sarao, the trader accused of helping cause the stock market \u201cflash crash.\u201d It is 5.05 million pounds, not 5.05 billion pounds.Advertisement"}
