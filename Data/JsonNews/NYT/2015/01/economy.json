{"Headline": "America, Falling Short", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueReaders discuss whether America should adopt European-style policies for caring for the populace.\u00a0To the Editor:In most European countries mothers receive professional parenting support and almost full pay for many months in order to be with their newborns; we are the only developed country to have no maternity leave policy. And sadly we accept too easily that one in five of our children grow up in poverty, more than in most other developed countries.Nor are we troubled that these other countries proudly provide all their citizens with complete medical coverage. Here many of our Republican-led states have, for political reasons, refused to take the 100 percent financing from Washington to extend Medicaid to more people.On most indexes of people\u2019s well-being, the United States lags far behind comparable nations. The time has come for Americans to acknowledge that we as a nation are failing our citizens. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow but an essential stimulant to political action, both in the streets and in the polling booths, to right the deplorable way we allow our enormous wealth to be used for private rather than public purposes.The quest for an American exceptionalism of which we could once again be proud has the potential for bringing our nation together across political lines. This agenda must be in the forefront as we begin the new year and look ahead to the 2016 campaign.The writer is professor emeritus of education at Queens College and founder of its Big Buddy program, which pairs college students with homeless youths.\u00a0Readers ReactBravo to Mr. Salz! As an American who has had the recent pleasure of living in Switzerland, I find myself bemused and puzzled by conservative talk of European \u201cdysfunction.\u201d I am sure that many European countries have their problems, but the Switzerland that I lived in was a place of superb public transportation; excellent environmental protection; wonderful parks, roads and other public services; and clean cities.It was also a place where my many low-income friends \u2014 among them artists and single mothers \u2014 could live productive, creative lives free from crushing anxieties about health care, child care, leisure time and other necessities of life. And, of course, it was a place full of prosperous corporations and individuals, their rise manifestly unimpeded (in any meaningful way) by the stronger social contract.It can be done, folks. If we in American perceive public and private goods as locked in an unending, zero-sum struggle, with private gain ever the preferred winner, it is not because it has to be that way. It is because our political conversation has been hijacked by selfish and parochial moneyed interests.The choice is ours. A little more awareness of what other countries have been able to achieve might make us more confident in demanding the same thing here.\u00a0Social welfare and education systems in Europe vary far more than most Americans realize. Governments in relatively small, ethnically homogeneous countries, notably in Scandinavia, have had the easiest time redistributing wealth to achieve social goals. Social science strongly indicates an inverse relationship at the national level between diversity and support for social spending. Growing diversity due to migration and low European birthrates is posing a challenge to political support for social spending, even in traditionally very generous countries.The national contexts for decisions on social welfare policy vary greatly. Simply transferring models from one country to another is not realistic.The writer is a former Foreign Service officer who served in several European countries and has taught at universities in the Netherlands and Italy.\u00a0Mr. Salz\u2019s challenge to America will fall on deaf ears. A large portion of the American population is firmly in the selfish and greedy camp. I know of no other country where the poor and less well off are resented as actively as they are here, as if living on the pittance of government assistance offers a life of ease and leisure \u2014 turning the safety net into a \u201chammock,\u201d as Representative Paul D. Ryan put it. Try taking a drive through rural West Virginia to gauge the comfort of that hammock.The Republican Party reflects the \u201cI\u2019ve got mine\u201d attitude of too many Americans, who don\u2019t want \u201ctheir money\u201d going to pay for other people\u2019s needs. That is the essential problem, and it indeed makes us \u201cexceptional\u201d when compared with the more community-oriented attitudes of Europeans, Canadians or the inhabitants of other developed nations.In America, collective action on social issues is spat upon as \u201csocialism.\u201d As long as that is the case, we will continue to lag behind our peers in the measures that Mr. Salz enumerates.\u00a0Mr. Salz is right that America is failing our citizens, and we have the wild success of corporate influence to thank for it.Attempting to further beggar the 99 percent, business conservatives are waging county, state and federal campaigns to defund unions, thwart Medicaid expansion, support environmentally disastrous practices, overturn common-sense financial regulations, and lower taxes to \u201cstarve the beast\u201d and prove that government doesn\u2019t work.Mr. Salz provides a hope and a prayer, but the will to political action takes more than good wishes. We need to recognize what went wrong.We need to stop prioritizing the protection of disembodied corporate entities over the welfare of the American people. Until the thumb of the almighty dollar is lightened on the scales of justice, the game is fixed. Turning our will into action is our challenge.Mr. Snyder, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, is former director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union and a former member of the California Commission on Corporate Governance. Ms. Hutchison was his research assistant at Berkeley.\u00a0Mr. Salz raises a troubling set of questions and echoes the frustration that I believe many feel in thinking about America\u2019s problems. Part of the challenge is that public discourse too often begins from a position of false conflict: Two opposite analyses of problems are presented, as if only one could be true. And so conflicting solutions are proposed and little common ground is easily found.But at this point, we know enough to be able to say, for example, that good prenatal care and early childhood education help individuals grow and thrive and also save public dollars for health care and criminal justice, at least in the long run. We know that increasing wages of low-income workers results in a better quality of life for them and their families and also improves the economy because those workers spend most of what they make.There is common ground here, and there is no reason we can\u2019t rise above our impulse to oversimplify things and instead work for the betterment of all.\u00a0Mr. Salz\u2019s quest for \u201can American exceptionalism of which we could once again be proud\u201d sows the seeds of its own demise. Isn\u2019t \u201cexceptionalism\u201d just a euphemism for superiority, whether to other nations or other people? Call it what you will, it still smells of the very same inequality of which Mr. Salz rightly despairs.Maybe if we ditch the \u201cexceptionalism\u201d bit, then we could find an America of which we could all once again be proud.\u00a0Mr. Salz is right to point to lessons abroad, but we must look beyond Europe. Take Latin America as an example. It has been a leader in achieving near-universal access to health care by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations \u2014 such as Mexico\u2019s programs for pregnant women and children or Costa Rica\u2019s focus on insuring low-income communities and those without formal employment.Many Latin American cities once plagued by poverty and poor infrastructure are being transformed by urban planning initiatives connecting those in need to essential opportunities. The Bus Rapid Transit system in Curitiba, Brazil, for example, has served as a model to other cities for connecting low-income communities to urban jobs, while vastly reducing ambient air pollution.Medell\u00edn, Colombia, once notorious for its crime and violence, has reinvented itself through urban projects to rebuild the city\u2019s slums from the ground up. By expanding access to public transit, supporting local businesses, and strengthening the school systems, Medell\u00edn\u2019s focus on investing in the areas of greatest inequality has helped lift the well-being, safety and economic vitality of the entire metropolitan area.The common thread throughout these programs is a focus on building equitable communities, where everyone can participate and thrive. The lesson many leaders abroad are embracing \u2014 and that the United States should embrace \u2014 is that lifting up those so often left behind makes for stronger communities, and stronger economies, for everyone.The writer is founder and chief executive of PolicyLink, a research and social action institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity.\u00a0The Writer RespondsMr. Fagan and Mr. Snyder make related points that both the mood of the country and the financial might of corporate America preclude any move now toward the creation of progressive programs that are commonplace throughout Europe. While it is foolhardy not to acknowledge these obstacles, one can either capitulate or resist.For those of us who choose to continue the struggle, we have as our core belief that properly informed citizens will act in their enlightened self-interest to support social and educational programs that foster their own well-being and enhance the common good, the precise point made by Mr. Grimmett. With cultural issues less crucial in the minds of conservative voters, now is the time for a progressive leadership, an Elizabeth Warren, a Bernie Sanders, perhaps even Hillary Clinton, to move the conversation forward on the biggest stage possible, and in ways that might eventually lead to legislation limiting the power of politically active corporations.Mr. Clark\u2019s firsthand report on Switzerland describes how that country provides the necessary supportive environment for all its people, including its indigent, to live productive lives, without threatening corporate profits. So with interest piqued as to how other countries do it, we inform our citizens of the success of the Danish fast-food union winning $20 an hour through collective bargaining, and the fact that Ikea pays its furniture production workers in Sweden about twice what it pays workers in its Danville, Va., plant. Then let everyone look at the M.I.T. Living Wage Calculator with its picture of the shocking gap between typical American wages and what is required to provide bare-bones support for a family, and all this information might just move Americans to demand a resurgent labor movement.Couple this with an education from the Nobel Prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman as to the benefits of a sharply progressive income tax, a financial transaction tax, and other fiscal policies to raise sufficient revenue, and you\u2019ve created a nation of progressives. But all this takes time.Finally, Mr. Terzuolo is correct that increased immigration in Europe has led to small but growing hostility toward the foreign-born and the benefits they receive, and anger is likely to increase after the attack in Paris. But the percentage of immigrants in those countries is comparable to, or in some cases higher than, the United States, and to date there has been little change in their social welfare policies.I also agree with Mr. Terzuolo that one cannot automatically transfer social welfare policies from one country to another. But certainly nations can learn from the successes of other countries, and then adapt those policies to one\u2019s own situations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s How Lack of Competition Can Hurt Consumers", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsBusinesses are forever insisting that a little less competition won\u2019t lead to higher prices. What\u2019s one more merger? What\u2019s one more barrier to entry?A new study of the mortgage market nicely highlights just how little it can take to undermine competition to the point that it starts costing customers.The paper is both a critique of a specific government initiative \u2014 a refinancing program created after the financial crisis \u2014 and a clever use of that program to examine what happens when an industry\u2019s rule are suddenly changed.The Home Affordable Refinancing Program, or HARP, was started in 2009 to enable homeowners to refinance at lower rates even if they didn\u2019t have enough equity in the home to meet the standards of lenders, a common predicament after the nationwide collapse of housing prices. Borrowers with less than 20 percent equity found it all but impossible to refinance \u2014 and about 30 percent of people with mortgages were in that boat back in 2010.The mechanics are fairly simple: The government instructed the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee loans that replaced loans they had previously guaranteed, even if the amount of the loan exceeded 80 percent of the value of the home.Although, in theory, any lender can qualify for these guarantees, the rules of the program give a substantial advantage to the holder of the existing loan. If loans go bad, Fannie and Freddie can seek refunds. The HARP program grants lenders a measure of protection from this risk \u2014 but only if the company that refinanced the loan had also been the holder of the previous loan.In 2012, in an effort to increase participation in the program, the government granted incumbents even greater protection from such refund demands.Other lenders are still free to compete, but they don\u2019t. The study quotes research finding that 90 percent of loans refinanced under HARP were handled by the original lender, compared with 60 percent of refinances outside HARP.And here is the key discovery: Not surprisingly, Mr. Amromin and Ms. Kearns find incumbents have taken advantage of this absence of competition to impose above-market interest rates on borrowers \u2014 of about 15 to 20 basis points on average.The toll on each borrower was relatively modest. For every $100,000 borrowed at an interest rate of 4 percent, the borrower would pay an extra $139 in interest each year. But when all those extra payments were totaled, the windfall for the lenders was enormous. The transfer of wealth from borrowers to lenders as a consequence of the government\u2019s rules is at least $1 billion a year, according to the paper.The research underscores the importance of design. Particularly when costs and benefits are asymmetric \u2014 each borrower loses a little, and is unlikely to notice, while the banks are greatly enriched \u2014 the government officials who write the rules are not only the first but effectively the only line of defense for the public interest.It also suggests that the consolidation of the mortgage market since the financial crisis \u2014 as many lenders disappeared and others merged \u2014 may result in higher costs for borrowers in the future. Less competition, higher rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Perry Exits Texas Stage Making a Case for His Past, and His Future", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry leaves office here next week not so much as a man but as the face of an era \u2014 a 14-year reign in which he became the state\u2019s longest-serving chief executive and was widely regarded as the most powerful governor in the history of modern Texas.He turned a happenstance, unelected rise to office \u2014 going from lieutenant governor to governor in December 2000 after George W. Bush resigned to become president \u2014 into a one-man Republican dynasty, winning three four-year terms, making every appointment on every board and commission in the state and redefining the power of the governor\u2019s office.In a farewell speech to the Texas Legislature on Thursday, Mr. Perry made a spirited case for his tenure, boasting that Texas has become more prosperous and financially sound \u2014 with better schools, safer streets, cleaner air and fewer frivolous lawsuits \u2014 since he became governor.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason more people move to Texas than any other state, because this is the best place in the world to find a job and raise a family and to pursue your dreams,\u201d Mr. Perry, 64, told lawmakers at the Capitol.As Mr. Perry prepares to leave office and contemplates another run for the White House, his record as governor will be closely scrutinized not just for what it says about him and his legacy but also for what it says about the priorities he set and who has benefited from the state\u2019s prosperity. And while he and his supporters say the Texas economy thrived under his leadership \u2014 more than 30 percent of all the private-sector jobs added in the nation since January 2001 have been in Texas \u2014 critics and several economists say Mr. Perry is taking too much credit for the state\u2019s robust economy, and that the state has failed to adequately plan for the future.\u201cGovernor Perry has accomplished some notable things that have promoted economic growth, but he has not created a sustainable platform for long-term prosperity,\u201d said Ray Perryman, an expert on the Texas economy who has been called the unofficial state economist. \u201cI have a real concern that, as the agenda became more partisan over time, the long-term needs of the state in terms of public and higher education, transportation infrastructure, an adequate safety net and water have not been addressed.\u201dLast month, he met with influential Republican donors, policy experts and operatives whom he had invited to Austin, and he has spent months traveling the world and the country in an effort to repair his image after his mistake-prone 2012 bid for president. The Des Moines Register reported in November that Mr. Perry had been to Iowa eight times and had appeared at 33 events since the 2012 elections, more than any other potential 2016 Republican candidate.As governor, Mr. Perry was everywhere and into everything. Through his longevity, his thousands of appointees and the force of his personality and ambition, he dominated the state to such a degree that two lawmakers in his own party have proposed bills limiting future governors or other top officials to two consecutive four-year terms. Another sign of his clout and savvy has been the ease with which he has handled perhaps his biggest controversy: the criminal charges he faces accusing him of abuse of power.A grand jury here in Travis County indicted Mr. Perry last year after he pressed the district attorney, a Democrat, to step down by threatening to cut off state financing to the anticorruption unit in her office. Mr. Perry became the first Texas governor in nearly 100 years to face criminal charges. He and his lawyers deny any wrongdoing, and the case has become more of an annoyance than a crisis for him.\u201cHe took the governor\u2019s office to a higher level,\u201d said Mike Sullivan, 57, a Houston Republican who is the Harris County tax assessor and collector. \u201cI\u2019m a native Texan, a native Houstonian, and I grew up with the belief that the lieutenant governor\u2019s office was the strongest office. I think Governor Perry changed that.\u201dAt the heart of the argument for Mr. Perry\u2019s success as governor is his record on jobs. His office said Texas had added 1.8 million private-sector jobs since January 2001. Employment data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the numbers to be accurate. But the data also undercut his claim somewhat. Texas added a similar number of private-sector jobs \u2014 1.4 million \u2014 during the tenure of Mr. Perry\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Bush, who served nearly six years compared with Mr. Perry\u2019s 14.On Thursday, Mr. Perry defended the state\u2019s job growth, telling lawmakers that since December 2007, 1.4 million jobs had been created in Texas, while in that same period, the rest of the nation lost 400,000 jobs. \u201cI have been guided by a simple philosophy: that job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue generation,\u201d he said.Mr. Perry\u2019s figures were greeted with applause by legislators. Others were more skeptical.Professor Hamermesh and others said Mr. Perry benefited from a situation beyond his control \u2014 an oil and gas boom that has increased the state\u2019s tax revenues and created jobs across the state. But as the price of oil has plummeted in recent months, some lawmakers and analysts worry that the state\u2019s economy is headed for a slowdown at best, or a regional recession at worst.By any measure, Texas has boomed while Mr. Perry was in office. The state had replaced all the jobs it lost in the 2008 and 2009 recession by November 2011. The nation as a whole did not regain its lost jobs until May 2014. Last year, Toyota announced it would establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas suburb of Plano and relocate nearly 4,000 employees there from facilities in Southern California, Kentucky and New York.It was a key victory for Mr. Perry, who has ventured into states led by Democratic governors to woo businesses to Texas. The state offered Toyota $40 million in incentives from Mr. Perry\u2019s economic development fund, and a Toyota spokesman said the company had a long history of working with Mr. Perry. The spokesman said the governor was instrumental in helping Toyota open its San Antonio manufacturing plant in 2006.In his speech to lawmakers Thursday, and in a four-page summary of his accomplishments released by his office, Mr. Perry highlighted other achievements. Texas\u2019 air quality improved as pollution levels decreased from 2000 to 2012. The on-time graduation rate of its public high school students in 2012 was 88 percent, with Texas in a tie with Nebraska, Vermont and Wisconsin for the second-best in the nation. Texas\u2019 crime rate has dropped, and for the first time in its history it closed prisons without replacing them.But Mr. Perry\u2019s critics say that the jobs picture hides a dismal record on numerous issues. Texas has the highest rate in the nation of residents lacking health insurance, and it has some of the worst rates in the country of children living in poverty, teenage births, adults without high school diplomas and toxic chemicals released into waterways. As the population in Texas increases and its second-worst drought drags on, the state\u2019s water and transportation infrastructures have been in dire need of upgrading. Voters recently approved two propositions to finance improvements. But experts said the state failed for years to make infrastructure a priority. It was not until January 2013, 12 years after taking office, that Mr. Perry called on lawmakers to tap the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund for a one-time investment in water and transportation improvements. The state, meanwhile, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on border security.\u201cPerry has preferred to divert our attention to partisan social issues rather than tackle these more serious long-term challenges, and that is a terrible missed opportunity,\u201d said Mike Villarreal, a Democrat and former state lawmaker who is running for mayor of San Antonio.Still, perhaps offering a glimpse of how he plans to position himself should he run for president, Mr. Perry struck a distinctly bipartisan tone on Thursday, encouraging lawmakers to work across party lines, an appeal that may resonate more nationally than in a state where Republicans control almost all the levers of power.\u201cI speak to members of my own party in asking that you do not place purity ahead of unity,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cRonald Reagan knew that someone who agreed with you 80 percent of the time was not your enemy, but your friend. There\u2019s room for different voices, for disagreement. Compromise is not a dirty word if it moves Texas forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Australia", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThis four-bedroom, two-bath home in the town of Portsea on the Mornington Peninsula is on the market for $2.025 million.\u00a0It\u2019s an hour and 15 minutes by car from Melbourne\u2019s Central Business District. A FOUR-BEDROOM HOUSE IN A RESORT TOWN NEAR MELBOURNE$2.025 MILLION (2.5 MILLION AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS)A wood-burning fireplace warms the living room. A kitchen and a wet bar are tucked into windowed nooks. The countertops are cream granite, and the cabinets are charcoal-colored with hints of green. Red tones in the Tasmanian oak floors and built-in shelving warm the room\u2019s palette. The master suite is just off the living room, with access to the same balcony and sweeping views. The suite includes a walk-in closet and a bathroom lined with peach marble. Downstairs, three additional bedrooms share a full bath and a separate living area. An alcove is used as a study and an entertainment area. The house has a two-car garage. Outside, the pool is separated from the house by mature native trees and reached via a grassy path. The nearest beach is on the ocean side of the peninsula, where surfers and more intrepid swimmers congregate, a five-minute walk from the house. A quieter family-friendly beach on the bay side is a 15-minute walk. The coffee shops and boutiques of Portsea are also a 15 minute-walk, near the bay. MARKET OVERVIEWThe property market in Victoria experienced a slump after the global financial crisis, dropping 10 to 25 percent, depending on the area. But the market has been gradually recovering over the last few years, in part because of stimulus measures from the state government and a strengthening overall economy, said Jock Langley, a director of Abercromby\u2019s Real Estate, based in Melbourne. The number of foreigners showing interest in the market picked up about eight months ago, he said, resulting in an increase in prices and activity.Recovery has been quite strong in the luxury sector, largely fueled by foreign buyers. Mr. Langley said prices for Toorak, a high-end suburb close to Melbourne\u2019s Central Business District, are about 2,800 to 3,500 Australian dollars per square meter ($211 to $264 per square foot) on the low end, and 5,000 to 6,000 Australian dollars per square meter ($377 to $452 per square foot) on the high end, with some unusual sales ranging up to 9,000 Australian dollars per square meter ($678 per square foot).Mr. Langley said the market in Portsea, where this house is situated, is a bit softer than in Toorak, which is within easy commuting distance of the city. Prices in Portsea, more of a second-home area, can be hard to estimate because it is a small place with few sales, but Mr. Langley said clifftop homes with water views command the highest prices, sometimes as much as 23 million Australian dollars ($18,630,000) or more. \u201cThe cliff is the primo,\u201d he said. Homes without sea views sell for considerably less \u2014 typically around 3.1 to 3.2 million Australian dollars ($2.51 million to $2.59 million), he said. This home is priced lower because of its size. WHO BUYS IN VICTORIAThere has been an influx of buyers from Asia in recent years, according to Mr. Langley. Most are from mainland China, but Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are also represented. \u201cThey have a desire to come here because of the good economy and the lifestyle,\u201d he said. In addition, a relatively weak Australian dollar means foreign buyers can get more for their money. As for buyers from the United States, Mr. Langley said there are a handful of wealthy hedge fund owners, but American investment in Australia has been minimal recently. BUYING BASICSReal estate is usually sold at auction in Australia, according to Manuela Pless-Bennett, a sales associate with Melbourne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Buyers usually visit the property during an open house, then come to the auction and bid. If the house doesn\u2019t sell at auction, it stays on the market until a buyer is found or the seller takes it off the market. This house is being sold privately, not at auction.Most buyers don\u2019t have a real estate agent, although Ms. Pless-Bennett said buyer advocacy is growing in Australia. The buyer and the seller each pay legal fees of about 1,200 Australian dollars ($972), according to Robert Curtain, a real estate agent at the Sorrento office of Melbourne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and one of the listing agents for this property. Stamp duty in the state of Victoria is calculated by subtracting 100,000 Australian dollars ($81,000) from the purchase price; the buyer is charged 6 percent of that amount. If the house featured here sells for its asking price of 2.5 million Australian dollars ($2,025,000,) the stamp duty will be 129,000 Australian dollars ($104,490).The seller pays the real estate agent fees, which are capped by law at 3 percent of the purchase price, according to Ms. Pless-Bennett.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish; Australian dollar (1 Australian dollar = $0.81)TAXES AND FEESState taxes come to 1,142 Australian dollars ($925) annually for this house; local taxes are 4,255 Australian dollars ($3,447), according to Mr. Curtain.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Devil May Be in the Details on European Central Bank Bond-Buying", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A court opinion issued on Wednesday makes it all but certain that the European Central Bank will announce a major round of economic stimulus next week, after months of contentious internal debate.But much mystery remains about how the bank will deploy quantitative easing \u2014 buying government bonds on a large scale to pump money into the economy.The central bank still needs to decide the amount and the mix of bonds, including whether riskier nations such as Greece should be avoided. They must also navigate thorny political issues, like the concerns of Germany, whose opposition to E.C.B. bond-buying has long been the main impediment to action.It is a moment of truth for the central bank and a test of whether its president, Mario Draghi, can finesse the details while leaving no doubt about his institution\u2019s resolve to reinvigorate the eurozone economy.If it is not big or broad enough, the program might not work to revive the region. And many of the economists who have been saying for a year or more that the European Central Bank needs to take this stimulus step contend that when the move finally comes, it could be too little, too late. Some even predict that at its much-anticipated meeting next week, the central bank will announce only its intention to engage in bond-buying and wait until the next meeting, in March, to provide the details.\u201cThey have always been too late,\u201d said Adalbert Winkler, a former economist at the central bank who is now a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management and an advocate of quantitative easing. \u201cThe last five years, if they had been more aggressive, maybe we could have avoided this discussion.\u201dA solid majority on the central bank\u2019s 25-member Governing Council appears, based on recent public statements, to favor broad bond-buying. Their position was strengthened by the opinion submitted to the highest European appeals court on Wednesday in response to a lawsuit by German citizens seeking to block a previously planned bond-buying program that Mr. Draghi announced in 2012 but never deployed.The opinion, by an adviser who considers legal arguments for the court, affirmed the European Central Bank\u2019s freedom to intervene in bond markets, with only minor restrictions. The opinion \u2014 it is not binding, but the court typically follows such guidance \u2014 could also help insulate the central bank from future lawsuits by warning lower courts to be cautious about interfering in monetary policy.In principle, quantitative easing is simple and well tested. It has been used by the Federal Reserve in the United States, which began a series of bond-buying programs in the aftermath of the financial crisis that is credited with helping to revive the American economy. Britain, too, has used quantitative easing to similar effect.Under such a program, the central bank buys large amounts of government bonds and other assets, paid for with newly created money. Such purchases help drive down market interest rates, inject money into the economy and push inflation up from dangerously low levels considered incompatible with growth.After that, it gets complicated.Should the European Central Bank buy bonds from all 19 eurozone countries, and in what proportions? If from all eurozone members, then how should it handle Greece? The country is poised to elect a new government that could repudiate some of the billions of euros of loans the country owes as part of its international bailout. And how to keep the Germans on board?Mr. Draghi has resolved to jolt inflation back to the central bank\u2019s official target of \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2 percent. And yet, consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in December, raising the specter of a downward price spiral that could further undercut wages and growth.Because of the large number of unanswered questions, the European Central Bank may not be ready to announce details of a bond-buying program next week.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for the E.C.B. in this environment not to act,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group. But, he said, \u201cWe think it\u2019s a two-step move \u2014 announcement in January, further details in March.\u201dSome elements of such a program are a given. The central bank would buy bonds on the open market \u2014 not directly from governments, which would be a violation of its charter.But the bank will have to figure out how to deal with the lack of Pan-European assets comparable to the United States Treasury bonds that the Fed purchased in its quantitative easing program.The simplest and most likely option would be to buy bonds in proportion to each eurozone country\u2019s share of the central bank\u2019s capital, which is calculated according to each member state\u2019s population and gross domestic product.The drawback to this method is that it would mean buying large quantities of German government bonds, which are already in heavy demand \u2014 so much so that on Wednesday the yield on the 10-year German bond reached a new low.Germany accounts for 18 percent of the European Central Bank\u2019s capital, more than any other country. (Malta, with 0.65 percent of the central bank\u2019s capital, has the smallest share.) Market interest rates on some other German government bonds are already below zero. So it is not clear what purpose, if any, would be served by pushing the rates even lower, as would happen if the European Central Bank started buying.A second option would be to buy only highly rated government bonds \u2014 those of France, Finland and Germany, say, while avoiding the bonds of governments with riskier finances, like Portugal or Greece. That approach would answer German concerns that taxpayers could be stuck with the bill if some eurozone governments were to default on their debt.In theory, if the European Central Bank drove up the prices of highly rated bonds, private investors would turn to the bonds of weaker countries instead. But it is not certain that would happen. If not, the E.C.B. would not achieve its goal of providing relief in heavily indebted countries like Italy.A third option would be to buy bonds in proportion to the outstanding debt of each eurozone country \u2014 the higher the debt level, the more bonds the central bank would buy. This alternative would favor countries that are the most deeply in debt and need the most help, like Italy. But conservative critics in Germany would probably complain that these countries were being rewarded for irresponsibly running up huge debts.Every option has negative side effects. But Mr. Winkler of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management said that did not mean the central bank should sit on its hands. \u201cIf you are about to drown,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t worry about the possibility of having a heart attack a week later.\"Whatever the method used by the central bank, the next big question is how much to buy. The central bank has implicitly set a target of expanding its balance sheet, a measure of the volume of its stimulus, by 1 trillion euros, or about $1.18 trillion.The bank has already been buying private sector assets, including bundles of real estate loans. But the amount so far, about \u20ac33 billion, is clearly inadequate to meet the balance-sheet goal. Most of the rest would have to come from government bonds, the most abundant asset available.Analysts at Nomura in London estimate that the European Central Bank would have to spend at least \u20ac700 billion on eurozone government bonds. But rather than setting the long-range target, Nomura analysts said in a note to clients last week, the central bank will probably announce monthly targets of around \u20ac55 billion, which could be adjusted to reflect changes in the inflation rate or other economic developments.Among economists, there is widespread skepticism about whether any amount of bond-buying will solve the eurozone\u2019s growth and inflation problem. There is already plenty of money in the system, they say. The problems, many economists argue, lie in economic drags that are beyond the control of Mr. Draghi and the central bank \u2014 that it takes too long to get a building permit in Italy, for example, or that there are too many restrictions on hiring and firing in France.\u201cI don\u2019t think what he does,\u201d said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., \u201cis going to make any difference for the economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname, on second reference, of Adalbert Winkler, an advocate of quantatitive easing. He is Mr. Winkler, not Mr. Adalbert.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Day After President\u2019s Speech, Some Doubts Linger Over Nation\u2019s Recovery", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 As a web developer benefiting from an 8 percent pay raise, Brad McLaughlin is looking good economically. He and his girlfriend are spending more money on natural groceries, ski weekends in Colorado\u2019s mountains and vacations to England and Austin, Tex. Not that he credits President Obama for any of it.\u201cDemocrats are big with taxes, taking more money away than putting it back,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin, 31, said on a snowy Wednesday morning as he waited for the bus. Still, he said it was undeniable that the economy here was chugging along: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely getting better.\u201dMr. Obama hailed last year as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d for the American economy in his State of the Union address, pointing to a surging stock market and millions of new jobs as indelible signs that the country had finally shed the shadows of years of false starts, uneven recovery and stagnation. And in interviews across the country Wednesday, everywhere from flower shops in Georgia to the streets of downtown Chicago and cafes near San Francisco, people acknowledged they were feeling the benefits of stronger sales, lower gas prices and healthier job markets. But unease lingered among those who said they were still earning less than before the recession and thought that Mr. Obama was overselling the recovery. And while they rallied to Mr. Obama\u2019s call to help the middle class and create an economy \u201cthat generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who made the effort,\u201d they worried that many workers were never going to thrive in the modern era. \u201cThere are really two economies now,\u201d said Jeff Binder, the chief executive of Layer3 TV, a cable-television start-up that moved its headquarters to Denver\u2019s bustling lower downtown neighborhood from Boston last year. \u201cThere are pockets in industry and geography that are booming. Oil and gas are booming; the city of Denver is booming; but there are other places that clearly are not.\u201dHis company has created about 60 jobs in the past year, but Mr. Binder said that vacancies often showed the structural problems in the economy. His business sometimes struggles to find qualified candidates for technologically demanding positions, but it is deluged with 700 applicants when it needs to hire an accountant.Donald Castillo, 52, said he was not experiencing the boom. He has survived on part-time work and odd jobs since losing his job as the manager of a Safeway grocery store two years ago. He said that he had installed Christmas d\u00e9cor in wealthy neighborhoods this winter, but that the money he made was not enough to rent an apartment in Denver\u2019s competitive housing market. Despite his struggles and the stark inequality he sees every day, he said he believed Mr. Obama was the one who could help lift people like him out of poverty. \u201cHe keeps his mind on the average man,\u201d Mr. Castillo said. Around the country, people said that as they drove through their neighborhoods and downtowns, they were seeing more signals of a spreading turnaround. New businesses are opening. More posters say \u201cnow hiring,\u201d and fewer declare \u201cforeclosure\u201d or \u201cgoing out of business.\u201dBut even the encouraging signs, like rising real estate values, had a double edge to some. The construction cranes in New York, Chicago and Denver represented jobs and growth, but the luxury condominiums they were building seemed like emblems of a recovery that was bypassing many families.\u201cThe middle class is carrying the burden right now,\u201d said Joe Oncina, an information technician in wealthy Marin County, Calif., who spent Wednesday morning entering last year\u2019s real estate sales into the county\u2019s computer system. The median sales price was about $1 million. \u201cHopefully by taxing the wealthier, we can open more programs to support people who need it.\u201dBut people said they expected little out of a divided government that to them still seems paralyzed and partisan. Joan Rhodes, 61, who works at the Church Street Antique Market in Covington, Ga., said she was glad the Republicans were running Congress, and she criticized Mr. Obama for laying out an agenda that seemed more confrontational than conciliatory. \u201cHe said he\u2019s going to veto everything he doesn\u2019t want,\u201d Ms. Rhodes said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be his way.\u201dOthers were exhausted with both parties. Mary Crowe, who was sitting on a park bench in Chicago, said she felt as if nothing was improving. \u201cI think it\u2019s still the same,\u201d said Ms. Crowe, a mechanic who lives in Chicago and said she did not vote or follow politics. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you put in there. Everything is going to go downhill anyway.\u201d While Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings have ticked higher recently as economic growth has expanded, people were also sharply divided on whether he deserved credit for the improving economy. Some said Mr. Obama\u2019s policies had put the country back on the right footing, but others said that businesses and workers, not Washington leaders, were the ones who had done the heavy lifting.\u201cIt\u2019s God and hard work and dedication,\u201d said Shannon Keith, 44, who lost his job as a forklift operator in the Atlanta area around the time of Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008. The day is seared into Mr. Keith\u2019s memory: A man separated the workers into two groups, those who had been employed for more than a decade and those who had been there for less. Mr. Keith said he and everyone else with more than 10 years\u2019 employment had been told to be gone by noon.Mr. Keith said he had been unemployed for nearly three years during the stuttering recovery and had moved in with his parents to avoid sleeping on the streets. But these days, his fortunes have rebounded, he said. He found work with a company in Atlanta and is trying to get a place of his own again.Robert Frizzell, 52, a Democrat who installs car stereos in Chelsea, Mass., a working-class city just north of Boston, said that his business had nearly doubled in the past year. While he spent the early days of the recovery doing mostly high-end work, such as installing stereos in boats, these days he is putting stereos into all kinds of cars \u2014 a sign that a wider spectrum of people have a little extra to spend.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people now that are keeping their older cars and making them nice again, or trying to,\u201d Mr. Frizzell said. \u201cThey have some fun money.\u201dStill, Mr. Frizzell gave Mr. Obama little credit. The recovery has been painfully slow, he said. He still worries about the deficit, even though it has fallen from more than an annual $1 trillion to about $480 billion in 2014.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s a mess,\u201d he said of the government. \u201cI think it\u2019s more so the people are more resilient; they make things happen.\u201dUnderlying many people\u2019s anxieties was a worry that hard work no longer guaranteed them the ability to buy a nice house, send their children to college and retire comfortably. In Woburn, Mass., Michelle Hernandez, 27, an immigrant from El Salvador who is not eligible to vote, said she was hopeful that Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to expand free community college might help her achieve the economic mobility that has eluded her during his time in office.\u201cI think he\u2019s tried to help us,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the government is not just him.\u201dShe said she worked about 60 hours a week at a grocery store and a cafe. It is enough to pay her bills but not to save for her future or to pursue a career as a medical assistant.\u201cI\u2019ve worked at the grocery store for five years, and I\u2019m trying to get full time, but it\u2019s not available,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you cannot get benefits like vacation days, sick days.\u201dBack in Denver, it took Jason Decoste nearly eight months to find a job at the gourmet hot dog restaurant where he has now worked for two years. He has received one raise and now makes $8.85 an hour. He works seven days a week, and most of the money goes toward raising his young son. Mr. Decoste is sleeping on a friend\u2019s borrowed couch in a suburb south of Denver, and said he felt as if he was barely treading water. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a place right now, that\u2019s how messed up it is,\u201d he said. He said that bad personal choices over the years had set him back, but that he also felt as if the recovery had passed him by: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the rich stay rich, and helping us stay where we\u2019re at.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood in Boston; Alan Blinder in Lithonia, Ga.; Ronnie Cohen in Marin County, Calif.; Mitch Smith in Chicago; and Julie Turkewitz in Denver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Isn't Turning Backward", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 I am a patriot. Being German, those words don\u2019t come easily, particularly for a leftish, skeptical urbanite like myself. And particularly not now, just a few days before we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. But yes, I love my country.The reason I say it out loud, now, is that I feel I have to defend Germany against those on the streets of Dresden who also call themselves \u201cpatriots\u201d \u2014 \u201cPatriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West,\u201d to be precise, which is the name of a loose alliance that brings thousands to the streets every Monday. Since the terror attacks in Paris, the movement has grown: The police counted 25,000 demonstrators on Jan. 12, the Monday after the attacks, a 7,500 jump from the week before. (It canceled its Jan. 19 protest over security concerns.)Known by its German acronym, Pegida, the group has inflicted great harm on the country\u2019s international reputation. Our neighbors and allies are asking whether Germany is stumbling back into the darkness of xenophobia, and rightfully so. Many Germans are asking the same question these days.There are two ways to look at the situation. The optimistic take is to note that, for all the attention Pegida gets inside of Germany and abroad, Germany has never been as liberal, culturally diverse and open toward minorities as it is today.Apart from the polls, there is quite a bit of evidence for a new openness. On Jan. 12, 100,000 people went to the streets nationwide in counterdemonstrations against Pegida, showing their solidarity with German Muslims. In Leipzig, 4,800 pro-Pegida protesters were met by 30,000 counterprotesters.Meanwhile, all over Germany, private initiatives are popping up to help refugees. In Duisburg, a local politician has collected 100 bicycles for refugee children. In Zirndorf, doctors are providing refugees with free medication. Even in Dresden, Pegida\u2019s stronghold, groups are helping refugees with the hard tasks of getting settled, like providing translation services at appointments with authorities.Still, the enormous support for Pegida requires us to consider another, darker reading of the situation, as evidence of troubling developments within German society.One is the failure of mainstream politics. There is a tendency among the major parties to move toward the center of the political spectrum, creating an ideological void at its far right and left ends. The far right in particular has lacked political representation in the past years, which helps explain why a new populist party, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, had such enormous success in European and state elections last year. While leaders of the Alternative, as it\u2019s called, claim to be primarily anti-European Union, many have also expressed support for Pegida.Another change revolves around the Internet. In this view, the Pegida people are just the usual frustrated lot looming at the edges of society. Now, emboldened by the reinforcement they find in like-minded communities online, they\u2019re taking to the streets.And a third is the persistence of regional differences. Though Pegida has drawn support in western Germany, it is strongest in the former East Germany. In the East, xenophobic attitudes are still more common than in the West, for a complex mix of reasons, including higher unemployment rates, but also because of feelings of inferiority.We also have to ask what Pegida says about Germany, whatever its causes. It certainly indicates that the relative social peace we are experiencing right now is fragile. But it also shows how the country, still new to the multiethnic game, is struggling with its identity. It wasn\u2019t until the 1950s that the first waves of immigrants arrived, the \u201cGastarbeiter\u201d (guest workers) from Turkey and Italy who came to fill the labor gap in the country\u2019s prospering postwar economy.For decades, Germany was able to pretend that the guest workers were just that, guests. But the third generation of Turkish immigrants is now reaching adulthood. At the same time, immigration numbers are rising: Germany\u2019s immigrant population grew by about 430,000 last year. Many came from the Southern European countries that still suffer from the euro crisis, but last year Germany also welcomed some 220,000 refugees, mostly from Syria, Eritrea, Serbia and Afghanistan.The white face of German society is changing at a rapid pace. In this context, the Pegida protests are getting such attention because they act as a weekly checkup of German society. It\u2019s as if every Monday, the news media are putting a trembling hand to the country\u2019s forehead, checking its temperature, wondering whether our ugly, xenophobic past is taking over again. And we don\u2019t have to look back to the 1930s to find that past; in the early 1990s, when the country last saw similar numbers of refugees, an irrational fear of foreigners taking the jobs of \u201creal Germans\u201d gripped the country, culminating in anti-immigrant riots in several cities, with several deaths, many wounded and thousands scared.Last week, a 20-year-old refugee from Eritrea was found stabbed to death near his apartment in Dresden. Neighbors reported that swastikas had been painted onto the door of his apartment. Germans held their breath. Was this a neo-Nazi murder? Was there a connection to the Pegida rallies? Then, on Thursday, authorities arrested one of the victim\u2019s roommates, another asylum seeker, who they say has admitted to the attack. Still, we don\u2019t trust ourselves. Why should our neighbors? Why should you?However the investigation turns out, I am an optimist, believing that we will not see history repeated. Germany has come a long way since even the early \u201990s. And rather than causing violence, Pegida has set off a public debate on Germany\u2019s national identity. This is long overdue. Prominent conservative politicians like Peter Tauber, the secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party, have demanded a new, clearer framework for immigration. Last week, Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that \u201cIslam is part of Germany.\u201d It was an assessment, rather than an ideological statement. It was the simple acknowledgment of a simple reality.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on\nthe opinion page of the daily\nnewspaper Der Tagesspiegel.Advertisement"}

First, to Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy, who said it all. Bob and I have had a heck of a four years together. A lot of late nights, a lot of stress. A lot of bad days, a lot of good days. And in going through the situation that we went through, you really learn a lot about the other person. And a finer public servant, a finer man I have never worked with in my life than Bob Duffy. He epitomizes everything the administration is about. He is hard work. He\u2019s integrity. He\u2019s performance. And he\u2019s in the business for all the right reasons. We\u2019re really going to miss him. We love him. Let\u2019s give him a big round of applause, Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy.So we really did have big shoes to fill, literally and metaphorically, when we had to replace Bob Duffy. And we found a superstar, and you heard from her now. The more you see her, the more you\u2019re going to love her. She is great. Former congresswoman from Buffalo, N.Y., and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. Let\u2019s give her a round of applause.I want to thank Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, who is very impressive. Court of Appeals judge. I wonder who appointed her. Oh, I did. That\u2019s right. Let\u2019s give her a round of applause, Sheila Abdus-Salaam.My good friend for many years, Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much for being with us, Mayor.We have our friends from the congressional delegation. Senator Chuck Schumer, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Congressman Pete King, Congressman Engel, I see. Congressman Gregory Meeks \u2014 that\u2019s too good-looking to be Gregory Meeks. Is that Gregory? The congressional delegation is very important to the way we do business, for the state to do what it needs to do \u2014 Congresswoman Nita Lowey! \u2014 for the state to do what it needs to do as aggressively as we\u2019ve been doing it. We really need the federal government to be part of it and to be working with us, and they have been there every step of the way. I call Senator Schumer sometimes; I ask him for some things and I can hear the shock on the other end of the phone. But he never says no, and he always goes to it, and they have delivered for us time and time again \u2014 whether it\u2019s money for Hurricane Sandy, $60 billion, money for the Tappan Zee Bridge that Congresswoman Lowey got us. Time and time again, they\u2019ve been there. We couldn\u2019t do what we do without them. Let\u2019s give them a round of applause. We thank them very much.And Speaker Silver and Senator Marty Golden who represent the Senate and the Assembly for us today, who are our partners every step of the way: Pleasure to be with you. Thank them.Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins: Pleasure to be with you, Andrea. Thank you for your leadership.County Executive Mangano, County Executive Bellone, and Linda Mangano, pleasure to be with you.You heard from Reverend Karim Camara, who gave us the opening prayer. He\u2019s also a fantastic, fantastic assemblyman. Pleasure to be with you, Reverend Karim Camara.Rabbi Michael Miller, who did the opening. He also brought us to Israel right at the time of the intifada, when Israel was really going through a period of violence. We said that was the best time to go because we wanted to make a statement. Some people didn\u2019t understand that logic immediately, but it was the best time to go in terms of a show of solidarity. And I knew Michael in New York and how great he was in New York. You see him in Israel, he\u2019s even stronger.

I\u2019m just the good looks of the operation, I want you to know, they really \u2014 yeah, then we\u2019d be really in trouble. But it is about my team.

So they are my family, and they\u2019ve been great all through this.We\u2019re missing one family member. My father\u2019s not here with us today. We hoped that he was going to be able to come. He\u2019s at home, and he\u2019s not well enough to come. We spent last night with him. We changed the tradition a little bit. We weren\u2019t in Albany last night. We stayed at my father\u2019s house to ring in the New Year with him. I went through the speech with him. He said it was good \u2014 especially for a second-termer. See? My father\u2019s a third-termer. But, he sends his regards to all of you. He couldn\u2019t be here physically today, my father. But my father is in this room. He\u2019s in the heart and mind of every person who\u2019s here. He\u2019s here, and he\u2019s here, and his inspiration and his legacy and his experience is what has brought this state to this point. So let\u2019s give him a round of applause.And I want to thank you all very much for taking the time to be here on a New Year. It\u2019s fitting. When we begin a new year, it\u2019s a natural point of reflection. We review the past, we plan for the future, we make great resolutions on how we\u2019re going to do even better. I want you to know that my resolutions are still intact. It\u2019s been 12 hours, which is a new record for me.Four years ago, when I took office, as you heard from Kathy and you heard from Bob, New York was a much, much different place. And we were facing daunting challenges. More people unemployed than at any time since the Great Depression, when we took over. Upstate New York was hemorrhaging young people. You\u2019d go to the airports, and you\u2019d see young people getting on planes because they believed there was no future left in upstate New York. The state government, that was supposed to help, was supposed to be solving problems, was all about gridlock and all about dysfunction. And there was a pervasive, foreboding sense that the best days of New York were behind it, and that it was getting worse. And you felt that sense growing. I said at my first inauguration that we can\u2019t underestimate the severity of the times, that this was not a moment for more speeches. It was about action. It was about results, and it was not about rhetoric. And that is what we did. We made the government work. We restored the economy. We created 500,000 private-sector jobs. This state today has 7.6 million jobs, more jobs than have ever existed in the history of the State of New York. That\u2019s what we have today.We turned a $10 billion deficit into a $5 billion surplus. We put cranes in the sky in places that thought they were extinct. We expanded affordable housing. We passed universal pre-K. We gave hard-working families a tax cut. We expanded health care to cover \u2014 1.5 million more New Yorkers are covered now than there were before. We made New York fairer with marriage equality. We made New York safer by passing sensible gun control. We set a national standard and committed this state to be the first state in the nation to end the AIDS epidemic in the next decade, and we\u2019re going to do it.We did this. And the emphasis is on the \u201cwe.\u201d We are the upstate business people who chose to stay and continue to hope. We are the public employees \u2014 the teachers, the police, the firefighters who serve and protect. We are the members of the New York State Assembly. We are the members of the New York State Senate. We are the colleagues in the federal delegation. We are Republicans and Democrats who put New York first and political parties second, even in this age of hyperpartisanship, because we remembered what we were there to do \u2014 which was to serve the public and not serve our political interests. We are the New Yorkers who put aside our differences to find commonality to move this state forward.Now, even with all we have done, our task is far from complete. We have much more to do. We have to rebuild the upstate economy, all across upstate New York, by replicating the successful model that we\u2019ve used in Buffalo. We must address chronic high poverty in this state in many of our urban areas, from the South Bronx to Rochester. We must demand that the value of an hour\u2019s work \u2014 the minimum wage \u2014 is sufficient to mean that you don\u2019t have to choose between paying the rent and putting food on the table. We still lock up too many young people in prisons, at too young an age, at too great a cost. And that has to stop.Women are still too often victims of violence and are still trapped under a glass ceiling and still need a full Women\u2019s Equality Act to give them full equality in this society.We must maintain our fiscal discipline and continue to provide tax relief for struggling families and growing businesses.We must do more for ethics reform to build trust, which is the lifeblood of any government.Our education system, while better than it was, is far from what we need to lead the global economy. We have new and growing challenges we didn\u2019t have before, such as climate change and extreme weather, which have brought New York tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms and floods. Seven feet of snow in Buffalo, more than ever before, that\u2019s saying something. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see locusts next, coming up Broadway. We have new challenges to our public health system, like the Ebola virus. We have new challenges to our public safety system, where 13 years after 9/11 terrorism has metastasized from Africa to Asia, from Hamas to ISIS.These are challenges, to be sure. But the past four years have renewed our confidence and have shown us what we can accomplish when we work together. Remember how far we\u2019ve come. It\u2019s time to be bold, my friends, because there is no small solution to big problems. We can do all this that I\u2019ve mentioned, and we can do more. And we must.Because in many ways the most severe problems we face go beyond the borders of our state, and the challenges are profound. We\u2019ve seen the national unrest and the national discord. The American promise itself is being questioned. The offer of fairness and opportunity that was the American compact is now in doubt.Americans are disheartened, disappointed by the economic climate, and rightly so. We are told the recession is over. We read reports that say the economic numbers are going up, up and up \u2014 but we work harder, and we earn less.Income inequality is at the highest point in over a century. While American capitalism never guaranteed success, it did guarantee opportunity. And too many Americans are questioning the long-held belief that their children\u2019s future will be better than their own. For too many, the dream of economic mobility has been replaced with the nightmare of economic stagnation.For previous generations our education system offered hope. It was the escalator out of poverty. The public education system could take an Italian immigrant\u2019s son from the back of a grocery store in South Jamaica to become the governor of the State of New York. It could take an African-American boy from the Bronx and see him become the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It could take a child of Bedford-Stuyvesant and make that person the C.E.O. of a Fortune 500 bank.But that was yesterday\u2019s public education system. Today, we have two education systems, if we want to tell the truth: one for the rich, and one for the poor. And if you happen to be born in the wrong Zip code and go to a failing school, you will get left behind and never catch up. Public education that was the great equalizer in the society has become in some communities the great discriminator. Today\u2019s high-tech advanced manufacturing economy, demanding lifelong learning, has squeezed the middle class, and people feel left out and left behind. And that\u2019s not all.If the American dream of economic opportunity was a basic component in the compact defining America, than the second component was our justice system. And our justice system ensured the promise of fairness and security for all. Our national symbol of justice, Lady Justice, carries a sword, a set of scales, and she also wears a blindfold. Why? To signify objectivity. Objectivity that one\u2019s wealth, one\u2019s class, one\u2019s race are irrelevant to the pursuit of justice.But today, sadly, too many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact, or does the justice system now see black and white, or black and blue, or rich and poor? The world saw an African-American man in Staten Island die. And people are confused, disappointed and angry. Law-enforcement officials have been wrongfully targeted, and even assassinated. The situation has devolved into one which everyone is talking but no one is listening.It must stop, and it\u2019s time for the truth.The truth is: The justice system does need review. The truth is: There are troubling questions that have been raised that must be answered. The truth is: Police officers do need more safety and need more protection. The truth is: Law enforcement needs to respect the community as much as the community needs to respect law enforcement. The truth is: It is our obligation as leaders to provide the reforms necessary to ensure safety. This is a New York City issue, it is a Buffalo issue, it is a Ferguson issue, a Los Angeles issue, but it is also our responsibility to solve it here, in the State of New York. And that is a challenge that we are up to.Yesterday a young gentleman congratulated me on my re-election, and he said, \u201cYou know, I wish you good luck, governor,\u201d with a sort of sad face. And I said, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to govern in very troubled times.\u201d He told the truth, and he was right. These are troubled times.When Americans questioning our economic system. When they\u2019re questioning whether or not they have economic mobility. When they\u2019re questioning whether or not their children are going to do better. When they\u2019re questioning whether or not the public education system is working for them. When they\u2019re questioning our justice system and whether or not our justice system is fair. They are questioning the essence of everything we believed in. Those are the primary democratic institutions of this country. That was the essential compact we made, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re questioning.And that is the challenge before us: to be fearless enough to admit the truth. To talk about these problems no matter how difficult, because you will never solve a problem you are unwilling to admit. And then we must act, and we must perform, and we must deliver results that answer these questions and right these wrongs and restore confidence in what America is all about and what New York is all about.We can do this. We can create economic opportunity for all. We can raise the minimum wage. We can create good jobs. We can get minority youth the training. We can use job-training credits. We can create the best education system in the world. We can beat the bureaucracy. We can get results. We can make the changes that we need to make. We can get the resources that we need. And we can restore confidence and trust in the justice system, both in perception and in reality.Now you can say: \u201cWell, governor, those are big challenges. Those are big challenges, and I don\u2019t know if we can do it.\u201d Yes they are big challenges, and yes they will be hard to accomplish. But my friends, that is what New Yorkers do. And that is what we have always done. We have always taken on the big challenges \u2014 taken them on first, gotten them done, and then created an example for the rest of the nation.We started with the Erie Canal in 1812. Here in New York City you think New York City made New York City. No, the Erie Canal made New York City. Governor DeWitt Clinton had a dream. The question was who was going to open up access to the West. How could you get goods by water to the West? And Thomas Jefferson and Washington and Virginia were trying to dig a series of canals that would get you to the Mississippi and that would open the West. And that would have made Virginia the main port. And DeWitt Clinton said: \u201cNo, I have a great idea. We\u2019ll use New York. And you can come up the Hudson River and you get to Albany and then you make a left and you go through the state and you come out in Buffalo, and once you\u2019re in Buffalo, you are in the Great Lakes. And then you could go wherever you want to go.\u201d They said: \u201cGovernor, one question, when you make the left at Buffalo \u2014 at Albany \u2014 how do you get to Buffalo?\u201d He said, \u201cNo problem, we\u2019ll dig a canal.\u201d Dig a canal? Five hundred and twenty-four miles. Eighteen-twelve. Built that canal. No hydraulics. Men, women and mules, they dug that Erie Canal. It made New York what it was. They came through New York City to go up the Hudson River to get to the Erie Canal. When DeWitt Clinton started that project, they wanted to impeach him because they thought he lost his mind. Literally. They said it can\u2019t be done. It\u2019s too ambitious. They did it. They did it on time. They did it on budget. It worked. It made New York State what New York State is, and it accelerated the whole development of the United States. That\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s the stock we come from.When they were talking about a dream of women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s suffrage, where did they go? They went to New York. And Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, \u2018Yes, we can do this,\u2019 and it is the New York women who came together and organized and got women the right to vote. When they stood up and said in the \u201960s, gays deserve equal rights, it was us, at Stonewall, who stood up and said, \u2018That\u2019s right, gay people deserve equal rights.\u2019 New York was there first. When a big state had to pass marriage equality because we were discriminating against gay people, and not letting them marry was just another source of discrimination, and you needed a big state to stand up and pass it \u2014 and it was hard \u2014 it was New York that passed marriage equality. And it resonated all across the country.After Sandy Hook, when we saw the massacre and we saw the children killed and we said, \u2018Enough is enough with this lunacy of guns,\u2019 and you needed a state to pass sensible gun control, who did it? The State of New York did it. We did it first. That is who we are, and that\u2019s where we come from.Frederick Douglass once said, \u201cIf there is no struggle, there is no progress.\u201d We know that in New York. Nothing comes easy. None of the ones worth it come easy. If it comes easy, you didn\u2019t need it in the first place. And this is a uniquely New York moment. Because when things are at their worst, New Yorkers are at their best. And to any of those who have a question about our capacity, just look at where we are today: the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. The high point of New York, on the same site as the low point of New York at 9/11. Why? Because that\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what this site says, that\u2019s what this building says: You knock us down, we get up twice as tall. You give us adversity, we turn it into opportunity. You try to divide us, and we come back more unified and tighter than ever before. And that\u2019s what these challenges are asking us to do: to take that great diversity that is New York, and to find the commonality and to come together for the good of New York.And once again, the emphasis is on \u201cwe.\u201d We, as my father said so well, we are the family of New York, he called it, a collection of the most daring, bold, accepting people from every country on the globe. Every color, every creed is here in New York. Gay and straight, upstate and downstate, working together to make our diversity a source of strength and not of weakness, and to find our commonality, all for the same mutual goal of making New York a better state.We will do this, and we will lead the nation by our example once again, because this is New York, and we are New Yorkers, and this is what we do.E.\u2009B. White said, New York is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village. The visible symbol of aspiration and faith. The white plumes saying the way is up. That is New York. The symbol forward. The symbol that shows us the direction that is up.Thank you, and God bless you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Envoy Urges Thailand to Lift Martial Law", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe envoy, Daniel R. Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said in an interview that he had been sent by the Obama administration to tell the military leaders that the United States would not \u201cpaper over problems\u201d and that he had told the junta it was losing credibility.The United States was critical of the coup in May, but it has also sought to preserve the essentials of its relationship with Thailand, one of its oldest allies in Asia, including a longstanding military association.Mr. Russel\u2019s message to the junta on Monday, which he described as \u201cblunt\u201d and \u201ctough,\u201d was Washington\u2019s most detailed criticism of the overthrowing of the country\u2019s elected government and the curtailment of civil rights and speech that followed.\u201cThailand is losing credibility in the eyes of its international friends and partners by not moving more quickly to end martial law, to restore civil rights and to ensure that this effort to engineer a new constitution and hold elections is not purely a top-down affair,\u201d Mr. Russel said.The retroactive impeachment of Ms. Yingluck on Friday and the announcement that she would be charged with criminal negligence over a signature agricultural policy have been interpreted as a hardening of the military\u2019s stance against her movement, which has won every election since 2001 but is deeply resented by the Bangkok elite.Ms. Yingluck was warned by the military that she would be detained if she held a news conference on Friday after the impeachment vote, according to a statement posted by her lawyer on Facebook.The Thai Foreign Ministry issued a statement late Monday hailing \u201ca long relationship\u201d of more than 180 years with the United States and said it had advised Mr. Russel of the government\u2019s \u201creform procedures.\u201dIn the interview late Monday, Mr. Russel also appeared to warn the Thai government that it would probably retain its \u201cTier 3\u201d status, the lowest ranking in the State Department\u2019s annual assessment of how countries handle the issue of human trafficking.\u201cUnless there is real, measurable results to point to, I don\u2019t know how you can say that the situation has gotten better yet,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Local Taxes Hit Lower Wage Earners Harder ", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to the taxes closest to home, the less you earn, the harder you\u2019re hit.According to the study, in 2015 the poorest fifth of Americans will pay on average 10.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes, the middle fifth will pay 9.4 percent and the top 1 percent will average 5.4 percent.\u201cVirtually every state\u2019s tax system is fundamentally unfair,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cUnfair tax systems not only exacerbate widening income inequality in the short term, but they also will leave states struggling to raise enough revenue to meet their basic needs in the long term.\u201dThe trend is growing worse, said Meg Wiehe, state policy director at the institute, a nonpartisan research organization based in the nation\u2019s capital. Several states have adopted or are considering policy changes that further lighten the tax load on their wealthiest residents, she said.States and localities have regressive systems because they tend to rely more on sales and excise taxes (fees tacked onto items like gas, liquor and cigarettes), which are the same rate for rich and poor alike. Even property taxes, which account for much of local tax revenue, hit working- and middle-class families harder than the wealthy because their homes often represent their largest asset.The federal income tax system, by contrast, primarily taxes individuals at a graduated rate, and those who earn more pay a larger share. (The federal system also uses payroll taxes to raise large sums for Social Security and Medicare, dipping into the pockets of many low- and moderate-income Americans who pay little, if any, income tax.)In the institute\u2019s \u201cTerrible 10\u201d states, the bottom 20 percent of earners pay up to seven times as much of their income in taxes as the top 1 percenters, the report says. These include Washington, where the poorest residents pay 16.8 percent of their income in taxes while the wealthiest sliver pays just 2.4 percent, followed by Florida, Texas, South Dakota, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Kansas and Indiana.Judgments about what makes a tax system fair, of course, vary widely. For the institute, fairness is equated with progressivity. Some conservatives dispute that definition, however, and argue that lowering tax rates on business and the wealthy promotes economic growth, which in the long run lifts everyone\u2019s fortunes. That was the idea behind the tax revolution in Kansas ushered in by the Republican governor, Sam Brownback, in 2012. He reduced personal income tax rates while eliminating income taxes altogether for 190,000 businesses.Despite a crippling budget shortfall, Governor Brownback has continued to defend his approach. \u201cIt takes time for it to work,\u201d he said last month.The institute rejects such arguments, saying that these sorts of \u201ctrickle-down economic theories\u201d have long been discredited. It also dismissed boasts by some states like Washington and Texas that taxes were low for everyone because they lacked an income tax. \u201cThese states\u2019 disproportionate reliance on sales and excise taxes make their taxes among the highest in the entire nation on low-income families,\u201d the report said.Others have come to similar conclusions.\u201cLet\u2019s not try to guess what is fair and what is not,\u201d Odysseas Papadimitriou, the chief executive of WalletHub, explained, \u201cLet\u2019s ask Americans.\u201d\u201cWe were surprised to find both liberals and conservatives believe that the most fair system is a progressive one \u2014 taxing the poor less than the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cThey disagreed how much, but they agreed that it should be progressive.\u201dWalletHub ended up doing three rankings: a liberal, a conservative and an overall rating. On all three, Washington came in last and Montana, which does not rely much on sales and excise taxes, ranked at the top.The institute included Montana in its list of the fairest states along with Delaware, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont and the District of Columbia, which is the only system that taxes the poorest 20 percent less than the top 1 percent. On a scale of how much each state\u2019s tax system contributes to income inequality, New York is 39th and New Jersey is 41st.The higher-ranked states generally have progressive income taxes or supplement the federal earned-income tax credit program for low- and moderate-income households with their own refundable credits that can help offset sales and property taxes, reducing the overall tax bill for those eligible. By contrast, breaks that tend to favor richer residents, like being able to deduct for home mortgage interest and reduce the cost of capital gains taxes, shift more of the tax burden to lower wage earners.Still, \u201ceven these least regressive states fail to meet what most people would consider minimal standards of tax fairness,\u201d the report concluded, because \u201cat least some low- or middle-income groups pay more of their income in state and local taxes than wealthy families.\u201d\u201cThrough a progressive tax structure, it\u2019s possible to counteract much of the depressing effect inequality has on tax revenue growth rates,\u201d the S.&P. report said.Progressive income taxes, which require the rich to pay a higher proportion of their income than the poor, have come under attack from conservative advocates and policy makers.Some states have moved away from a progressive system. North Carolina, for example, replaced its graduated income tax with a flat tax and increased the sales tax on electricity in 2013. That same year, Ohio reduced personal income tax rates across the board and raised the sales tax. And Kansas, in addition to reducing its income tax, increased its sales tax.New Republican governors as well as Republican majorities in several statehouses across the country have promised to continue the trend and cut personal income tax rates in addition to corporate rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s New Left-Wing Cabinet Signals Willingness to Confront E.U. Over Policies", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wished Mr. Tsipras \u201cmuch strength and success,\u201d if also noting that \u201cyou are taking office in a difficult time in which you face great responsibility.\u201dMr. Tsipras quickly demonstrated that Europe must not treat Greece as a weak junior partner. His government on Tuesday denounced a European Council statement in which European leaders blamed Russia for the escalating violence in Ukraine and raised the prospect of new economic sanctions.In its own statement, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s office said the European statement had been issued \u201cwithout the consent of Greece.\u201d The prime minister also complained by telephone to Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief.Mr. Tsipras has been a sharp critic of European sanctions against Moscow and has displayed past good will toward Russia, a sentiment common among many Greeks.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sent Mr. Tsipras a congratulatory telegram on Monday, the day he was sworn into office, while that same day, Mr. Tsipras met with the Russian ambassador in Athens.Having a Greek prime minister with a strongly dissenting view on Russian sanctions could greatly complicate European Union foreign policy, which has benefited from a German-led unanimity among heads of state on confronting Mr. Putin.Further sanctions cannot be approved without a unanimous vote from the leaders of European Union member nations, and Mr. Tsipras might find sympathetic partners in countries like Hungary or Slovakia, which dislike sanctions but generally go along.Political analysts in Athens interpreted Mr. Tsipras\u2019s early warning shots as clever political positioning, given that his government will soon open negotiations with the country\u2019s European creditors over the punishing bailout provisions. Showing that he could complicate European goals in Ukraine may give him leverage in his economic negotiations, analysts said.\u201cHe\u2019s maneuvering all the time,\u201d said Stelios Kouloglou, a political commentator who last year ran an unsuccessful campaign with Syriza for the European Parliament. \u201cBut he has a main direction.\u201dThat direction is forcing Europe to ease the bailout\u2019s tough, belt-tightening conditions, which have crippled the Greek economy and contributed to rampant joblessness, foreclosures and shuttered businesses.Political opponents have warned that Syriza\u2019s leftist roots would infuse Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government with a populist, radical agenda.Costas Karagounis, a spokesman for New Democracy, the defeated conservative party, warned that some cabinet members had \u201cexpressed dangerous views\u201d on economic growth and privatization.But the broader public reaction to the new government seemed to be one of elation, if also concern about the future.Mr. Tsipras worked assiduously in the weeks before Sunday\u2019s elections to reassure Greek voters that he was not a wild-eyed radical but would defend Greek interests and reverse the most punitive aspects of the bailout conditions.\u201cSyriza is a new reality in a new Europe,\u201d said Panagiotis Kouroumplis, the country\u2019s new health minister, in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disintegrate Europe. We believe there will be voices who will listen to Syriza.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhat is most frustrating to citizens is they see wealth being created in Europe, but that wealth is being distributed to just a few, instead of equally.\u201dMr. Kouloglou, the political analyst, predicted that the new government would steadily target the oligarchical businesses that have dominated the Greek economy and enjoyed close political ties to past governments \u2014 and which actively opposed Mr. Tsipras\u2019s campaign.\u201cHe has no reason to pay them back or to make a compromise,\u201d Mr. Kouloglou said. \u201cHe was not given a gift, and he is not obliged to give a gift back.\u201dIn assembling the new cabinet, Mr. Tsipras streamlined the number of ministries, but he did create a new one to fight corruption, led by the former head of Greece\u2019s anti-money-laundering authority.He also gave the job of defense minister to Panos Kammenos, the leader of the small, center-right party Independent Greeks, with which Syriza formed a coalition to achieve a parliamentary majority.Even as many Greek leftists winced at Mr. Kammenos\u2019s holding such a prominent position, some analysts saw the move as further evidence that Mr. Tsipras was more a dealmaker than a leftist ideologue, and that his party\u2019s primary focus would be the formidable tasks of confronting Europe over the bailout and reviving the Greek economy.\u201cToday, Syriza is not a left-wing party,\u201d said Mr. Kouroumplis, the health minister. \u201cIt is, first of all, a patriotic party, which believes in peace, democracy and social justice. We demand the right to live in dignity.\u201dOf Greece\u2019s creditors, he added, \u201cThey should know that they are dealing with proud people.\u201dDimitris Bounias and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Party Harnesses Discontent in Greece", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byILION, Greece \u2014 Harry Theoharis, whose relentless efforts as head of Greece\u2019s tax collection agency prompted one newspaper last year to nickname him Little Stalin, was out campaigning recently in a smoky cafe in this working-class suburb of Athens.Some of the pensioners there ignored him. Others openly asked how Mr. Theoharis, 44, who was reportedly forced to resign over his zealousness in addressing Greece\u2019s chronic tax-avoidance problems, had the nerve to come asking for votes. But Mr. Theoharis, who is now running as a member of a new political party, To Potami, charged on, arguing with good humor that efficient tax collection led to lower taxes.\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing out his leaflets. \u201cThis is the first piece of paper you have gotten from me that does not have a bill attached.\u201dWhether or not Mr. Theoharis will win a parliamentary seat in Sunday\u2019s general election is an open question. But his party, founded just last March by a journalist and largely made up of candidates who, like him, have never run for office before, is, to the surprise of many, running third in the polls.To Potami could end up being the kingmaker if neither of the two leaders in the field \u2014 Alexis Tsipras\u2019s left-wing Syriza party, which is leading in the polls, or Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s center-right New Democracy, which is several percentage points behind \u2014 gets a clear majority.For Mr. Tsipras in particular, an alliance with To Potami, which has cast itself as the party of moderation and preached the need to stay in the eurozone at all costs, could be politically useful. It could help soothe the fears of creditors and financial markets that have been unnerved by earlier statements from Mr. Tsipras about renegotiating Greece\u2019s bailout agreements. And it could provide him political cover should he need to shift away from the more radical demands of the far left wing of his party and compromise with the so-called troika that has imposed strict conditions on Greece for the last five years: the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Experts say that the many small parties \u2014 three of them have emerged since the crisis \u2014 are in part a measure of the collapse of the traditional center-left party, Pasok, which was led by Mr. Papandreou, won 44 percent of the vote in 2009 before the depth of the crisis became clear, and now polls at about 5 percent. But the center right is losing support to smaller parties, too, experts say, because many Greeks no longer want to see a single party with a clear majority in Parliament, free to do as it pleases.Mr. Malkoutzis said he also saw a growing discomfort with the two main choices before Greek voters, and the conduct of their leaders.Mr. Samaras has concentrated on dispensing a message of fear. One of his latest commercials offers a frightening possibility should Mr. Tsipras win. The ad says that negotiations between Mr. Tsipras and the country\u2019s creditors would break down and the country\u2019s funding would be cut off, and that soon the elderly would lose their pensions and the country would suffer shortages of fuel and medicine.Mr. Tsipras, on the other hand, talks every day about the ways in which he would challenge the austerity measures imposed on Greece by its creditors.Though polling at around 7 percent, To Potami, which means The River, does not yet even have a clear program, except that it is pro-Europe and pro-stability. On Monday, at the opening of a new campaign headquarters in Glyfada, a middle-class suburb of Athens, the leader of To Potami, Stavros Theodorakis, told a crowd that he had experts working on a proposal for how to renegotiate Greece\u2019s huge debt. Though only six days remained before the election, no one in the crowd seemed much bothered by the lack of specifics.Nikolas Kriparakos, 23, an optician about to start his required military service, who had come to hear Mr. Theodorakis speak, said he liked the new image that the party projected, with so many candidates who were not longtime politicians.\u201cIt is not something old,\u201d he said of the party. \u201cAnd having more than one party expressing opinions is a good idea, I think.\u201dIf Mr. Tsipras should win but fall shy of a majority, he will have no shortage of parties that have expressed interest in teaming up with him, most of them polling from 3 to 7 percent. Even Evangelos Venizelos, the leader of Pasok, which right now is in a coalition with Mr. Samaras, has said he is ready to change course and \u201ccooperate\u201d with Mr. Tsipras. Mr. Papandreou has said that his new party will also be willing to partner under certain conditions.In addition, the Independent Greeks, a right-wing party created not long before the 2012 elections that also argues against austerity, has said it is available to partner with Mr. Tsipras.The open question is what kind of concessions, if any, Mr. Tsipras would be willing to make to gain the support of various parties. He has said he wants to team up with the Communists, but they have loudly proclaimed that they want nothing to do with him and have campaigned actively against him.He has also said that he will not team up with To Potami, Pasok and Mr. Papandreou\u2019s new party, the Movement of Democratic Socialists, though some experts say that he might change his mind. In any case, the front-runner in the election will have three days to try to form a government if there is no outright majority. After that, the second-place party gets its chance.Pollsters say that To Potami has impressed voters because of candidates like Mr. Theoharis, who was once labeled a technological whiz kid and who managed to computerize Greece\u2019s tax filing system before falling out with his bosses.Mr. Theoharis had been hired for a five-year term that was supposed to protect him from political pressure. But after 20 months, he left office. The Finance Ministry issued a statement at the time saying only that he had left for personal reasons. But on the campaign trail, he says that he left because he could no longer fend off political pressure to play favorites.\u201cWhen they sent me their friends,\u201d he told the men in the cafe, \u201cI said no.\u201dElias Nikolakopoulos, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of Athens, said that recent polls showed 15 to 20 percent of the population was still undecided and that surprises were possible. Since the crisis began, he said, political affiliations have been far more unpredictable.In the May 2012 vote, he said, \u201cexit polls found that 40 percent had made up their minds in the last two weeks.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It has also blurred the boundaries between art and political activism, challenging the state\u2019s control over cultural spaces. \u201cIn a sense it was a test,\u201d Ms. Bruguera said of her bid to stage the work, \u201cTatlin\u2019s Whisper #6,\u201d in which Cubans would express their desires for the country\u2019s future.Speaking by telephone from Havana this week, she said of Cuban authorities, \u201cNow I see they would never have allowed it.\u201dCuba is, in some respects, like a giant schoolyard, where some citizens try to push the envelope as much as possible without paternalistic authorities clamping down. Visual artists, writers, filmmakers, theater directors and musicians are constantly nudging the changeable line between what can and cannot be said. Every few months, it seems, one crosses the line and is chastised.Notwithstanding the showdown over \u201cTatlin\u2019s Whisper,\u201d the space for expression has grown significantly since the early days of the revolution, when Fidel Castro said: \u201cWhat are the rights of writers and artists, revolutionary or not revolutionary? Within the revolution, everything; against the revolution, no right.\u201dPresident Ra\u00fal Castro is more open to debate than his older brother, Fidel. And even the extremely limited Internet access in Cuba has made it hard for the government to control all areas of media and culture. Many Cubans surreptitiously receive satellite television signals from the United States and pass movies, music and articles around on devices. A community of bloggers has emerged, some highly critical. \u201cYou never know how far you can go,\u201d said Leonardo Padura, a well-known Cuban novelist, whose popular detective novels are a blistering study of the hardships and shady dealings of daily life in Cuba. He added, \u201cSometimes it seems as if spaces open and then close again.\u201dFor some who cross the limits, punishment can be harsh. Danilo Maldonado Machado, a graffiti artist known as El Sexto, has been in police detention since Dec. 25, when he tried to transport two pigs whose flanks were emblazoned with the names Fidel and Ra\u00fal that he intended to use in a performance.Censorship is, at times, as much about where a work is shown as the work itself. The state-run National Council of Visual Arts suggested that Mr. Oliva first put on his \u201cUtopias y Disidencias\u201d show, a series of vignettes about a Candide-like Cuban, in Havana, perhaps because the capital is more open-minded or because officials there bear him no personal grudge; he refused. Enrique Del Risco, a Cuban academic who lectures at the Spanish department of New York University, said that what troubled authorities most about Ms. Bruguera\u2019s open-mike performance was probably not what Cubans might have said there but that they would have said it on hallowed ground, a vast square that is used for political rallies and overlooked by murals of revolutionary heroes.Ms. Bruguera was arrested before the performance could take place, as were dozens of people who went to Revolution Square to take part. The artist, who has since been detained and released two more times, has had her passport confiscated and says that authorities offered to return it if she promised not to return to Cuba.In an interview published in La Jiribilla, a state-run cultural newspaper, Rub\u00e9n del Valle Lantar\u00f3n, president of the National Council of Visual Arts, said that he had offered Ms. Bruguera alternative spaces, such as a factory, universities, a bus stop or a fruit market \u2014 options that he said she turned down. Ms. Bruguera said she rejected places where officials could restrict participation and suggested, as an alternative to Revolution Square, a small square in Old Havana. Officials refused, she said.Mr. del Valle described Ms. Bruguera\u2019s performance as a \u201creality show\u201d undertaken \u201cunder a lot of external pressures\u201d from anti-Castro exiles \u2014 a charge Ms. Bruguera dismissed. The debate exposed the complex dynamics within a sphere whose artists preserve a delicate entente with cultural authorities. These artists sometimes resent gestures they see as grandstanding, especially from Cubans or others who do not live in the country.Ms. Bruguera defended the timing of the piece and her right to protest, as a Cuban.The piece was \u201cpolitical timing specific,\u201d she added, in that it worked in a particular political moment.\u201cEverything that happened \u2014 from the day that we formed the platform, is a performance,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it turned out different from what I expected.\u201dMr. Del Risco, the Cuban academic, said Ms. Bruguera\u2019s participatory work, which plays with the barriers between art and reality, challenged the Cuban government\u2019s predilection for well-defined space.\u201cWhat Tania did is to break a hole between two spaces that are supposed to be kept separate \u2014 art and reality, art and the people, art and politics,\u201d Mr. Del Risco said.He hopes American officials will continue to press for freedoms as they negotiate new diplomatic and economic relations. \u201cThe United States has too much faith in the power of the economy and of tourism to bring political change,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because the two countries have contact, I don\u2019t think there will be some magical opening.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Stately Old Charleston, the New Buildings on the Block Are Struggling to Fit In ", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 The elegant buildings from different eras strut across Charleston\u2019s downtown neighborhoods like notes on a major scale: the Gothic churches, the Greek Revival storefronts, the homes in vivid pastels exuding Queen Anne grace, Georgian symmetry and Italianate grandeur.But these are days of bum notes and dissonance in historic Charleston, which is enjoying a robust economy and one of the most transformative regional population booms since the Civil War. Long accustomed to basing its reputation on the grandeur of its old buildings, the city now finds it almost impossible to agree on how to build new ones.In recent months, traditionalists have blocked efforts to introduce contemporary architecture in the historic core, which was the first in the nation to be covered by a preservation ordinance. Modernists are rolling their eyes at new buildings that copy traditional styles, arguing that they pervert a record of architectural progress long documented in mortar and stone.And both sides agree that many of the buildings approved by the city\u2019s Board of Architectural Review in recent years have been duds that tried, and failed, to have it both ways.\u201cWell, they\u2019re just not beautiful,\u201d Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., said of the new buildings in an interview at Charleston City Hall, which was completed in 1804 and is attributed to a local architect, Gabriel Manigault. \u201cThe materials, the execution \u2014 you don\u2019t feel excellence there. They\u2019re not special. You don\u2019t walk by and say, \u2018I\u2019m glad that got built.\u2019\u201dSuch problems may seem trivial to the Detroits of the world, and reflect more universal tensions in the realms of architecture and historic preservation. But they are particularly acute in Charleston, where new arrivals and a diverse economy threaten to transform a merely beautiful metropolis into an economically important one.At the same time, the essential $2.8 billion tourism sector lives or dies on the city\u2019s ability to remain charming.\u201cCharleston is a city that looks back, and rarely does the city look forward, because so much of what the city is, is steeped in what it has been,\u201d said Ray Huff, director of the Clemson Architecture Center here.But with the new growth pressure, Mr. Huff said, \u201cWe can\u2019t be the slow-paced, sleepy town that I grew up in anymore.\u201dNo one is more aware of these realities than Mayor Riley, a slight, formal, bespectacled man who, in his nearly 40 years in office, has established himself as something of an aesthete-in-chief. Many here credit the mayor with wisely shepherding Charleston through its recent renaissance with an emphasis on the importance of shared public spaces.In conversation, he is prone to speaking in the language of design, criticizing as extraneous the light-blocking louvers of one downtown building, while praising the \u201cvoid-to-solid ratio\u201d of another.\u201cThe question really is, how does a building enhance the city?\u201d the mayor said. \u201cHow does it enhance the street?\u201dCharleston is a city of 128,000 people, but locals are quick to note that it was the fourth-largest port city in the Colonies in 1770, and many of its finest 18th- and 19th-century buildings were built with money from the trade of indigo, rice and slaves.That sense of self-importance did not waver as other cities surpassed it. Indeed, it may have been bolstered after Charleston emerged from the 20th-century era of urban renewal with its historic core largely intact. The historic downtown neighborhoods have been further burnished by waves of wealthy newcomers who have lovingly restored many old homes \u2014 while sending real estate prices soaring.Beyond the center, greater Charleston has its share of unremarkable suburban development. But aesthetics and the built environment remain central to the civic conversation.On a recent afternoon, Robert Behre, the architecture columnist for The Post and Courier of Charleston, drove through downtown, pointing out newish anonymous buildings that could have been built in Atlanta or Orange County, Calif., the ungainly new government buildings, and the dull boxes dressed up with the occasional row of columns.\u201cIt\u2019s not blatantly bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of meh.\u201dNew buildings proposed for the historic district must be approved by the Board of Architectural Review, but it does not dictate a specific architectural style. Critics of newer buildings offer a range of theories as to why they fail to impress, from the need to build in hurricane- and earthquake-resistant features that eat up construction budgets, to the suspicion that builders prefer to submit the designs that are least likely to provoke or offend.\u201cThat\u2019s what gives me great pause in a city like Charleston, because the city is so diverse, and presents so many eras and fashions,\u201d said Whitney Powers, a local architect.The city, meanwhile, is nearing completion of a $142 million renovation of an auditorium and office building called the Gaillard Center that is heavy on limestone and neo-Classical columns.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful, cherished and loved 100 years from now,\u201d Mayor Riley said.For the Gaillard, Mr. Burgess had nothing but praise. Even if it eventually goes to seed, he said, \u201cIt\u2019ll look like a beautiful ruin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Greeks Head to the Polls, Many Saying \u2018Enough\u2019", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverATHENS \u2014 Driving along a broad avenue lined with restaurants, the Greek man at the wheel points to the trash cans. Every night, he says, people rummage through them for scraps of food. His two well-educated daughters cannot find jobs; more than half of Greek youths have no work, and the jobs that do appear are often short-term and lacking in benefits.Such stories of misery are legion after six years of economic crisis \u2014 including stories of suicides, of housewives turning to prostitution. Listening to them, the only surprise in the rise of the left-wing Syriza party, which is expected to come in first in Sunday\u2019s general election, is that it has taken so long for an anti-austerity party to come to the fore.Alexis Tsipras, Syriza\u2019s charismatic 40-year-old leader, has been campaigning under the banner \u201cHope is on its way.\u201d He has vowed to undo the austerity program mandated by the troika of international creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 and at the same time to somehow reduce the country\u2019s debt and remain in the eurozone. Fulfilling these contradictory promises may not be possible, but to a lot of people that\u2019s not the point \u2014 voting for Syriza is another way of saying \u201cEnough.\u201dThe incumbent prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has insisted that the radical left wants to drive Greece out of the euro, and that the only path for Greece is to stay the course of painful reforms and budget cuts that he has led.Recent opinion polls showed Mr. Samaras\u2019s center-right New Democracy party only four to six percentage points behind Syriza. So even if Syriza does come in first, it will probably need a coalition to form a government. Given the variety of parties and passions likely to come out of the elections, the next government may not be around for long.All this makes for a frightening welter of unknowns as voters approach decision time. If Mr. Tsipras goes ahead with his promise to cut taxes and restore social spending without finding new sources of funding, the \u201ctroika\u201d bailout could be cut short. Without the bailout, Greece would face the risk of a default on its massive sovereign debt. And failing to meet its debts would raise the possibility of a \u201cGrexit,\u201d a Greek exit from the eurozone.Though Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has the decisive say in what demands to make of Greece, insists she wants Greece to remain in the eurozone, the possibility of a Greek exit is no longer regarded in Berlin and Brussels as necessarily an unmitigated disaster. For the Greeks, however, it would be, most likely plunging the country into recession, and the large majority of Greeks want the country to remain in the single currency.In any case, Mr. Tsipras has given signals that he may be open to a more sensible course than his radical party platform. Polls show that a strong majority of Greeks, 61 percent, want consensus in talks with the troika, and the optimistic scenario is that his left-wing credentials would give him the credibility to urge more patience. Another question is whether Berlin and Brussels really mean their tough talk about Greece. Mrs. Merkel repeated in her keynote speech at Davos that Greece must accept responsibility for its mountain of debt. But there seems to be a growing sentiment among economists in Europe that debt relief is essential to bringing the Greek economy back from the depths. Whether Greeks \u201cdeserve\u201d punishing austerity after years of profligacy, as many in northern Europe continue to maintain, is not the right question. The question is how to allow Greece to move forward and to avoid a political catastrophe that would inevitably have ramifications for the rest of Europe.Mr. Tsipras or whoever wins Sunday\u2019s election must understand that there is no easy, painless exit out of Greece\u2019s troubles. But Germany and the troika must understand that sticking with their flawed and dogmatic insistence on austerity can only create more misery and desperation \u2014 and a more radical response next time.

If that plan survives expected political and legal challenges, it may require extensive revamping of electricity markets that are largely regulated by the states.In an interview, Mr. Heising said that state governments needed to seize the moment to take full advantage of the coming possibilities for cleaning up the grid \u2014 and, at the same time, to avoid undermining the economics of the utilities that Americans depend on for a reliable supply of electricity.\u201cThe utility businesses are being heavily disrupted,\u201d Mr. Heising said. \u201cThat\u2019s creating some real stress for the utilities and their revenue model. It needs to be addressed in a fair and comprehensive way.\u201dAmerican states are generally behind Europe in the rollout of renewable power. Experts say that gives them time \u2014 a few years, at most \u2014 to get ahead of the coming changes. In several states, utilities have begun to sense the coming threat and are trying to roll back existing state rules that favor solar and wind power, though environmentalists are fighting back and the utilities have had only modest success so far.Thus, even some of the states that intend to challenge Mr. Obama\u2019s plan in court are expected to hedge their bets by coming up with a backup strategy.The $48 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Heising-Simons family will not go directly to state governments. Instead, the money will fund groups that can help the states with their planning.In an interview, Mr. Ritter said his group was working with both Republican- and Democratic-led states to scrutinize the Obama administration\u2019s plans, as well as to weigh the broader issues. A crucial priority for the states will be keeping electricity costs reasonable, Mr. Ritter said.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to argue that there\u2019s economic benefit to states that make the transition to a clean-energy economy,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. \u201cHow do you do it so it\u2019s not on the back of ratepayers who are middle- and lower-income?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Republican Ruse to Make Tax Cuts Look Good", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLOS ANGELES \u2014 AS Republicans take control of Congress this month, at the top of their to-do list is changing how the government measures the impact of tax cuts on federal revenue: namely, to switch from so-called static scoring to \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring. While seemingly arcane, the change could have significant, negative consequences for enacting sustainable, long-term fiscal policies. Whenever new tax legislation is proposed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u201cscores\u201d it, to estimate whether the bill would raise more or less revenue than existing law would. In preparing estimates, scorekeepers try to predict how people will respond to a new tax law. For example, if Congress contemplates raising the excise tax on cigarettes, scorekeepers consider existing trends in cigarette consumption, the likelihood that the higher taxes will induce some smokers to quit, and the prospect that higher prices will increase incentives for cigarette smuggling. There are no truly \u201cstatic\u201d revenue estimates.These conventional estimates do not, however, include any indirect feedback effects that tax law changes might have on overall national income. In other words, they do not incorporate macroeconomic behavioral changes.Dynamic scoring does. Proponents point out, correctly, that if a tax proposal is large enough, then those sorts of feedback effects can aim the entire economy on a slightly different path. Such proponents argue that conventional projections are skewed against tax cuts, because they do not consider that cutting taxes could lead to higher economic output, which would make up at least some of the lost revenues. They maintain that dynamic scoring will, therefore, be both more neutral and more accurate than current methodologies. But the reality is more complex. In order to look at the effects across the entire economy, dynamic modeling relies on many simplifying assumptions, like how well people can predict the future or how much they care about their children\u2019s future consumption versus their own. Economists disagree on the answers, and different models\u2019 predicted feedback effects vary wildly, depending on the values selected for those uncertain assumptions. The resulting estimates are likely to incorporate greater uncertainty about the magnitude of any revenue-estimating errors and greater exposure to the risk of a political thumb on the scale.Consider the nonpartisan scorekeepers\u2019 estimates of the consequences of a tax-reform bill proposed last year by Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan. Using different models and plausible inputs, the scorekeepers estimated that, under the bill, total gross domestic product might rise between 0.1 percent and 1.6 percent over the next decade \u2014 a 16-fold spread in projected outcomes. Which result should be the basis of congressional scorekeeping? But the bigger problems lie deeper. Federal deficits are on an unsustainable path (as it happens, because of undertaxation, not excessive spending). Simply cutting taxes against the headwind of structural deficits leads to lower growth, as government borrowing soaks up an ever-increasing share of savings.The most optimistic dynamic models get around this by assuming that the world today is in fiscal equilibrium, where the deficit does not grow continuously as a percentage of gross domestic product. But that\u2019s not true. If you add the reality of spiraling deficits into those models, they don\u2019t work.To make these models work, scorekeepers must arbitrarily assume either that we tax more and spend less today than is really the case \u2014 which is what they did for the Camp bill \u2014 or assume that a tax cut today will be followed by a spending cut or tax increase tomorrow. Economists describe such a move as \u201cmaking counterfactual assumptions\u201d; the rest of us call it \u201cmaking stuff up.\u201d In practice, these models are political statements. They show the biggest economic effects by assuming that tax cuts are financed by unspecified future spending cuts. The smaller size of government, not the tax cuts by themselves, largely drives the models\u2019 results. Further, the models are not a step toward more neutral revenue estimates, because they assume that, while individuals make productive investments, government does not. In reality, government spending contributes significantly to economic output. Truly dynamic modeling would weigh the forgone economic returns of government investments against the economic gains from lower taxes. The Republicans\u2019 interest in dynamic scoring is not the result of a million-economist march on Washington; it comes from political factions convinced that tax cuts are the panacea for all economic ills. They will use dynamic scoring to justify a tax cut that, under conventional scorekeeping, loses revenue. When revenues do in fact decline and deficits rise, those same proponents will push for steep cuts in government insurance or investment programs, because they will claim that the models demand it. That is what lies inside the Trojan horse of dynamic scoring.Edward D.

{"Headline": "To a Gamer, Minimalism Is a Virtue", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s Notebook\u201cthe fire is roaring\u201d \u2014 so states the mobile game I\u2019ve been obsessed with lately, the one with barely any graphics, but with the hint of some very bad things to come. I recently paid 99 cents for A Dark Room, which was first released for cellphones about a year ago, and have played it, my phone tells me, for 262 minutes. I initially mistook it for a mindless diversion, one meant to please me, not peck at my conscience. Instead, I discovered one of the rarest things in the brash, frenetic medium of video games: a quiet, minimalist production that says more by saying less. It\u2019s refreshing. With any luck, it\u2019ll inspire more games to shut up. Video games are usually loud, flashy and obvious. Characters chatter about who they are. Little cellphone games uncork loud celebrations when you reach new levels. They overexplain and leave little to mystery. But A Dark Room feels like an obscure poem, one that makes you work to figure out the game. It\u2019s all understatement, blooming slowly without visual flourish or aural onslaught. At its start, A Dark Room is, strangely, little more than a black screen with an adding machine and some vague, uncapitalized phrases: \u201cthe fire is dead. the room is cold. awake. head throbbing. vision blurry. the room is freezing.\u201d A blue line cuts across the top of the screen. The words above it are \u201clight fire.\u201d Tap it, and the screen brightens white. We\u2019re told that a stranger, an unnamed woman, is in a corner of the room.The woman will build things for you: huts that attract villagers; traps that catch animals; tanneries that make leather from killed beasts. Inventory is kept, and the screen becomes a list of words and numbers. You can tap little squares that contain plus and minus symbols to assign villagers to tasks. Each job is part of an economy that will generate more wood, leather, fur. You can play the game just by watching the numbers tick up \u2014 more wood, more game, a new hut or trading post. But for A Dark Room, that appeal is just a setup for something uglier. As I played, I attracted 20 people to my mysterious village. They regularly collected wood. Soon, the game showed these words: \u201cmake them work. day and night.\u201d Then it showed this phrase: \u201cthey are slaves.\u201d The moment\u2019s power is in its quiet surprise. Have we been playing a game about slavery? Are we slave masters? Did we make this happen? Can we undo it?It seems you can\u2019t, not the first time around. But it\u2019s hard to stop playing this game, even as your actions are part of something evil. After that first slavery moment, A Dark Room transforms. The poetrylike phrases become a little more like prose. And the game begins to display primitive graphics: a map entirely illustrated by capital letters, punctuation marks and typographical symbols. Now the player can explore, fight or just stare and try to figure out what a C or an I is, ponder why an O can be turned into a P and slowly deduce what a #### represents. The map invites the pleasures of decoding. The search for meaning is irresistible. Clarity about our identity and true role in this virtual world comes slowly and only in hints. The action of the game is distracting, as often happens. But then we visit a ruined city. \u201cnothing but downcast eyes,\u201d the game reports. \u201cthe people here were broken a long time ago.\u201d And you\u2019ll wonder again, before the game transforms one last time: Did I do that? Was it me? Refreshingly, we have a video game that doesn\u2019t answer our questions. In the months since its release, the creators, Michael Townsend and Amir Rajan, have separately released new games, Gridland and The Ensign. Good news: both enchanting games also underexplain.Stephen Totilo is the editor in chief of the video game site Kotaku.com. Advertisement"}

In addition to Syriza\u2019s threat to go after all-inclusive deals \u2014 Mr. Tsipras has said the business model \u201clargely alienates tourism from the local economy\u201d \u2014 the party has said it will reopen big privatization deals already agreed upon. That could include deals to sell public land to resort developers and a plan to privatize 14 small but crucial airports that serve Greek cities and islands.Hoteliers are alarmed, after a record year had them feeling optimistic again.Tourism plummeted in the depths of the financial crisis, but rebounded by 20 percent last year with a record 21.5 million arrivals. Cruise ship arrivals brought in an additional 2.5 million tourists. Syriza\u2019s plan to go after all-inclusive deals has particularly raised eyebrows, since they accounted for about $2.3 billion of the industry\u2019s projected $17.6 billion in revenue last year, and are offered by competing tourist destinations in Italy, Turkey and Egypt.\u201cWhy not be the California or Florida of Europe?\u201d said Andreas Andreadis, the president of the Greek Tourism Confederation, who wants to do more to make the country a vacation destination and even a place for second homes. Politicians, he added, \u201cthink three months down the road. No vision. Without vision, you are dead.\u201dReferring to the proposed tax increase, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s completely stupid in an exported product where you compete with all the world.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s committing suicide, basically.\u201dOf Syriza\u2019s proposals, such as opening up state privatization deals, he said that \u201cof course everybody is worried,\u201d but added that he believed from his discussions with party members that the proposals had room to evolve.\u201cThese are just ideas; nothing is written in stone,\u201d he said.New Democracy, which is running second to Syriza in the polls, would not comment on its tourism plan. The tax increase has been described as a temporary measure, though a clear time frame has not been provided. The party\u2019s leadership has also said the tax increase was the troika\u2019s idea, pointing the finger at an unpopular target, though party officials believe that the tourism industry is one of the few that can bear a tax increase.The proposal is creating strains within the party.On Monday, the government\u2019s tourism minister, Olga Kefalogianni, came out against it in an interview published by Naftemporiki, a financial newspaper.\u201cWe need to be taking initiatives that reinforce tourism and not measures that stop it,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI am saying clearly that the next government should aim for the withdrawal of this when negotiations with the troika resume after the election.\u201dSyriza\u2019s proposals reflect its populist ideology, which is aimed at curbing austerity policies and aiding small businesses and average citizens.\"For the all-inclusive, our view, as well as that of the tourism industry, is that it\u2019s not the best thing,\u201d said Michalis Kritsotakis, a Parliament member from Syriza who is responsible for the party\u2019s tourism policy. \u201cWhat we ask is a better quality of tourism, but the all-inclusive is not something that can be banned.\u201dHe called for a new model that would lead to \u201ca lesser number of all-inclusive packages in due time\u201d or \u201cthe stopping of the negative effects that the all-inclusive packages have.\u201d\u201cThe first thing that happens is that some tourists who use them do not have a good view of things because they are embedded in a hotel,\u201d he said, adding that some tourists \u201cdidn\u2019t even know what part of the country they were at.\u201dSome more-luxurious resorts are already changing tack, like the Ikos Oceania in Halkidiki in northern Greece, which has begun to incorporate local restaurants into a more expansive definition of \u201call-inclusive.\" But resorts that are more mass market would most likely have trouble expanding their offerings while keeping prices in check.\u201cYou cannot forbid or cancel all-inclusive; it\u2019s an international need of the customer,\u201d said Yiannis A. Retsos, managing director of Electra Hotels and Resorts and president of the Hellenic Hotel Federation.\u201cWe cannot discuss it seriously,\u201d he added.Mr. Phillips, the Welsh tourist, has noticed that the number of outside bars and restaurants around the Electra Palace has dwindled since the hotel began offering only all-inclusive deals a few years ago. But he said he would consider other countries if the all-inclusive deal disappeared.\u201cI would have to reconsider,\u201d he said. \u201cI would probably be able to find a better deal somewhere like Turkey, which is just across the water from Rhodes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s a black art of the highest order.The Yaris goes from 0 to 60 in about 11 seconds, and, with only four gear ratios, the engine revs high when the right foot stomps.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Community-College Plan: A Reading List", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigher EducationThe odds of a Republican Congress passing an Obama proposal on any issue aren\u2019t very high. But the interest of some Republicans in this issue makes it conceivable that Congress could pass a related program. Perhaps more likely, states and local governments could decide to implement their own, smaller versions of the Obama plan. White House officials argue that pattern has happened with minimum-wage increases and preschool programs, in which Mr. Obama\u2019s advocacy of an issue has given it local momentum.They instead advocate universal community college, with students freed from covering both tuition costs and living costs. Their proposal differs from Mr. Obama\u2019s in some substantial ways, including the fact that they would redirect federal money currently being spent on financial aid at private colleges. Yet it\u2019s also clear that White House officials devising their plan have thought about the Goldrick-Rab-Kendall plan.\u201cGoing to college is important to all families, as it increases the odds of upward mobility for children born into low- and moderate-income families, and protects against falling downward mobility for middle- and upper-income families,\u201d the two professors write. Their plan, they say, is based on \u201ca simple message to every American interested in pursuing education after high school: If you complete a high school degree, you can obtain a 13th and 14th year of education for free in exchange for a modest amount of work while attending school.\u201dThe Tribune added: \u201cEligible students must first apply for federal and state financial aid. Once those applications are complete, the scholarship will cover costs for up to three years above any aid the student receives.\u201dThe first of those criticisms is essentially a criticism that the programs are not generous enough; the Goldrick-Rab-Kendall plan is more generous, for instance. The second criticism comes from the other direction and argues that universal programs are less efficient and cost-effective than targeted ones.One potential implication is that by making community college universally free, the government is mostly reducing the cost for higher-income families. And so you can see the argument that the government should instead focus its limited resources on helping low-income students, including by helping them pay for things other than tuition. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not paying for tuition, you have to find some way to house, clothe, and feed yourself, and for many poor students, this means finding low-wage, part-time work,\u201d Mr. Salam writes. \u201cJuggling work and school can be challenging for many students, and this is doubtless a part of why college completion rates are so low.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that the policy will help lots of middle-class and upper-middle class students because increasing the economic diversity in community colleges will help strengthen the quality of education these institutions can provide. That is to say, while critics will complain that Obama\u2019s proposal will help middle- and upper-middle class students who don\u2019t need public support, there is good evidence that all students in community colleges will benefit from an economic mix. Today, wealthy students outnumber poor students at the most selective four-year colleges by 14:1, but community colleges educate twice as many low-income students as high-income students.\u201cCentury\u2019s task force concluded that the economic segregation in community colleges helps explain the dismal results: Eighty-one percent of students enter community college for the first time saying they eventually want to transfer and earn at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, but just 12 percent do so within six years. Having a stronger socioeconomic mix in community colleges should improve those outcomes.\u201dBeyond any potential effect on completion rates, universal community college has the potential to send a clear message that would affect many students and families. When the 20th century began, the lack of universal high school sent the message that not everyone needed a high school education. The universal high school movement changed that cultural norm. Today, you almost never hear anyone arguing, \u201cHigh school isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201dYet we never stop to ask why 13 years of universal education has become the magic number \u2014 and why it should permanently be so, given how much more complex our society and economy have become in the ensuing century. If nine years of free education was the sensible norm for the masses in the 19th century and 13 years was the sensible norm in the early 20th century, what is the right number in the 21st century?Our current system suggests that the answer is still 13. The performance of our economy suggests otherwise.Advertisement"}

His main challenger, Hakainde Hichilema, a wealthy businessman and economist who leads the United Party for National Development, received about 46.7 percent of the vote.The turnout was less than one-third of the electorate \u2014 a low level of participation that some analysts attributed to heavy rains that slowed the delivery of ballot boxes to remote areas and forced the extension of voting by a day in some parts of Zambia, a former British colony whose economy is heavily dependent on copper exports.In a contentious move after Mr. Sata\u2019s death, the interim government raised royalty taxes imposed on mining companies, which warned that the increase could cost thousands of jobs and possibly lead them to close some mines.

{"Headline": "Streit\u2019s Matzo Factory, a Piece of Lower East Side History, Is Moving On", "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the people who abandoned the squalor of the Lower East Side tenements have been moving back into those very same buildings, paying sums like $3,000 to rent apartments that a few decades before went for under $50, turning the neighborhood into one of New York City\u2019s hippest.\u201cFor the last few years, it\u2019s been clear we are the last remaining connection many Jews can relate to because their parents and grandparents came through the Lower East Side,\u201d said Alan M. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron Streit, the business\u2019s founder. \u201cMost of these places don\u2019t exist anymore, and it\u2019s very sad this one will be closing as well.\u201d\u201cThey could go on walking tours and afterward have the experience of stores selling Jewish food, Jewish pickles, Judaica shops,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the early 2000s they could still have that experience. It\u2019s mostly gone.\u201dThe pressure of gentrification, Mr. Adler said, is not the reason the factory is closing, since the family has resisted offers to sell for years. Rather, he said, \u201cthe reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us.\u201dThe two 75-foot ovens, which produce 900 pounds of matzo per hour, are slowing down with age, and \u201cwe can\u2019t find anyone to repair them,\u201d Mr. Adler said. The factory has no loading dock, and delivery trucks cannot find parking. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to do business in Manhattan,\u201d he said.The American matzo business has also been battered by the popularity of cheaper Israeli brands, some of which supermarkets give away free as Passover come-ons. (A five-pound package of Streit\u2019s matzos that can feed a family throughout the eight days of Passover can cost about $18.) Many Jews also splurge on the more expensive shmura matzos that are baked by hand in small factories in Hasidic neighborhoods and undergo more extensive rabbinical supervision.Mr. Adler and his relatives informed the factory\u2019s 50 workers on Monday, telling them they would find jobs at the company\u2019s New Jersey site if they could accommodate the commute.Streit\u2019s was started around 1915 by Aron Streit, an Austrian immigrant, who teamed up with a rabbi to open his first handmade matzo factory on nearby Pitt Street. A decade later, Aron and his oldest son, Irving, opened the Rivington Street factory in a single tenement. Another son, Jack, joined the business, and it did so well that it expanded into three adjoining tenements. Aron died in 1935.Today the business is run by Mr. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron\u2019s; Aron Yagoda, another of the founder\u2019s great-grandsons; and Aaron Gross, a great-great-grandson and the fifth generation in the business. Matzo-making was so woven into the family that the 63-year-old Mr. Adler gave up a legal career 15 years ago to become a vice president in charge of operations.At Streit\u2019s, the mixing and baking are done by machine. Three minutes of mixing, followed by a flattening of the dough and the punching of the characteristic holes and then a trip lasting 1 minute 40 seconds through the oven. But the aging ovens are taking longer to process the mixture, which can change the taste and helps explain why the factory is moving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Roots of Obama\u2019s Ambitious College Plan", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees of EducationThe roots of President Obama\u2019s ambitious proposal for free community college can be found in a 2008 book by the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz called \u201cThe Race Between Education and Technology.\u201d\u201cThe 20th century was the American century,\u201d they wrote, \u201cbecause it was the human-capital century.\u201dOn Friday, he will travel to Tennessee to announce a proposal to make community college free for any student who enrolls at least part-time and maintains a 2.5 grade point average. In a show of rare bipartisan force, he will be accompanied by the state\u2019s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, as well as its two Republican senators, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, White House officials said.The plan would allow anyone admitted to a community college to attend without paying tuition, so long as they enroll in a program meeting certain basic requirements and they remain on track to graduate in three years. Its broad goals are clear: to extend the amount of mass education available, for free, beyond high school \u2014 from K-through-12, to K-through-college.\u201cThe president thinks this is a moment like when we decided to make high school universal,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.The program is modeled in part on a program that Mr. Haslam has started in Tennessee and on one Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, has started. \u201cI actually think people who go there,\u201d Mr. Emanuel recently told me, referring to community colleges, \u201cdeserve as much attention as people in four-year colleges. They shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought.\u201dThe Obama proposal would apply not only to recent high school graduates, as the Chicago and Tennessee programs do, but also to adults going back to college. Colleges, to qualify for the federal plan, would need to offer credits that transferred to four-year colleges or training programs shown to lead to jobs.However important these details may be, it\u2019s also worth acknowledging the potential impact of the plan \u2014 which is huge. Battles over health care, immigration, gun control and other issues may attract more attention. But both history and economics suggest that nothing may have a greater effect on the future of living standards than education policy. Even if a federal program doesn\u2019t pass, the growth of state and local programs \u2014 like Chicago\u2019s and Tennessee\u2019s \u2014 have a large economic effect.Nearly a century has passed since the universal high school movement took off in the United States. And the world is clearly a far different place today than it was 100 years ago, with success depending vastly more on knowledge than it used to. If 13 years of education \u2014 K-through-12 \u2014 was the right amount of education for the typical citizen back then, it surely is not still the right amount today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Succession Line Is Set, but the Nation\u2019s Path Remains Uncertain", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s new king moved with unprecedented swiftness on Friday to appoint not only the heir to his throne but the heir to his heir as well.If all proceeds according to plan \u2014 as most Saudis and some analysts assume it will \u2014 the chain of succession dictated by King Salman after the death of his half brother Abdullah lays out who will be the head of state of one of the Arab world\u2019s richest and most influential nations through the middle of this century.Such a long-term road map represented a show of confidence in the national project, especially in an era when longtime Arab leaders have been tossed out by popular revolts and neighboring states like Iraq, Yemen and Syria are breaking apart.But analysts who study Saudi Arabia say that despite the ruling family\u2019s public display of unity and confidence, the kingdom faces profound internal pressures that its leaders have in many ways failed to address.For decades, members of the ruling family, supported by the country\u2019s staunchly conservative religious establishment, have maintained power through a combination of social control and state generosity, which has been underwritten by the vast revenues Saudi Arabia earns as the world\u2019s largest exporter of crude oil.While the Saudi model still mostly holds, generational shifts have begun to chip away at its coherence.Clerics still hold power and the religious police still patrol public spaces, but some religious dictates go unheeded. The kingdom recently let investors buy shares in a national bank in a multibillion-dollar initial public offering, despite statements from top clerics that buying shares was forbidden on religious grounds.The state has also lagged in integrating its large and not particularly well-educated youth population into the economy. A few hundred young men have given up on the kingdom and joined the jihadists of the Islamic State. Many others remain at home, either unemployed or underemployed.But the biggest challenge the country faces may be one at least partly of its own making: the decline in the oil revenues that form the economic foundation of the state. As the dominant producer in OPEC, Saudi Arabia\u2019s decisions on production levels have enormous influence on world oil markets, and it has maintained fairly high output in recent months despite an oversupplied market, helping to seriously depress prices.Saudi leaders use their oil income not only to influence regional politics, but to pacify their own people. After the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring toppled or threatened several allies in the region, Saudi Arabia responded by bankrolling its friends abroad and spending lavishly on domestic projects.\u201cThings are always sustainable in Saudi when they can afford to keep paying,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor of comparative politics at the London School of Economics.But the drop in oil prices has resulted in a $38.6 billion deficit in Saudi Arabia\u2019s budget for 2015. That could limit the country\u2019s ability to maneuver, but only if oil prices remain low for an extended period. The International Monetary Fund estimated Saudi Arabia\u2019s reserves at $750 billion, which can buy it time to wait for oil prices to go back up.\u201cThey have a cushion that they can live on for another decade or so, but they may not be able to afford it if the oil price stays low,\u201d Mr. Hertog said.Analysts said they did not expect Salman to pursue policies significantly different from those of his predecessor, King Abdullah. His only immediate initiative was clarifying who would succeed him. The issue was a pressing one because the new monarch is thought to be 79 years old, and he is said to be showing his age.The appointment of successors appeared to resolve a thorny generational issue. So far, every king of Saudi Arabia since the death in 1953 of the country\u2019s founder, King Abdulaziz, has been one of his dozens of sons, with Salman the sixth to reign.Under the royal decrees issued Friday, one more half brother \u2014 Muqrin, the youngest of Abdulaziz\u2019s sons deemed fit to rule \u2014 was named crown prince and next in line for the throne. After him will come the country\u2019s powerful interior minister, Mohammed bin Nayef, who was named deputy crown prince on Friday; he is the first heir to the throne from among Abdulaziz\u2019s grandsons.The most important ministries in the Saudi government are held by members of the royal family, and Salman did not announce any changes to the roster, other than to appoint his son Prince Mohammed bin Salman to replace him as defense minister and to lead the royal court. Longtime officials kept their posts, including Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who remains the national security council adviser.Frederic Wehrey, who studies Saudi Arabia for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the choice of Mohammed bin Nayef, the interior minister who is a leader in the Saudi fight against Islamic militants, suggested that relations with the United States would remain strong.\u201cThe centerpiece of Saudi-U.S. cooperation has always been on the intelligence level, and Mohammed bin Nayef has been at the center of that,\u201d he said.The new Saudi head of state is rumored in some quarters to be senile, but similar rumors swirled about Abdullah and he was still hailed as a heroic statesman around the world.How much the Saudi ruling family will change to address the country\u2019s challenges remains an open question. Some hailed King Abdullah as a reformer, noting that he defied the religious establishment to push for more women in the workplace and appointed 30 women to a royal advisory council.\u201cFrom an American perspective, it may look feeble, but it is meaningful in the context of this society,\u201d said Joseph Kechichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.Others note that Saudi women still cannot drive and dissidents are jailed and flogged for expressing views seen as commonplace elsewhere.Simon Henderson, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that domestic issues were less worrisome for the Saudi leadership than were the spreading problems in neighboring states. The collapse of Yemen\u2019s government has provided an opportunity to Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State is continuing to entice recruits to Iraq and Syria.\u201cIt is one thing to have one bit of trouble on the border,\u201d Mr. Henderson said. \u201cBut when you have several bits of trouble on the border, that is a bigger deal.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the royal line of succession dictated by King Salman of Saudi Arabia misstated his rank among the sons of the country\u2019s founder, King Abdulaziz, to reign as king. He is the sixth son to hold the throne, not the fifth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth Looks Great; Wage Growth, Less So", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Jobs ReportThe last few weeks have been a time of, dare we say it, buoyant optimism about the United States economy. The long winter slumber may be over, or so it has seemed after news of a 5 percent G.D.P. third-quarter growth rate and a November jobs report showing the strongest gains in years.This is all excellent news for the people holding one of the 2.95 million jobs that did not exist at the beginning of 2014 (the strongest year of job growth since 1999). And the numbers do nothing to throw cold water on the idea that the recovery has shifted into a higher gear in recent months. But forgive us for a moment of less than sunny optimism on this front.The big disappointment was on wages. In the November numbers, one of the brightest signs was an 0.4 percent rise in average hourly earnings, which was a hint that maybe, just maybe, a tighter job market was leading employers to raise wages after years of resisting.It turned out to be a false signal. In Friday\u2019s revisions, November wages rose only 0.2 percent. And even worse, in December they fell 0.2 percent.Over the last year, the average hourly wage in America has risen 40 cents, from $24.17 to $24.57 an hour. That is a mere 1.65 percent, in the same ballpark as many inflation readings and not a meaningful rise in real wages.The sharp decline in oil and gasoline prices in the last few months means that inflation is falling and may soon be negative, so that will increase the apparent \u201creal\u201d wage gains Americans are experiencing. But if hourly earnings were to tick upward at the same time prices fell, it would be a rare opportunity for a truly robust spurt of real wage growth \u2014 4 or 5 percent, for example \u2014 that would translate into significantly better living conditions.The latest wage numbers cast doubt that that will happen, and instead point to employers that continue to muddle along with wage increases in the same 1.5 to 2 percent range we\u2019ve seen for years. That of course could change as 2015 progresses, and the December number could well be revised, just as the November number was.Across the country, 16 percent of prime-age men are not working. Examine non-employment rates for every Census tract.And the lack of evidence of upward pressure on wages will give the Federal Reserve more confidence that they can be patient in considering interest rate increases, but it\u2019s small solace.One mild curiosity in the report is that the size of the labor force actually fell, with 273,000 people no longer either holding a job or looking for one. That may be a statistical aberration, but even over a longer period of time the steep drop in the labor force since 2008 has not reversed itself. It\u2019s partly demographic, with more baby boomers nearing retirement age. But the wage numbers also suggest another reason: When employers are so reluctant to raise pay, it shouldn\u2019t be shocking that more Americans choose to sit at home and remain out of the labor force.For now, though, it appears that employers are able to add jobs in mass numbers without offering meaningful wage increases, which isn\u2019t the New Year\u2019s message American workers are looking to hear.Advertisement"}

Most analysts had expected the central bank to keep interest rates high to help prop up the ruble, which has been plummeting against nearly every other currency in the world. The ruble has lost roughly 50 percent of its value over the last year.

In downgrading Russia\u2019s sovereign debt rating to junk status this month, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, in part, cited the central bank\u2019s limited options. The rate cut suggested that Russia viewed the banking troubles as a more pressing worry than the high inflation caused by the declining value of the ruble. Inflation is now about 13 percent. \u201cToday\u2019s decision,\u201d said Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the Bank of Russia, \u201cis intended to balance the goal of curbing inflation and restore economic growth.\u201d Russia is fighting a swirl of forces. The oil-dependent economy has been battered by the low price of crude, which is down more than 50 percent since this summer. Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis only complicate matters, particularly for Russia\u2019s banks. The economy is expected to fall into recession this year.The difficult environment has left the central bank grappling with how to respond. In December, the bank raised rates 6.5 percentage points to 17 percent in an only partly effective effort to stem panic-selling of the ruble; selling continued all the same. On Friday, the central bank partly rolled back the increase, reducing rates 2 percentage points, to 15 percent.The reversal reflects the shifting priorities of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government in maintaining a stable exchange rate for the ruble, once considered one of the accomplishments of his rule after the economically chaotic 1990s. On Friday, the value of the ruble, which dropped sharply after the rate cut, eventually ended at 69.50 to the dollar. Just a year ago, it traded around 35 to the dollar. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Think About Refinancing Your Mortgage", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsThe average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.8 percent at the end of last week. That is down from 4.5 percent as recently as last spring, the lowest since May 2013 and far below the 5 percent-plus rates that prevailed as recently as early 2011.The math can be as simple as you want or as complex; here\u2019s how to think of the decision.When considering whether to refinance, you are exploiting the fact that you can fully repay a home mortgage whenever you want and take out a new one. If rates rise, you can stick with your old one as long as you continue to own your home; if they fall, you can pay off the old mortgage and get a new one. Heads you win, tails your lender loses. Seldom in life does this dynamic apply, so it is worth exploiting whenever the opportunity arises.Everyone\u2019s details are different, but if the current rate is half a percentage point below the rate on your mortgage, a refinance is potentially compelling. If it is closer to a gap of a full percentage point, it may be a slam dunk unless you expect to move soon.But taking out a new mortgage comes with costs, such as origination and appraisal fees \u2014 typically in the low four figures. The open question is whether you will enjoy the benefits of lower rates for long enough to cover that upfront cost.As a hypothetical, a family that took out a $400,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in June 2013 at 4.6 percent could save $187 a month by refinancing $400,000 at a 3.8 percent rate. (If instead of taking cash out they borrowed only the $389,826 they should owe on the mortgage at this point, they would save $234 a month, reflecting both the lower interest rate and a smaller principal.)Before taking the plunge, though, our family has to decide how long it expects to stay in the home. If transaction fees add up to $4,000, for example, the family needs to stay in the home for at least 21 more months (if borrowing $400,000; 17 months if borrowing $389,826) to justify the transaction (or a bit longer if you also try to account for the tax savings they are not receiving because they are paying less to the bank in mortgage interest).Or here\u2019s another intriguing possibility. Let\u2019s say our family has seen its income rise since originally taking out the home loan in mid-2013. The interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is now a mere 2.9 percent. An option would be to refinance the $389,825 currently owed into a 15-year mortgage. That would increase the monthly payment by $623 a month \u2014 but would result in paying the home loan off entirely in 2030, not 2043 as the family was previously on track to do.As with all major financial decisions, the details of each family\u2019s situation can add all kinds of complexity that are worth gaming out and analyzing carefully. But for the economy as a whole, this latest shift in rates has a particular silver lining.In years past, mortgage rates have dipped when it looked as if the United States economy could be falling back toward recession, and the Federal Reserve intervened with easier money to try to stop that from happening. This time, the economy is looking relatively strong and the Fed is making plans to raise interest rates.This drop in mortgage rates is being driven by a combination of plummeting oil prices, which are reducing investors\u2019 expectations for inflation in the years ahead, and a tumultuous global economic environment, which is leading investors worldwide to plow money into safe American assets. That includes the bonds packaged by the government-sponsored mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which in turn fund most of the nation\u2019s consumer mortgages.In other words, global investors are so desperate for a safe place to park cash and so confident that inflation is nowhere to be found that they are flinging money at United States homeowners. Americans now paying significantly above-market rates on their home loan might at least do them the favor of picking it up.Advertisement"}

If you have a fixed income, deflation is not such a bad idea.\u201dFootballs that the Patriots used in their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the A.F.C. championship game had too little air, which violated N.F.L. rules and made them easier to throw, catch and carry.Coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady said they knew nothing about why the balls were underinflated. The Patriots have stopped talking about it, and the N.F.L. said it was investigating the matter. The inquiry could take weeks.In the meantime, at bounce houses, bike shops, tire stores and ivory towers, there are plenty of experts to explain the advantages and disadvantages of deflation.\u201cYou\u2019re going to feel like it\u2019s hard to pedal,\u201d Ruben Flores, owner of the Bike Zone, said of underinflated tires. \u201cThe bike\u2019s going to make you tired. And you could ruin the tire.\u201dMario Aguilar, manager of Secrets for Adults, stood near a display of life-size blowup dolls. One was named Sultry Nurse, and another was called Mr. Stud. For best results, Aguilar explained, they should be fully inflated. There is little advantage in letting some air out.\u201cThey won\u2019t feel right,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cYou do need to have a good, full balloon.\u201dIn the N.F.L., secretly squishy footballs have become a serious issue. Fans now know what most did not before: Each team has its own set of footballs to use on offense, and they are required to have between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch of air pressure. Officials reportedly discovered that 11 of New England\u2019s 12 balls were deflated during the game against Indianapolis.For critics of football in general, or the Patriots specifically, the scandal serves as a cultural proxy for people\u2019s appetite to cheat or excuse those who do. The story has led the network nightly news programs and been daily fodder for tabloid newspapers. Some suggested last week that the Patriots forfeit the Super Bowl or that Belichick and Brady be suspended.Among those who found the whole thing a bit funny were people who spent their working lives filling things with air.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a couple of pounds less of air pressure,\u201d said Hector Reyes, a service manager at a Firestone Complete Auto Care. \u201cYou\u2019re not playing with a pancake. They\u2019re making a big deal about it. I think it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dWhat is not a joke is driving on underinflated tires. At Val\u2019s Tires, the owner, Valery Yusupov, knew nothing of Deflategate. But he knows the importance of keeping tires filled to recommended standards, which is often around 40 pounds per square inch for passenger cars.\u201cNo. 1, it\u2019s going to cost you gas mileage,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 2, you can ruin your sidewall if it\u2019s too low, and the whole pressure goes on your sidewall and not the tread. The tire\u2019s going to wear out a lot faster.\u201dTold that the Patriots had argued that the footballs in question might have deflated naturally, losing two pounds of pressure in the cold weather, Yusupov nodded.\u201cWhen the weather cools off here, lots of people come in and say, \u2018Looks like my tire is too low,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Yusupov said.At Secrets for Adults, Aguilar said the store sold a few blowup dolls a week, with a high ratio going to truckers and hosts of bachelor parties. And while underinflation is not recommended, the alternative might be worse.\u201cWe\u2019ve had people try to return them when they\u2019ve popped,\u201d he said.At tire stores and bike shops, workers use gauges to check inflation. At the party balloon store, Rios uses her finger. She puts it on the stem of the balloon, and when she feels it start to bubble under her finger, she stops.Deflation is the opposite \u2014 the falling of prices. But as prices fall, profits often do, too, and economies have been known to spiral downward.\u201cAn advantage of deflation, and I hope people don\u2019t take this too seriously, is that money can be viewed as an asset,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cIt has a positive rate of return because if you hold money from today to tomorrow, and there is deflation, it\u2019s like the money is gaining interest. If there is inflation, holding money is essentially a tax.\u201dVentura was less certain what any of this had to do with the Super Bowl.

Germany, Europe\u2019s largest auto market, grew 2.9 percent. The French market remained moribund, expanding by only 0.2 percent.The main winners were down-market models like Renault\u2019s Dacia brand, which posted a nearly 24 percent increase in sales last year. Skoda, Volkswagen\u2019s low-cost offering, posted a 14 percent gain.Sales ended the year with decent momentum, gaining 4.7 percent in December from a year earlier, the association said.Still, the industry is not out of danger yet.

{"Headline": "Economic Freedom Does Not Necessarily Lead to Greater Tolerance", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewDifferences in race, religion and sexual orientation have erupted in violence around the world recently, making it all too clear that tolerance is an ideal that our societies haven\u2019t fully achieved.What isn\u2019t well known is that economists have been studying tolerance and its preconditions for many years, discovering some fascinating yet also unsettling truths.Since the Enlightenment of the 18th century, for example, it\u2019s often been assumed that when you trade with other people you tend to become more tolerant of their differences because mutual understanding increases with greater contact. Furthermore, tolerance is in most people\u2019s individual self-interest because the truly intolerant forgo economic benefits \u2014 losing the chance to hire the best workers and to sell to all available customers. For those reasons, as commerce increases and economies grow more sophisticated, discrimination and prejudice should diminish, or so it has been thought. One of their most striking findings is that societies characterized by greater economic freedom and greater wealth do indeed exhibit greater tolerance toward gay people, a tendency suggesting that gay rights, including gay marriage, will spread globally as national economies liberalize and develop. In other words, if a society allows individuals to engage in consenting capitalist activities with a minimum of legal regulation, we might also expect tolerance of a variety of other choices, including those regarding sexual behavior. Identifying cause and effect can be difficult in such studies, but increases in economic freedom have been associated with increases in this kind of tolerance. Score one for the Enlightenment. This is no small matter. With the Supreme Court considering legalization of gay marriage throughout the entire United States and not just in the states in which gay marriage is legal now, the paper implies that such a decision would stand on the side of history. There is a catch, though. This greater tolerance is strongly associated only with certain features of what has often been defined as economic freedom. For example, a smaller government, measured as a share of gross domestic product, is often included in so-called economic freedom indexes as an objective measure of freedom. But the data show that smaller government has a slight negative correlation with tolerance of gay people by heterosexuals. One implication is that many conservatives may be overly preoccupied with the size of government as a measure of how free societies actually are. On the other hand, the data shows that when a society has impressive scores on property rights security and low inflation \u2014 two other components of economic freedom indexes \u2014 these characteristics are strongly and positively correlated with tolerance of gays. It\u2019s possible that low inflation, and the behavior of a central bank, are stand-ins for the general trustworthiness of a nation\u2019s government and broader institutions, and such trustworthiness helps foster tolerance. Another lesson from this data is that economic forces alone are not all-powerful. Both economic freedom and wealth have much closer associations with tolerance when a society exhibits high levels of trust, as measured by the attitudes that people report when surveyed. In other words, economic freedom, wealth and good human values seem to work together, although the causality is murky. Questions of trust occupy only a secondary position in economics and arguably deserve much more attention.How can prejudice be dismantled? We are often told that education is an important remedy, yet it does not register as a meaningful factor in the cross-country data in this paper. Higher levels of education simply have not correlated significantly with higher levels of tolerance across countries. Income inequality is also not a significant variable. It would be premature to conclude that education and income have no influence, but we should re-examine the pieties that suggest they are of major importance for tolerance.Finally, the paper offers an intriguing result drawn from data on Muslims who responded to polling questions around the world: Compared with non-Muslims, they are much less tolerant of gay individuals but no less tolerant of differences across the races.None of these results should be taken as the final word, but they point in some intriguing directions. Economists respect numbers, but we also ought to do more to recognize the meaning of human values and perceptions. Commercial incentives and wealth matter but they are not decisive. Societies do not build trust automatically and so prejudice does not always fall away. The moral quality of our government, and our governance, is important for the fabric of society at the micro level. And finally, not all kinds of prejudice are affected by the same factors. We may make big progress in one area while standing still or perhaps even moving backward in others.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Won\u2019t Raise Interest Rates Before June, at Earliest", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve kept its options open on Wednesday, signaling that it would not raise short-term interest rates any earlier than June, while leaving unresolved how much longer it might be willing to wait before lifting its benchmark rate from near zero, where the central bank has held it for more than six years.But the optimistic tone was tempered by the Fed\u2019s acknowledgment that inflation has slowed markedly in recent months and is likely to slow even more, making it harder for the Fed to determine how quickly to retreat from its stimulus campaign.Fed officials for more than a year have pointed to the summer of 2015 as the likely time for the central bank to increase its benchmark interest rate, but investors are increasingly convinced that the sluggish pace of inflation will force the Fed to wait until fall at the earliest.The Fed, for now, is basically watching economic developments to see what happens.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to exclude June from the range of options at this point,\u201d said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon who follows the Fed closely. \u201cJune is still five months off, and they have no intention of deciding just yet.\u201dThe Fed has tried for years to spur faster job growth, and it seems to be working. Average monthly job gains have increased in each of the last five years, reaching 246,000 a month last year. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in December, closing in on its prerecession level of around 5 percent.The economic expansion is gaining strength as confident consumers spend more, heartened by the rise in employment and the fall in oil prices.The weakness of the global economy received only a passing mention, in a sentence noting that the Fed would pay attention to \u201cinternational developments.\u201d Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, said Fed officials seemed relatively sanguine about the problems of other developed nations.\u201cAltogether, we believe the Fed sees the combination of central bank actions and lower oil prices as outweighing the negative effects on growth and inflation from a stronger dollar,\u201d Mr. Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.The Fed\u2019s stated goal is to keep prices rising at an annual rate of about 2 percent, part of its effort to support economic growth and grease the wheels of commerce. But it has not hit that target in more than two years, and it is increasingly unlikely to achieve it this year.The rapid fall of oil prices is largely responsible for the decline, and the statement reiterated the view of most Fed officials that inflation will rebound \u201cas the labor market improves further and the transitory effect of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.\u201dThe short-term fluctuations, however, make it harder for the Fed to determine how much of the recent decline in inflation might reflect more enduring economic weakness. Mr. Duy predicted that wage growth would play a critical role in determining the Fed\u2019s timing. Average hourly earnings rose only 1.7 percent in 2014, reflecting an abundance of job seekers. Moreover, until wages rise more quickly, higher inflation most likely would not endure because it would erode real wages, reducing demand.\u201cThey really need to see some wage growth in order for them to move in June,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cUnless you have enough pressure on labor markets to generate higher wages, it\u2019s tough to see how you get to sustainably higher inflation.\u201dThe statement was passed by a unanimous vote, a contrast with the three dissents at the previous meeting in December of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s policy-making body, which also met on Wednesday. The change, however, does not necessarily reflect greater internal harmony. Instead, the three regional reserve bank presidents who dissented in December rotated out of voting seats on the committee and were replaced by three members of the majority.The statement, as expected, said for the second consecutive meeting that the Fed \u201cjudges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said after the Fed\u2019s December meeting that the language indicated that the Fed would wait at least two meetings before raising rates. Its inclusion in the latest statement means the Fed does not intend to act at its meetings in March or April.That puts the focus on the Fed\u2019s meeting in June.Fed officials have long pointed to that June meeting as the most likely date for a first rate increase, and some analysts continue to regard that as a good bet. But investors are increasingly skeptical. Measures derived from asset prices suggest that investors do not expect a first rate increase until autumn. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell 10 basis points on Wednesday. David Mericle, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote last week that the Fed \u201cwould find it hard to justify\u201d a rate increase while inflation continued to decelerate.Goldman still predicts that the Fed will raise rates this year. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, predicted on Monday that the Fed would not raise rates until 2016.\u201cWe believe the F.O.M.C. would risk entrenching inflation expectations at levels inconsistent with its 2 percent goal if it were to push forward with rate hikes as early as June,\u201d Morgan\u2019s economic forecasters wrote in a research note.Some Fed officials have cautioned that the difference between June and September may matter to investors, but it does not have much economic significance.\u201cAfter six years of recovery and considering all that has both transpired and been accomplished, I don\u2019t think we policy makers should get too rigid about liftoff a little earlier or later,\u201d Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech this month. Mr. Lockhart and other officials have also sought to emphasize that the first rate increase will not end the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign because the Fed is likely to keep rates at unusually low levels for years to come.Advertisement"}

That average supports the narrative that the economic recovery so far has only boosted the incomes of the rich, and it has yielded no improvement for the bottom 99 percent of the distribution. After adjusting for inflation, the average income for the richest 1 percent (excluding capital gains) has risen from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 over 2012 and 2013. By contrast, for the remaining 99 percent, average incomes fell by a few dollars from $44,000 to $43,900.That is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent. By contrast, this group suffered only one-third of the income declines during the preceding recession.When we count the robust increase in capital gains, the overall recovery appears stronger. But because capital gains are largely enjoyed by the rich, it remains the case that nearly all the fruits of that recovery have gone to the rich.Perhaps we need to be patient, and the recent pickup in employment is yielding more broadly shared growth that will become evident when the data for 2014 are released.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modest Rise in Inflation Gives China Room to Act", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is increasingly likely to take new action to bolster growth, economists said, after figures released on Friday showed that inflation in the country remains near its lowest levels in five years.In China, prices are falling because of weak domestic demand and the downturn in commodity markets. For example, prices for coal, iron ore and copper are at their lowest levels in at least five years, and China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer of all three.Consumer prices in China rose a meager 1.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the official statistics agency said Friday. The slight uptick from November\u2019s 1.5 percent increase was because of a spike in prices of fresh fruit and vegetables. Producer prices continued to fall for the 34th consecutive month, declining 3.3 percent from a year earlier, driven by declining commodity prices.The easing inflationary pressure gives the central bank more room to attempt to lift growth and experiment with financial liberalization. In November, the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, cut benchmark interest rates for the first time since the summer of 2012. Analysts expect more rate cuts to follow in the coming months, as China\u2019s economy is forecast to have grown in 2014 at its slowest pace in over two decades. Final figures for last year\u2019s gross domestic product are scheduled to be released on Jan. 20.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has said that the world should get used to this \u201cnew normal\u201d of China growing at a slower but more sustainable pace. Policy makers hope to curb China\u2019s reliance on credit-fueled investment and government spending, replacing them with consumer demand as a crucial driver of growth.But the continued weak price increases signal a potential risk that China could tip into deflation, where an economy becomes trapped in broad and persistent price declines that depresses spending and curtails employment, curbing overall growth.Wary of these risks, economists generally expect the central bank to respond with more interest rate cuts. They are divided, however, over whether this would also include a move to allow banks to lend out more of the cash that they are currently required to hold on reserve \u2014 a reduction of the so-called reserve requirement ratio.\u201cChina\u2019s central bank appears to be reluctant to cut reserve requirement ratio to counter falling prices and economic slowdown,\u201d Li-Gang Liu, the chief China economist at the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group, wrote Friday in a research note.\u201cChinese authorities will need to use both structural reform measures as well as monetary policy tools to head off the risk of deflation, especially when domestic demand remains weak and commodity and energy prices continue to fall,\u201d he wrote, adding that such structural measures could include making China\u2019s water, energy and utility prices more market driven.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Leader in Greece Now Faces Creditors", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 As the new Greek prime minister turns to fulfilling his campaign pledge of renegotiating his country\u2019s bailout loans and reducing its staggering debt burden, he may find that Greece\u2019s international creditors will be harder to persuade than the country\u2019s voters.\u201cWe will bring an end to the vicious circle of austerity,\u201d Mr. Tsipras promised a cheering crowd after his victory on Sunday.On Monday, eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels said they would begin negotiations with the Greek government on the terms of financial support, but warned that the talks would be arduous. And they made clear that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 they were unlikely to oblige Mr. Tsipras on his demands, especially his pledge to seek a write-down of Greece\u2019s huge debt. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of support for that in the eurozone,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the group of eurozone finance ministers. Nor were European officials inclined to accommodate Mr. Tsipras\u2019s demands for Greece\u2019s creditors to renegotiate the terms of a bailout program that has totaled 240 billion euros, or about $270 billion at current exchange rates.\u201cThere are rules that must be met in the eurozone,\u201d Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview published on Monday by Le Monde. The I.M.F. is one of Greece\u2019s three main creditors, along with the European Central Bank and the European Commission.\u201cWe cannot make special exceptions for specific countries,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said.Still, as Mr. Tsipras moves to carry out his pledges, the standoff may ultimately find both sides reaching a middle ground \u2014 one on which Greece could move toward an eventual economic and social recovery, with European officials at least partly relaxing their insistence on strict budgetary discipline.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the euro area is going to give Greece another extension of a few months for the new government to be formed and negotiations to begin,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Mr. Tsipras \u201cmay try to deliver a centrist swing,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said, but if all that fails, \u201cthen you\u2019re going to have a period of acute instability.\u201dMr. Tsipras\u2019s new coalition government, which his leftist party Syriza formed on Monday with a rightist fringe party that has taken its own hard line against austerity measures, does not have a lot of time. Greece needs its next allocation of bailout money \u2014 a \u20ac7 billion payment \u2014 to keep the government running and pay off looming debts to avoid a potential default.But Mr. Tsipras, who once likened his stance toward Europe\u2019s leaders to \u201cplaying poker,\u201d has begun the game aggressively against the three big creditors, known as the troika.In his victory speech, he seemed to invite a showdown. \u201cThe troika has no role to play in this country,\u201d he told supporters. But then, without explaining the distinction, he vowed to negotiate with Greece\u2019s European partners to produce \u201ca fair solution so that Greece can come out of debt, and Europe can return to stability and social cohesion.\u201dMr. Tsipras has insisted that the issue of debt relief concerns not only Greece but also other eurozone countries as the currency union, with 19 members, is now halfway through what threatens to be a decade of anemic economic growth. He has called for a European conference similar to the one held after World War II that wrote off half of West Germany\u2019s debt and extended the repayment period for the rest, to stoke a recovery.But some analysts say that Mr. Tsipras may not have the luxury of floating grand regional strategies. \u201cHe needs to be able to find a solution that resumes financial flows to Greece, and he doesn\u2019t have much time,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. \u201cIn this game of poker, there is a question of who of the many people sitting around the table will blink first.\u201dThose with whom Mr. Tsipras must deal, Mr. El-Erian noted, include not only the troika, but also Germany \u2014 the biggest individual country contributor to the Greek bailout \u2014 as well as private creditors.Mr. Tsipras has vowed not to adhere to the austerity conditions required for Greece to get the \u20ac7 billion payment, which would be the last installment of the bailout package. But Ms. Lagarde warned that Mr. Tsipras was conflating the notion of austerity with basic reforms needed to improve the Greek economy.\u201cThey must reform the efficiency of the state and get their tax collection system working,\u201d she said in the interview with Le Monde. \u201cThat\u2019s not austerity. Those are reforms that they still need to do.\u201dMs. Lagarde\u2019s view matters in Athens because Greece has a \u20ac2.5 billion I.M.F. loan it is obliged to pay off by March, and billions more in debt to the European Central Bank due in July.\u201cWould a Syriza-led government honor that?\u201d asked Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cBecause for \u20ac460 million, you can feed a lot of homeless people.\u201dThe elections also create a quandary for the European Central Bank, which must balance its role as guarantor of financial stability in the eurozone with the fact that it holds about \u20ac25 billion in Greek government debt.The European Central Bank on Monday declined to comment on the Greek election results, but the bank is unlikely to agree to accept any losses on the Greek bonds that it already owns.\u201cGreece has to pay, those are the rules of the European game,\u201d Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said in an interview with the French radio station Europe 1 on Monday. The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, spoke up for Mr. Tsipras when talking to reporters on Monday in Brussels.\u201cIf this new government was elected, it\u2019s also because Greece has lost 25 percent of its national wealth in the space of five years,\u201d Mr. Sapin said. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely heavy, extremely hard for people to bear.\u201d Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, James Kanter from Brussels and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Licenses in Spotlight as Uber Rises", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhat lesson should we draw from the success of Uber?Drivers like it, too. By the end of last year, the service had grown to over 160,000 active drivers offering at least four drives a month, from near zero in mid-2012. And the analysis by Mr. Krueger and Mr. Hall suggests they make at least as much as regular taxi drivers and chauffeurs, on flexible hours. Often, they make more.This kind of exponential growth confirms what every New Yorker and cab riders in many other cities have long suspected: Taxi service is woefully inefficient. It also raises a question of broader relevance: Why stop here?Just as limited taxi medallions can lead to a chronic undersupply of cabs at 4 p.m., the state licensing regulations for many occupations are creating bottlenecks across the economy, raising the prices of many goods and services and putting good jobs out of reach of too many Americans.Sometimes professional licenses make sense, ensuring decent standards of health and safety. I\u2019m reassured that if I ever need brain surgery, the doctor performing it will have been recognized by the profession to be up to the task. We don\u2019t want to return to the 19th century, when barbers pulled teeth and freelance doctors with no certification peddled miraculous cures.But like taxi medallions, state licenses required to practice all sorts of jobs often serve merely to cordon off occupations for the benefit of licensed workers and their lobbying groups, protecting them from legitimate competition.This comes at a substantial social cost. \u201cLower-income people suffer from licensing,\u201d Professor Krueger told me. \u201cIt raises the costs of many services and prevents low-income people from getting into some professions.\u201dThe trend worries the Obama administration. The president\u2019s budget, to be unveiled on Monday, will include $15 million for states to analyze the costs and benefits of their licensing rules, identify best practices and explore making licenses portable across state lines.\u201cWe would like all states to ask whether licensing requirements meet a cost-benefit test,\u201d said Betsey Stevenson of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.Jeffrey Zients, who heads the National Economic Council, added, \u201cUltimately, a worker that can do the job should be able to get the job.\u201dThe budget will also include $500 million to develop industry-recognized credentials that community colleges could teach to and employers could use for hiring, potentially reducing the need for state-sanctioned licenses in the future.For starters, state governments might try to agree on just how much protection the public needs.Locksmiths must be licensed in only 13, upholsterers and dental assistants in seven and shampooers in only five. Iowa requires 490 days of education and training to become a licensed cosmetologist; New York requires 233.Among the tangle of regulations, it is not hard to find rules that defy common sense. An athletic trainer must put in 1,460 days of training to get a license in Michigan. An emergency medical technician needs only 26.But the claim that they protect consumers often rings hollow.Nurse practitioners can prescribe medicines in Arizona but not in Alabama. In Alabama, doctors must write them.\u201cProfessional organizations that push for licenses can\u2019t say, \u2018We want to erect a fence around our occupation,\u2019 so they say it is to protect public health and safety,\u201d said Dick M. Carpenter II, research director at the Institute for Justice. \u201cIt is an assertion with zero evidence.\u201dLicenses do serve as legal cudgels to protect practitioners from competition.\u201cCosmetologists are putting hair braiders out of business,\u201d Mr. Kleiner said. \u201cVeterinarians are going after people who file horse teeth, saying they need a veterinary license.\u201dThe Obama administration will have a hard time overcoming the power of professional associations, particularly given that many states receive significant revenue from licensing fees.There might be another way, however, to loosen the grip of professional lobbies on the economy.To hear the dentists, the case is simply about the state\u2019s right to regulate as it sees fit: That six of eight members on the dental board are dentists elected by other dentists who stand to lose money to unlicensed rivals should have no bearing on the decision.But it is hard to overlook the pecuniary interests at stake. The American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry reported that in 2006 its members performed, on average, 70 teeth-whitening procedures for annual revenue of $25,000, or $350 a pop. Unlicensed rivals do it for $150.The issue goes beyond teeth. Associations for osteopaths have come out in support of North Carolina\u2019s dental board; so have anesthesiologists, midwives, optometrists and even engineers and surveyors.Supporting the dental board are the International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards, the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards and the American Association of Veterinary State Boards.For them, as for the taxi drivers battling Uber, the most important issue is whether they can maintain a lock on their professions and legally keep competition at bay. But is that a legitimate reason for the public to bear the cost of such cartels?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lavish Malls Sprouting Up to Attract Iranian Elite", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTehran JournalTEHRAN \u2014 The low rumble of powerful engines reverberated against the high-rises of Zaferanieh, an upmarket neighborhood, as Porsches and Mercedeses lined up to enter the multistory parking lot of a fancy new shopping mall, the Palladium, the latest addition to Tehran\u2019s shopping scene.In part, the malls are a lagging indicator, a testament to a not-so-distant past when Iran was raking in record oil profits, earning more than $700 billion in the last decade. Awash in money, with a relatively strong currency, Iranians developed a taste for luxury, setting off a boom in construction projects to host new shopping experiences.But the mall-building boom also reflects other factors, as construction and investment companies affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the police have led the way.\u201cUnder sanctions, with nowhere else to invest, building shopping malls is the only lucrative business in Iran,\u201d said Jamshid Edalatian, an economist. \u201cThe Guards, the police and other institutions are the ones who have money, so it is logical for them to invest in what makes a profit.\u201dTogether with banks, wealthy individuals and powerful foundations, tax-exempt organizations that are supposed to care for the poor, Iran\u2019s security forces are building malls with Western-sounding names such as Rose, Mega Mall and Atlas Plaza. Their bright neon letters stand in sharp contrast to the revolutionary slogans painted on murals in surrounding neighborhoods, labeling consumerism a Western illness and taboo under Iran\u2019s rigid ideology.Not so long ago, shopping in revolutionary Iran was a dull experience, with hole-in-the-wall stores offering the same clothes, electronics and furniture. Shopping was considered a necessary evil meant to support a life of religious piety. Commercials, once banned on state television and billboards, are now allowed, but only for Iranian products.The new malls represent a departure from all this. Customers can stroll past Nike and Massimo Dutti stores, order freshly baked baguettes in the ground level supermarket or work out at the penthouse gym overlooking the city and its majestic Alborz mountain range.\u201cWe cater to what people desire to do: spending money, buying stuff and enjoying themselves as they shop,\u201d said the owner of the Palladium, Hassan Raftari, who described himself as a shopaholic. The scion of a family famous for its kebab restaurants, Mr. Raftari led a business expansion into the construction of luxury apartment buildings. During his trips abroad, he said, he would always wonder why shopping in Iran was so boring.\u201cSo I decided to build my own shopping center,\u201d he said, stressing that his mall is 100 percent private owned. He is now selling the mall\u2019s 250 shops one by one, reportedly at prices of around $330 a square meter, or roughly $30 a square foot. \u201cWe have 1,000 parking spaces and my only mistake has been that I haven\u2019t built more,\u201d Mr. Raftari said.The colossal Mega Mall has just opened its doors near Tehran\u2019s Mehrabad airport. Less than a mile to the north is the Kouroosh mall, a massive glass building that is home to shops and cinemas. The d\u00e9cor is determinedly Western, in line with the tastes and lifestyles of their target middle- and upper-class customers.\u201cIt is just such a pleasant experience,\u201d said Fatemeh Gholipour as she pushed her cart last week through the long and well-stocked aisles of the Palladium\u2019s supermarket. \u201cThey have everything under one roof. It is just like the malls I have seen in Dubai and Turkey. I feel modern shopping here.\u201dFor urban Iranians, many of whom have seen their income dwindle during years of sanctions, the malls are a confirmation of their growing influence.Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the state has dominated public spaces, using murals, the morals police and state media to emphasize what officials say are unchangeable revolutionary values. In private, though, Iranians have moved on, embracing satellite TV and the Internet, widening their world views and comparing their lives to those of people in Turkey, Malaysia, Europe and other popular destinations.From that perspective, the ornate shopping malls stand out as middle-class outposts in the state-controlled economy, indicators of Iranians\u2019 increasing desire to join the modern world, experts say.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.\u201cNowadays, there are just so many urbanized, middle-class people in Tehran who aspire to Western lifestyles,\u201d said Kazem Alireza, a history researcher working for the Parliament. \u201cTheir needs are met by developers who offer them consumerism, just like the Western patterns of urbanization and changing lifestyles. Shopping malls make people happy; at least for now they are satisfied with them.\u201dThe boom in shopping malls is just simple economics, insiders say. \u201cBasically a group of 10 to 20 very wealthy individuals and state institutions are building all the malls,\u201d said the chief executive of a design company that serves the shopping centers, who asked not to be named for fear of losing business. \u201cThey have moved from housing projects to malls. It\u2019s just very profitable.\u201dMany of the institutions catering to the consumers\u2019 every whim are the same ones charged with enforcing public adherence to puritanical Islamic strictures on dress and behavior. A business magazine, Tejarat-e Farda, reported last year that Iran\u2019s police have their own construction arm, the Saze Paydar Gharn, that is currently building the Rose mall in West Tehran.Mr. Edalatian, the economist and a member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, pointed out that there is very little land left for massive shopping malls in a densely populated city like Tehran. \u201cThose are often owned by state foundations,\u201d he said.He also noted that the state prefers the shopping malls to the chaotic bazaars, as it is easier to collect value added taxes from them, currently at 8 percent.\u201cTry to get taxes from four million individual shops in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more centralized, the better.\u201dIn the Palladium, a couple dropped their child off at a playground in Bookland, and then went off to browse the shelves. Smiling attendants rushed to help customers at Electronic City, where tablets and iPhones lay on tables for all to test.\u201cThis mall is not only changing our shopping culture, it\u2019s also a place where people are nice to each other. Most people you see here are smiling and not stressed out as they are elsewhere in this city,\u201d said Mobin Cheraghi, who was recently promoted to assistant to Mr. Raftari. \u201cIt shows that Iranians can have a Western lifestyle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shifting Politics of Net Neutrality Debate Ahead of F.C.C. Vote", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut what was, on the surface, a simple fight over big government versus small has put Republicans in the awkward position of aligning themselves with the cable giants, among the most maligned industries in the country, against the sad Netflix viewer waiting for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d to break through its \u201cbuffering\u201d vortex.But it would also prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from issuing regulations to achieve those goals \u2014 the approach favored by the Obama administration and most Internet companies.\u201cThe ground has shifted,\u201d said Chip Pickering, a former Republican House member now lobbying for small Internet service providers who support net neutrality regulations. \u201cRepublicans lumped net neutrality in with the carbon tax and Obamacare: \u2018He\u2019s taking over everything and now he wants to take over the Internet.\u2019 But it was a reactive, visceral response without a real understanding.\u201dThe arcane fight over net neutrality is about to burst into the open. House and Senate panels will hold hearings on Wednesday pitting the heads of the cable television and wireless lobbies against Amazon and scrappy little Etsy, an online craft market.\u201cBy turning the F.C.C. away from a heavy-handed and messy approach to regulating the Internet, this draft protects both consumers who rely on Internet services and innovators who create jobs,\u201d Mr. Thune said about his legislation in a statement.Internet companies and online activists say Republicans have adopted the language of the net neutrality movement, even as they carry the water of the cable companies, and they are preparing for battle.Once again, an Internet regulatory showdown might be guided as much by grass-roots guerrilla tactics as the lobbying of Comcast and Verizon. The F.C.C. has received four million comments on net neutrality \u2014 overwhelmingly in favor \u2014 ahead of its Feb. 26 decision day, second only to Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d at the Super Bowl in 2004.Internet activists, backed by many Internet companies, like Reddit, Vimeo, Netflix and Tumblr, staged an Internet slowdown in September to draw attention to their cause, much as online stunts by Wikipedia and Google in early 2012 stunned the powerful motion picture and music industries and helped bring down the Stop Online Piracy Act.This time, the fight might be even more palpable to consumers. Companies like Netflix say they need protection against behemoths like Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Time Warner Cable, which could use their power over cable and fiber-optic lines to slow consumer access to websites that offer competing content or fail to pay for fast service.Between summer 2013 and early 2014, Comcast customers found their access to Netflix getting progressively slower as Netflix\u2019s streaming grew more popular and Comcast refused to upgrade its capacity, Netflix officials say. Then last February, Netflix did what Comcast wanted: It paid a still-undisclosed sum and the problem went away.\u201cThe reason I think Netflix has captured people\u2019s attention is what happened to our service was real, it was bad, and it was recent,\u201d said Corie Wright, the director of global public policy at Netflix. \u201cThey think of that buffering signal and the video that didn\u2019t start and the problems that net neutrality is supposed to solve were literally brought home.\u201dComcast officials declined to comment, citing F.C.C. deliberations, not only on net neutrality regulations but also on the company\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal.In that sense, broadband providers argue, net neutrality is a solution in search of a problem.\u201cThe public discourse on open Internet issues has now reached a fever pitch,\u201d Comcast wrote. \u201cEmotion and hyperbole are substituting for fact.\u201dInternet activists say the \u201csolution in search of a problem\u201d argument is growing thin, after the Netflix episode and other issues. And the coalition appears to be girding for a fight \u2014 and hoping to catch politicians on the wrong side of what one cable lobbyist called \u201creligion\u201d more than policy discourse.\u201cThe libertarian conservative base is pretty astute at recognizing crony capitalism and understand how campaign finance and corporate influence affects policy,\u201d said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, a net neutrality advocacy group. \u201cAnd this is a pretty transparent moment for all that.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the shifting politics around the issue of net neutrality misidentified one of the behemoth companies against which Netflix says it needs protection to keep its customers from experiencing slow Internet access. It is Time Warner Cable, not Time Warner.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Compromise and Persuasion Won Grudging Support for E.C.B. Bond Buying", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut beyond that predictable response from bastions of conservative economic orthodoxy, German political leaders reacted with restraint Friday to the European Central Bank\u2019s decision a day earlier to begin buying large quantities of eurozone governments\u2019 bonds to stimulate the region\u2019s economy.Whatever their private sentiments, Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top German policy makers held their tongues in the interests of European unity. The same was true in other countries where skepticism about the central bank\u2019s move was high, like the Netherlands.And it is not just luck, but the outcome of Draghian diplomacy.Mr. Draghi was unable to get Germany\u2019s complete buy-in on the plan, which calls for buying 1.1 trillion euros, or $1.2 trillion, of government bonds and other assets by the end of September 2016, in a bid to drive down market interest rates and encourage lending. But he did get German officials\u2019 grudging acquiescence.That was the result of months of careful persuasion, according to people with knowledge of the central bank\u2019s inner workings. It also reflects Mr. Draghi\u2019s willingness to compromise, albeit to an extent that some critics say could blunt the effectiveness of the stimulus program. By agreeing not to assume the full risk of any country\u2019s defaulting on its bonds, for example, the central bank has diluted its own power as the eurozone\u2019s ultimate financial backstop.Mr. Draghi\u2019s diplomatic outreach included a Jan. 14 visit to Ms. Merkel in Berlin. While representatives of both officials would not say what was discussed, on the basis of Ms. Merkel\u2019s statements since then, it appears that Mr. Draghi calmed some of her fears.On Friday, during a visit with the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in Florence, Ms. Merkel repeated a sentiment that she had expressed on Thursday in Davos \u2014 that the European Central Bank action should not be an excuse for eurozone leaders to slacken their own efforts to improve their countries\u2019 economic performance. Once again, she did not criticize the central bank.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Ms. Merkel\u2019s blunt-talking finance minister, on Friday also avoided criticizing the European Central Bank. The central bank\u2019s independence is more important than German objections, he said during a panel discussion here in Davos at the World Economic Forum.Even Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and a longtime critic of quantitative easing, avoided expressions of outrage that could have inflamed German taxpayers \u2014 who fear that they will pay the bill if the European Central Bank buys bonds of another eurozone country that later defaults.Mr. Weidmann, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council was one of the minority of council members who did not support the bond-buying plan, according to people involved in the discussions.In an interview published on Friday in Bild, a splashy daily newspaper that German leaders often use as a vehicle to speak to the common man, Mr. Weidmann said he feared that the Draghi program would take pressure off other European countries to overhaul their economies. Crucially, though, he did not say that bond-buying would be illegal, as he has in the past.Mr. Draghi helped defuse German opposition by agreeing to a compromise that is supposed to limit the risk to German taxpayers if a country does not pay its debts and the central bank suffers losses. Most of the risk from purchases of eurozone government bonds will, in theory, remain with the respective national central banks.Some economists say that decision undermines the idea of a single currency with strong central bank, and could weaken the credibility of the stimulus program. \u201cBefore this decision, nobody could have questioned whether monetary policy is \u2018single,\u2019 \u201d Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said in a blog post on Friday. \u201cNow, investors can rightly ask that question.\u201d The Germans were not the only ones in favor of distributing the risk. Even some members of the Governing Council in favor of quantitative easing were concerned that the central bank\u2019s bond-buying would make eurozone countries responsible for one another\u2019s debt. Mr. Draghi said at a news conference on Thursday that there was a consensus in favor of risk-sharing among the national central bank heads who sit on the Governing Council.Mr. Draghi and other members of the central bank\u2019s executive board also went on a charm offensive in Germany in recent weeks, giving interviews to local newspapers. Mr. Draghi, who has rarely said much in public about his private life, gave an interview to a German weekly newspaper in which he spoke about losing his parents as a teenager and working to support his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He told a story that seemed calculated to impress upon German readers his commitment to prudent fiscal practices. Mr. Draghi\u2019s parents left a small inheritance for the children, he told the newspaper, which disappeared \u201cinto thin air\u201d after they invested in Italian Treasury bills with a fixed interest rate during a time of high inflation.On Friday, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a French member of the six-member European Central Bank executive board, described the bond-buying program in terms designed to appeal to German fixation on inflation and following the rules. The point of quantitative easing, he said in an interview in Davos, was to push inflation \u2014 minus 0.2 percent in December \u2014 back toward the central bank\u2019s target of below, but close to, 2 percent.\u201cThere was a sense that the credibility of the institution would be challenged if we did not act to confirm our definition of price stability,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said in Davos. \u201cWe had to act.\u201dBehind the scenes in the months leading up to Thursday\u2019s action, Mr. Draghi and other top E.C.B. officials also succeeded in getting critics to tone down their rhetoric.For example, Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, a German member of the central bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel this month that she did not think conditions were yet grave enough to warrant government bond purchases. But Ms. Lautenschl\u00e4ger did not rule out supporting that option in the future, an indication she did not think that bond-buying would be a violation of the central bank\u2019s charter, as some opponents have argued.Popular opposition to quantitative easing could still build in Germany. And there could be tension among top political leaders over what some see as a failure to back up European Central Bank action with measures to improve the performance of their economies, like streamlining government approval processes for business.\u201cEurope at the moment is simply not competitive,\u201d Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said in a panel discussion in Davos on Thursday before the central bank\u2019s decision. \u201cMy big worry is that we will slow down in terms of fiscal and structural reforms.\u201dBut if Germans were upset about the European Central Bank\u2019s decision, they could take consolation in the fact that the country\u2019s benchmark DAX Index reached a new high on Thursday, after Mr. Draghi announced the plan \u2014 and then set another on Friday.\u201cWhatever is good for the eurozone economy is good for Germany,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said. \u201cThe German economy is not in a vacuum.\u201dAlison Smale contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

(The book was translated into English as \u201cMood Indigo\u201d in 1968 and more recently as \u201cFoam of the Daze,\u201d a pun on its French title.)Like many thousands of his countrymen, Mr. Gondry, born in Versailles in 1963, first read Mr. Vian\u2019s fanciful romance as an adolescent. He would seem a perfect fit for the project, having directed two wildly eccentric love stories, \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Science of Sleep\u201d (2006) in an exuberantly whimsical style well suited to Mr. Vian\u2019s quasi-surreal playfulness. \u201cMood Indigo\u201d is similarly crammed with gizmos, contraptions and cartoony riffs, not to mention animated food \u00e0 la \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d Still, opening in France in April 2013, the film attracted only a tiny fraction of the spectators who flocked to the blockbuster \u201cIron Man 3,\u201d according to the daily Le Figaro.Critical response to Mr. Gondry\u2019s 20 million-euro (about $26 million at the time) French heritage film was brutal. The leftist daily Lib\u00e9ration dismissed \u201cMood Indigo\u201d as a \u201cp\u00e9tard mollie\u201d (damp firecracker) or what my grandmother would have called a cold latke. The hip weekly Les Inrockuptibles characterized the movie as \u201cvisual cholesterol.\u201d Somewhat more sympathetic, Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma called it \u201cschizophrenic\u201d \u2014 at once off-putting and fascinating \u2014 albeit \u201ccloser to Vian than we could have ever imagined.\u201d Defenders were few when, cut by 37 minutes, the film was released in the United States in July.The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis called \u201cMood Indigo\u201d a \u201ccinematic cabinet of curiosities,\u201d akin to those of Terry Gilliam (the Czech animator Jan Svankmajer is another analog). Expectations lowered, it\u2019s a cabinet worth rummaging through in its original version, although it helps to have familiarity with the novel.\u201cMood Indigo\u201d is as generous in its use of Duke Ellington (played by August Darnell, a.k.a. Kid Creole) as it is relentless in its satire of Jean-Paul Sartre (here \u201cJean-Sol Partre\u201d), both Vian buddies. Mr. Gondry further compounds the writer\u2019s jokes and obsessions with his own. His strenuously but meticulously ramshackle movie suggests that it is being produced in a writing factory evoking the French pre-Internet service Minitel; the jumbled Paris locations make much of the new construction around Les Halles, recapitulating the urban planning of this director\u2019s childhood.More than Mr. Gondry\u2019s notions, however, \u201cMood Indigo\u201d is burdened by his production company\u2019s need to protect its investment with big names. The veteran gamin Audrey Tautou; her erstwhile co-star, Romain Duris; and Gad Elmaleh (a Moroccan Jewish comedian sometimes referred to as the French Jerry Seinfeld) are twice the age of the teenage characters they play. Omar Sy, the French-African actor who appears as the protagonist\u2019s factotum, seems younger, rather than older, than his boss. Their slick professionalism has the effect of rendering the movie emotionally inert.The original \u201cMood Indigo\u201d has many of the abridged version\u2019s flaws, but, as many cuts came from late in the movie, it is more balanced. The boy\u2019s hermetic world and then existence itself decline with the girl\u2019s illness. Ahistoricism evaporates, too: \u201cMood Indigo\u201d turns monochromatic, devolving from manic post-liberation optimism to nightmarish intimations of occupation and war.\u2018A Summer\u2019s Tale\u2019Toujours l\u2019amour continued: \u201cA Summer\u2019s Tale\u201d (1996), the third installment of Eric Rohmer\u2019s \u201cTales of the Four Seasons,\u201d had its belated United States opening in June and is now on Blu-ray and DVD from Big World Pictures.Gaspard, a diffident math student with musical aspirations, takes his vacation on the Breton coast planning to meet up with his kind-of girlfriend, L\u00e9na. While waiting, he strikes up a friendship with a pert waitress, Margot (Amanda Langlet, who 13 years before played the title character in \u201cPauline at the Beach\u201d), and contemplates an affair with another local. There is more talk than action, but much of it concerns the nature of love.I\u2019d have enjoyed learning their opinion of Boris Vian, but, as with most Rohmer characters, these young people are overwhelmingly self-preoccupied. \u201cEvery relationship is a paradoxical dialogue,\u201d the Times critic Stephen Holden wrote in his review. \u201cThe more precise and honest the characters try to be, the more they dissemble, often unknowingly.\u201dMr. Rohmer, who died at 89 in 2010, was the master of ambivalence. His creatures are sympathetic and annoying, their entanglements dull yet fascinating. \u201cA Summer\u2019s Tale\u201d is droll but not exactly funny. The leisurely flow of events culminates with L\u00e9na\u2019s unexpected appearance. Gaspard finds himself triple-booked for an excursion to the nearby island of Ouessant, which, with its rocky coast and tricky tides, is a challenge to navigate and thus a metaphor for his situation.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myanmar Returns to What Sells: Heroin ", "Date": "2015-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, valley after valley in these mist-shrouded mountains is covered with resplendent opium poppies, tended by farmers who perch on steep hillsides to harvest the plant\u2019s sticky, intoxicating sap.Growing opium poppies is illegal in Myanmar, but farmers in this remote and desperately poor region say they have few viable options.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to grow poppy our whole lives,\u201d said Sang Phae, 36, a farmer who spent nearly a decade in Thailand and returned with knowledge of modern cultivation techniques. \u201cWe know this is not good for society, and other countries don\u2019t like it. But there\u2019s no other way for us now.\u201dMyanmar remains a distant second to Afghanistan in global production of opium, the key ingredient in heroin. The United Nations estimates 550,000 acres in Afghanistan were dedicated to growing poppy last year, more than three times the area farmed in Myanmar. But Golden Triangle heroin has a reputation for superior quality and fetches much higher prices, especially in China, which appears to be the primary market.Until the 1980s, Myanmar was the world\u2019s largest supplier of heroin. Afghan production surged around the turn of the century, and supplies from the Golden Triangle plummeted when China pressured Myanmar ethnic groups along its border to stop growing poppy.But instead of disappearing, opium production migrated south, away from the Chinese border, into areas of Myanmar controlled by a patchwork of ethnic groups, some of them allied with the government, some of them hostile. Although the government controls the big towns, upland areas are the fiefs of militias and ethnic armies, and the new center of the opium-growing business.Myanmar\u2019s return to drug trafficking, which also includes a thriving trade in methamphetamine, comes as the country opens up to the world and sheds the shackles of five decades of isolation and dictatorship. With the government preoccupied with the challenges of a budding democracy, opium money is lining the pockets of officials charged with cracking down on the illegal trade.9 Photos\u201cThe government turns a blind eye,\u201d said John M. Whalen, the director of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration office in Myanmar until he retired in June. Even local government officials and military officers not directly involved in the trade are \u201cpaid to look the other way,\u201d he said.The Myanmar military, which is battling a number of ethnic armies even as the government professes peace, is wary of cracking down on drugs, fearing it could jeopardize tenuous alliances it has built with other militias, he said.\u201cYou have various militia groups that are allowed to carry on because the government needs them,\u201d said Mr. Whalen, who is now a director at Search, a Singapore-based consultancy.Here in Bang Laem, poppies are grown in the mountainous backcountry controlled by longtime adversaries of the central government, the southern faction of the Shan State Army, a group that like many other upland ethnic groups has been fighting for autonomy from the central government.Known as a \u201cblack zone,\u201d the area is beyond government control and generally off-limits to foreigners. When a team of United Nations officials and journalists entered recently, the anti-narcotic police officers escorting them stayed behind. In early December, a week before the visit, a policeman was shot in a clash with rebels, United Nations officials said.United States officials have long maintained that the Shan State Army South is involved in the drug trade, but a spokesman for the group, Sai Hla, said it was a \u201cpriority to eliminate the drug trade as much as we can.\u201dThose who accuse the group of being involved in the drug trade are \u201caiming to discredit the S.S.A. and our struggle,\u201d he said.Opium poppies have been used medicinally in this part of Myanmar for as long as anyone can remember. Small amounts of raw opium are used to treat fevers and stomach ailments, as a salve for snake bites and to treat ailing farm animals. But it was less than a decade ago that farmers took on opium as their main cash crop, abandoning cheroot tobacco, which is used for cigars.Opium is not only more profitable, but the traffickers also help finance the cultivation. The opium boom drew farmers from other parts of Myanmar, and each year migrants have cleared swaths of hillside jungle to plant more poppies.For farmers inured to conflict \u2014 almost everyone has a tale of being forced to flee the area when rival armies and militias battled \u2014 poppy has been a low-risk cash crop. It takes only four months from planting to harvest, and the bounty is portable: A year\u2019s harvest for a typical farmer would fit inside a pillowcase.\u201cFor many people in this country opium is not a problem, it\u2019s the solution \u2014 a way for small-scale farmers to increase incomes to buy salt, rice, medicines and other essentials,\u201d said Tom Kramer, a researcher with the Transnational Institute, an organization based in the Netherlands that tracks illicit drugs.Villagers here say they find themselves locked into a treacherous opium economy. Brokers come to buy the raw opium as soon as it is harvested, but villagers must also reckon with the thuggish elements of the underground economy, including countless requests for payoffs, often at gunpoint.\u201cYou can get double or triple from poppy, but you have to pay taxes to so many people,\u201d said Ba Sang Jyan, 73, a grandmother who owns a small grocery store and has an opium field in her backyard.Ms. Jyan and other villagers offer a long list of people they pay off: the police, the national army, the Shan State Army and military intelligence officers.There is no electricity in the village, no government office or police station nearby, and before this year, when the United Nations carved out a dirt road that winds up a mountainside, the only access to the village was a rutted dirt footpath.The United Nations has persuaded families here to dedicate part of their fields to coffee plants, a pilot project led by Jochen Wiese, an official with the United Nations anti-narcotics office who spent nearly three decades in Peru and started a successful crop substitution program there for farmers of coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.Crop substitution programs have failed numerous times before in Myanmar, notably with buckwheat and sugar cane, both of which were difficult to carry over dilapidated roads. Mr. Wiese says he is confident that he can make a name for Myanmar coffee and leverage his connections to make sure the coffee makes it to market.Farmers say they are willing to try cultivating coffee, which takes three years to produce beans, but are not yet ready to abandon their poppy fields.\u201cWe\u2019d love to stop producing opium as soon as possible,\u201d said Nang Wan, 23, who watched over her toddler as her husband harvested opium sap. \u201cBut if you only plant coffee, you\u2019ll have nothing to eat.\u201dIn December, Mr. Wiese spent three days answering a barrage of skeptical questions from opium farmers about coffee prices and whether he had the funds and the commitment of international donors who are helping finance the coffee program.\u201cWe won\u2019t overcome the drug problem here,\u201d Mr. Wiese said in an interview. \u201cBut you have to show people that there is a possibility to change from an illegal economy. What we are doing here is just a first step.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion\u2019s Two-Faced Relationship With Age", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the last three years at about this time \u2014 which is to say, in the nascent days of the new year, when the calendar lies clear and the sense of possibility is at its apex \u2014 Selfridges, the British department store, has dedicated its windows, all 13 of them, to a new class of Bright Young Things: dozens of up-and-coming stars of fashion and art, including names like Simone Rocha, Christopher Shannon and Maarten van der Horst, who it thinks will shape what we wear and how we shop in the year to come.New year, new generation!But this year, things look a bit different. On Thursday, the emporium will unveil its first windows of 2015, all dedicated to the work of Bright Old Things (BOTs): 14 men and women of a certain age, who changed careers late in life, moving into the worlds of fashion and art at a time most people start thinking about saying goodbye to fashionable things.\u201cIt\u2019s traditional at this time of year to focus on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s next,\u201d Linda Hewson, Selfridges\u2019 creative director and the woman behind the project, said when I called to discuss the initiative. \u201cWe decided to turn that on its head.\u201dThe young are so \u2014 well, old hat. Or so it increasingly seems.Selfridges, after all, is simply the latest member of a movement arguably commenced in 2010 by the photographer Ari Seth Cohen and his \u201cAdvanced Style\u201d blog/book/documentary series, which was quickly followed by the 2013 British documentary \u201cFabulous Fashionistas,\u201d featuring the happening wardrobes of six women with an average age of 80; the elevation of the nonagenarian Iris Apfel to icon status (she was most recently the subject of a documentary by Albert Maysles); and a river of beauty- and fashion-ad campaigns featuring \u201colder\u201d women: Charlotte Rampling (68), Helen Mirren (69), Diane Keaton (69) and (this week) Joan Didion (80).Even the 47-year-old Julia Roberts is currently the face of Givenchy, and three unnamed grandmas star in Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s new ads.But while it\u2019s one thing to pay lip (and advertising) service to the importance of the mature market, it\u2019s another thing entirely to design for it. And the truth is, catwalks are still speckled by short skirts and skinny trousers, the sheer and the sleeveless.\u201cHere\u2019s my motto,\u201d said Sue Kreitzman, 75, one of the Selfridges BOTs (and a former cookbook writer and TV personality, now an artist): \u201cDon\u2019t wear beige \u2014 it might kill you.\u201d She was referring to the lack of choice for older women when it comes to fashion. She has her clothes made for her, customized by artist friends.I remember sitting at a Bottega Veneta show a few seasons ago, watching a parade of pencil skirts and peplum sweaters, and trying to figure out why they looked so different \u2014 and then realizing it was because if I were a child, this is exactly how I would want my mother to look: elegant, streamlined, not old but grown-up. It was a surprising idea (not that such garments would be made, but that they would show up on a runway).Which speaks to a reality that the Selfridges project exposes for all to see: the fashion world\u2019s contradictory relationship with the concept of age.Because here\u2019s the thing: The BOTs range in age from women like Molly Parker, 82 (a fashion writer turned painter), to Sand Laurenson (a policewoman turned artist), who is in her 40s, which, speaking as someone in her 40s, does not seem that old. Middle-aged, sure. But old?Well, Ms. Hewson said, somewhat uncomfortably, \u201cWe really removed age from the equation.\u201dHuh?\u201cWe decided age was irrelevant \u2014 what mattered was the career change,\u201d she said. The title was just a hook to keep things consistent.The cynical response would be \u201conly in the fashion world,\u201d where the downward slope of aging occurs somewhere around 27, and the message is often a perversion of Keats\u2019s \u201cbeauty is truth\u201d lines from \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d: \u201cBeauty is youth, youth beauty; that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know.\u201dExcept it\u2019s not, because you should also know that the fashion world is largely run by older people, from designers like Karl Lagerfeld and Giorgio Armani, each in his early 80s, Ralph Lauren (75) and Donna Karan (66) to the editors Anna Wintour, Carine Roitfeld and Franca Sozzani, all in their 60s.Indeed, that world is so heavily tilted to the older generation that designers like the 36-year-olds Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler are generally known as \u201cthe boys,\u201d and the Milanese team Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi of Aquilano.Rimondi, in their mid-40s, are universally referred to as \u201cyoung designers.\u201dHere\u2019s the disconnect: On the one hand, fashion pays endless aesthetic homage to youth; on the other, it remains firmly in the thrall, and power, of the mature. Even for an industry that has made something of an art form out of holding contradictory ideas at the same time (loving both pelts and pets, for example; showing spring/summer in autumn/winter), this is hard to reconcile.Is it sheer hypocrisy? A terrible case of the Dorian Grays?Part of the problem may be that for years, from its birth in the late 19th century under Charles Frederick Worth, a.k.a. \u201cthe father of couture,\u201d high fashion was largely the province of the grown-up. It catered to women who could afford it, which implied a certain stage in life had been reached.Post-1960s, Saint Laurent and the rise of ready-to-wear and street style, all that changed. Suddenly the old names on the label had to focus on the new ones. And thus it has been ever since, forcing fashion world denizens of today, who are not oblivious to the issue, to jump through some interesting hoops.\u201cAs it relates to fashion as a whole, I think the concept of \u2018young\u2019 points to being relevant and adaptable, excited about newness,\u201d the 31-year-old designer Joseph Altuzarra said by email. \u201cAnd having fun. And I think in a way that is more a frame of mind than an age thing.\u201dThe designer Erdem Moralioglu (in his late 30s), agreed. \u201cYoung can be a 70-year-old with a cheeky smile; old can be a 21-year-old who is tired with a smirk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative.\u201dBut I\u2019m not entirely convinced. After all, at a certain point in life there is nothing relative about melting triceps \u2014 they are an incontrovertible fact \u2014 or a thickened middle or, dare I say it, back fat. They need to be taken into account.If there really is a new market class of 60- and 70- and 80-year-olds with disposable incomes and minds of their own, perhaps it\u2019s time that fashion, and designers, grappled with their needs.Some of them are beginning to. You can see it in Mr. Altuzarra\u2019s gingham suiting; the Christian Dior frock coats (admittedly, the latter were worn over board shorts, but still). \u201cI think it\u2019s changing,\u201d Ms. Kreitzman said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary.\u201dYou can\u2019t have your consumers and not cater to them, too. I, for one, am old enough to know that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying Deluxe Domestic Coast-to-Coast for Around $1,000", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayWhat\u2019s the next best thing to business class?After all, many of us can\u2019t afford it, or don\u2019t have enough frequent flier miles to upgrade. A coast-to-coast business fare can run about $2,000 or more. But let\u2019s say you can spend around half that. That\u2019s enough to buy certain comforts thanks to the advent of premium economy and new products like Mint, JetBlue\u2019s more affordable stab at business class.I recently conducted an unscientific test to see how to get the most deluxe domestic experience for around $1,000, traveling round trip between New York and Los Angeles. On one leg I flew JetBlue\u2019s Mint; on the other, Virgin America\u2019s Main Cabin Select. Would the perks be worth the splurge?\u00adMint seats start at $599 each way and include expedited screening, priority boarding, Wi-Fi, dozens of channels including DirecTV and SiriusXM Radio, food, an amenity kit, and lie-flat (up to 6 feet 8 inches long) seats. Each side of the aisle has one or two seats. The single seats are \u201csuites\u201d with doors. A door! Of course I reserved one \u2014 and it was the same price as any other seat in the Mint cabin.Before takeoff a flight attendant offered a \u201cRefreshMint\u201d: honey-infused limeade with a sprig of mint. Refreshing indeed. Were it not 5:50 in the morning, I would have said yes to the vodka version.While other passengers were boarding, an attendant showed me the suite\u2019s features: two outlets alongside a wide work space beneath the windows; a compartment for easy-access to a handbag along with a pouch for a smartphone; an illuminated water bottle holder and a reading light with different levels of brightness; a box at my feet to stow shoes; a 15-inch monitor and a \u201cglove compartment\u201d below it to stash glasses and books; a coat hook; the control panel from which I could convert the seat into a bed; and an indicator to press if I wanted to be woken for meal service. It is at this point that one begins to feel embarrassed while other passengers galumph by with their luggage. But not so embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t overcome the feeling by pushing a button with the word MASSAGE beneath it.Once in the air, the attendant slid my suite door closed. It was an introvert\u2019s dream. The seat had more privacy than my office cubicle.Given JetBlue\u2019s emphasis on low prices I did not expect high caliber amenities or service but I was surprised again and again. At one point, the flight attendant asked if I wanted anything from my bag in the overhead compartment. She brought a hot towel, a \u201csnooze kit\u201d with earplugs and a sleep mask as well as an amenity kit by Birchbox, the grooming product subscription service, that included facial cleansing wipes from La Fresh, moisturizing eye patches from Klorane, a face cream by Dr. Brandt Skincare and balm by Benefit Cosmetics.Next came the food. \u201cI have a tasting for you,\u201d said an attendant. \u201cIt\u2019s a feta cheese frittata,\u201d she added as she placed it on a shelf along with a cup of Rishi jasmine green tea.The courgette and feta frittata with harissa aioli was wonderfully spicy. How nice not to be served a bland dish at 36,000 feet. Just as I was scraping the little bowl clean the attendant returned. \u201cMay I set up your tray table?\u201dMeals on Mint are tapas-style. The brunch menu (\u201cNourishmint\u201d) features small plates by the Manhattan restaurant Saxon & Parole. My favorites: the Santa Barbara smoked salmon (configured in the shape of a blooming rose) with dill sour cream and confit shallots, and the spicy eggplant shakshuka with feta cheese.The only thing better than being given a lot of food is not being made to feel like a boar for eating it. The flight attendant leaned in and said she would be bringing over two desserts.After the fruit and the organic spiced apple cider sorbet (meh) from Blue Marble Ice Cream in Brooklyn came the food coma. Time to test the bed. The seats truly lie flat and the firmness of the air cushions is adjustable. I was able to stretch out on my back, side, even my stomach. And with my door closed, no one could see.My only quibble was with the Internet, or Fly-Fi as JetBlue calls it, which the airline\u2019s website notes is in a Beta testing phase. I was not able to get online.Later, a flight attendant handed me a cardboard cube the size of my palm. \u201cJust to say thank you for flying with us today,\u201d she said. Inside were two butter cookies and a brownie so tasty I looked up the bakery, Mah-Ze-Dahr Bakery, based in New York.This stream of little surprises made flying fun again.\u00adIt isn\u2019t fair to compare a domestic premium economy experience with Mint, a competitor to business class. For a less costly alternative, I turned to Virgin America\u2019s Main Cabin Select because, while not new or cheap, it\u2019s from an airline that trades on its particular brand of sex appeal with moody cabin lighting and touch-screens that allow for passenger-to-passenger messaging and cocktail ordering.The company\u2019s slick advertising is alluring, so the key to not being disappointed is to manage your expectations: What you are fundamentally paying for in Main Cabin Select is more legroom, and priority security and boarding, not pseudo business-class level service or amenities. I originally found a one-way fare for $398.10 which dropped as the departure time neared.As the name suggests, Main Cabin Select comprises a few rows within coach, not its own cabin. My seat had an overhead bin but no additional work space, handy compartments or amenity kit. Wi-Fi was extra, but worked. Seats reclined but did not lie-flat (again, this is not business class), and there were three across, so there was little privacy and a lot of climbing over others or being climbed over. I missed my door.The seat pitch is 38 inches \u2014 that\u2019s six inches more than the rest of the seats in the main cabin. That makes a big difference and is the primary reason to opt for these seats. As with all Virgin coach seats, there\u2019s entertainment in the form of television, movies and music and you can order food and drinks from your touch-screen. Sandwiches (free for Main Cabin Select fliers) included a Moroccan vegetarian wrap with lemon pesto pasta salad. None of the food options were warm. I could say the same about the service. For instance, when I told a flight attendant my power outlet didn\u2019t seem to be working, she didn\u2019t try to help. And when my entire row missed an announcement about not placing items in the deep seat pockets, another attendant came over and said, \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t listen to what I said.\u201d Again: Manage your expectations. You\u2019re there for the legroom.Flying Mint felt like being courted. Virgin\u2019s Main Cabin Select felt like a waning long-term relationship \u2014 the attendants on my flight (as we know it\u2019s luck of the draw) didn\u2019t try as hard. That said, Mint is a newer contender. Let\u2019s hope the romance lasts.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Abbott\u2019s approach has reassured Republicans, who control the Legislature and every top office and who argue that the Texas model has brought jobs and built a strong economy.\u201cI think basically everyone is in the honeymoon period right now,\u201d said State Representative Jimmie Don Aycock, a Republican from Killeen, in Central Texas. \u201cI think he goes in with a good track record of trying to legally defend what the Legislature\u2019s views were.\u201dBut a Democratic congressman, Representative Joaqu\u00edn Castro of San Antonio, said the start of Mr. Abbott\u2019s administration \u201cseems so far like it\u2019s more of the same.\u201dFor Texas Republicans, the inaugural ceremony was a festive occasion, marked by touches of state history, swagger and even a fighter jet flyover. Mr. Abbott took the oath of office with his left hand on a family Bible as well as a Bible believed to have belonged to Sam Houston, the first president of the Republic of Texas. The official program\u2019s front cover declared, \u201cEven the future is bigger in Texas.\u201dMr. Abbott was 26 and a recent law school graduate in 1984 when a giant oak tree weakened by a storm fell on him as he was jogging in Houston. The tree crushed his spinal cord and left him paralyzed. On Tuesday, he called his inauguration \u201chighly improbable.\u201d\u201cDuring this month 30 years ago, I laid in a hospital bed recovering from injuries that broke my back and left me forever unable to walk,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cThe journey from that Houston hospital to the Texas governorship was possible because of two powerful forces.\u201dThe first, he said, was the grace of God, and the second was Texas itself. \u201cI am living proof that we live in a state where a young man\u2019s life can literally be broken in half, and yet he can still rise up to be governor of this great state,\u201d said Mr. Abbott, who spoke at a lectern that was lowered so the crowd could see him as he sat in his wheelchair.The state remains starkly divided. With a handful of exceptions, out of the 181 members of the Legislature, most of the Democrats are either black or Hispanic, and most of the Republicans are white. Three times since 2012, federal courts have ruled that voting-related laws defended by Mr. Abbott discriminated against or disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic voters.At the lectern, Mr. Patrick took a few selfies and later repeated a statement that has become his calling card: \u201cI respect all faiths and religions, but I am a Christian first, a conservative second and a Republican third, and I praise Jesus for this moment and this day.\u201dTexas has been bolstered by tax revenues on oil and gas production and by a boom in energy-related jobs. But the sudden, steep drop in crude oil prices \u2014 from more than $100 a barrel in June to below $50 in recent days \u2014 has caused widespread concern. A senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said the collapse of oil prices could be a \u201cheadwind for the Texas economy.\u201dNeither Mr. Abbott nor Mr. Patrick referred to oil prices in their speeches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Producers Cut Rigs as Price Declines ", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 With oil prices plunging at an ever-quickening rate, producers are beginning to slash the number of drilling rigs around the country.The national rig count had remained surprisingly resilient over recent months even as oil prices dropped by more than 50 percent since June, and it still tops the count of a year ago as domestic production continues to surge.But an announcement on Wednesday by Helmerich & Payne, the giant contract rig company, that it planned to idle up to 50 rigs over the next month sent shudders through the industry. And that came on top of 11 rigs that it has already mothballed, meaning that in just a few weeks, its shale drilling activity will be reduced by about 20 percent.\u201cLow oil prices are increasingly impacting the U.S. land drilling market,\u201d the company said in a presentation to a Goldman Sachs energy conference.The announcement was an early indication that the oil industry, with its history of booms and busts, was in the early stages of its latest downturn. Energy companies drop rigs when drilling costs outpace the price they think they will attract, leading to lower production and higher prices. But until the effects ripple through the market, consumers and the broader economy will most likely enjoy the benefits of low gasoline and heating oil prices for at least the next six months, energy experts say.As for the industry, the signs of retraction are clear. The nation\u2019s rig count, a barometer of oil exploration and production activity, fell by 26 in the week that ended Jan. 2, following a drop of 16 the week before, according to the Baker Hughes service company.The cuts could eventually be felt in areas where the local economy depends on oil. Each rig represents about 100 jobs, from roughneck field hands to maintenance workers, and the current rig count is down 85, or 5 percent, from a recent peak in late 2014.\u201cDemand for rigs is falling off the cliff,\u201d said Joseph Triepke, a financial analyst and managing director of Oilpro, an industry publishing company. \u201cExploration and production budgets are down anywhere from 30 to 40 percent and the cuts are happening faster than we thought.\u201dMr. Triepke predicted that over the next six months, the big three land drilling companies \u2014 Helmerich & Payne, Nabors Industries and Patterson-UTI Energy \u2014 are \u201clikely to cut approximately 15,000 jobs out of the 50,000 people they currently employ.\u201dAlready, day rates that oil companies are willing to pay for rigs have dropped 10 percent, Helmerich & Payne said. That is a sign, analysts said, that producers are trying to squeeze costs before they cut revenue-producing output required to pay dividends and the interest on their debts.Even with the reductions, though, large-scale layoffs across the industry are not expected, at least not immediately. Producers contract their rigs for as long as three to four years, and many companies have hedges that lock in higher prices than the going market rates. In addition, producers often need to drill simply to retain their leases or keep their revenue up.Nationwide, the oil industry employs about a million people, including extraction, pipeline construction and refining, and the boom has added about 150,000 industry jobs over the last three years, according to Citi Research.Industry executives say companies are reluctant to let highly skilled workers go, especially when oil prices are likely to rebound in the next couple of years as global energy demand rises. But rig and fracking crews will inevitably be let go first, they said, since those workers can easily be rehired or replaced when drilling rebounds.Domestic oil production has increased by more than a million barrels a day in each of the last three years. But executives say they believe production may begin to slow near the end of the year as the drilling of new wells declines.On Wednesday, the global Brent benchmark dropped below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2009, before settling around $51. The American benchmark rose slightly, to around $48.But producers in some American fields are receiving far less than that. Because of a shortage of pipelines and the distance to major markets, North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale producers this month so far are selling their crude for as little as $34 a barrel.That is why oil executives say the state that rapidly emerged as the nation\u2019s second-biggest producer after Texas could suffer the biggest reversal in investment and output in the coming months.\u201cDrilling in North Dakota is very expensive and the costs are extremely high,\u201d noted Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy, an oil and gas explorer that left North Dakota a year ago to concentrate operations on South Texas. \u201cIf you are not in the middle of the sweet spot in the Bakken there is no way you are now going to risk 10 or 11 million dollars on a well.\u201dAlready companies are dropping rigs in nearby Canadian fields at a far faster rate than in the United States.There are signs almost every day that the industry is slowly reversing its breakneck drilling spree of the last six years, as exploration and production in new shale fields nearly doubled domestic production. This week, Concho Resources, a major producer in the Permian basin of West Texas, announced its 2015 exploration and production budget would be cut by a third, to $2 billion.\u201cIn the current environment, we intend to prudently manage our 2015 capital program around anticipated cash flows,\u201d said Tim Leach, Concho\u2019s chief executive, \u201cand retain significant flexibility to scale our activity up or down depending on service costs and commodity prices.\u201d Even with the cuts, Concho projects producing more oil in 2015 than last year, as do many other companies, potentially putting further pressure on oil prices.Another big Texas producer, Pioneer Natural Resources, moved on Wednesday to protect itself from the declining market by converting most of its derivative contracts to a fixed-price swap that guaranteed prices for payment.The company will receive just over $71 a barrel for 82,000 barrels a day of production. That floor price reflects the industry view that the crude price will rebound, though it may not approach the $100-a-barrel levels of last summer for the next year or two.\u201cRestaurants are still full and the traffic is still heavy around Midland,\u201d said Dexter Allred, general manager of Rusty\u2019s Oilfield Service Company, which serves the Permian Basin, referring to the West Texas oil capital. \u201cBut six months from now may be another story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Savings Rates Are Anemic, but a Survey Shows They Are Less Paltry Online", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserAmericans are not known as great savers, and a tough economy, combined with anemic interest rates on savings, haven\u2019t offered them much opportunity to change.But it\u2019s a new year, and an improving job market and plunging fuel prices may help free some cash for consumers, allowing them to set some aside in savings.So, where should you put your money? The best rates on personal savings accounts, according to a new analysis from the financial website GoBankingRates, are generally offered by online banks. Because they don\u2019t have to maintain physical branches, online banks often can offer better interest rates and charge lower fees. The site examined 120 banks \u2014 traditional ones and online-only \u2014 and compiled a list of the 10 best savings accounts, based on factors including the interest rate paid, fees charged, opening deposit requirements and the minimum balance necessary to avoid a monthly fee.Interest rates over all remain lackluster, and economists generally aren\u2019t expecting that to change much in the short term. The average A.P.Y. (annual percentage yield) for a savings account, according to GoBankingRates, is 0.17 percent. That means if you put $1,000 in a savings account and didn\u2019t make any additional deposits, you\u2019d earn $1.70 after 12 months. (The rates at the biggest banks are even lower. Bank of America is paying 0.01 percent on its regular savings account, according to its website.)Nine of the accounts on the list were online only. The exception was from Flagstar, a traditional bank in Michigan, which came in at number 10. The account\u2019s promotional 1.10 percent rate, however, is available only to customers in Michigan.The two accounts tied for the top ranking in the analysis were the GE Capital Bank\u2019s online savings account and the MySavings Account at MySavingsDirect, a division of Emigrant Savings Bank. Each is paying 1.05 percent. That rate would net $10.55 in interest on $1,000 after a year, roughly six times as much as with the average rate, although hardly a life-changing amount. (The dollar amounts become more significant, of course, if you continue contributing to the account regularly so the balance increases.) The lowest rate offered by banks on the list was 0.85 percent.Both of the top accounts have no minimum deposit requirement and no monthly fee. With interest rates so low, it\u2019s important to look at the entire account as a package, said Casey Bond, managing editor at GoBankingRates. \u201cFees are becoming more of a concern,\u201d she said, because a monthly fee can easily negate gains earned on interest.Here are some questions about shopping for savings accounts: \u25a0\u2009Is it worth moving my savings for a slight increase in the interest rate?Stephen Brobeck, executive director at the Consumer Federation of America, said rates over all were so low that in most cases moving your money might not make a big difference. Rather, consumers should focus on saving part of their income, even if it\u2019s just a small amount, regularly over time. Given paltry interest rates, they should try to save more, if they can afford it, to compensate, he said. \u201cRegardless of interest-rate swings,\u201d he said, \u201cone should keep saving.\u201d Compound interest, while not as striking in a low-rate environment, is \u201cstill a miracle,\u201d he added. \u25a0\u2009Because interest rates are so low, do I have any alternatives? \u25a0\u2009Are there any caveats to having savings accounts at online-only banks?Often, they require that you withdraw savings by transferring money electronically to an external account, such as your checking account at another bank. It usually takes a couple of days for the funds to show up, Ms. Bond said. You should check with the bank for details.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Elections, Greece Will Be in Race Against Time", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe possibility of a bank run is Greece\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.The country probably won\u2019t be forced out of the euro. But there is a scenario in which this could happen. If Syriza, the radical-left party, wins the coming election, then runs out of time before it can perform the U-turn necessary to keep its creditors happy, depositors might panic.Syriza is the clear favorite in the elections on Jan. 25. If it emerges victorious, it could be heading for a clash with its eurozone creditors. The party has promised to cut Greece\u2019s debt and increase public spending, but it will not be able to get an agreement to do this.Germany, which drives eurozone policy, is not too afraid of financial contagion if Greece defaults on its debts and quits the euro. Berlin is more worried about the political contagion if it cuts Athens too much slack. Other countries, especially France and Italy, might then go slowly with their own economic overhauls.This is not to say that Greece does not deserve some form of extra debt relief if it keeps up its overhaul efforts. Encouragingly, Syriza has promised much-needed crackdowns on tax evasion and oligarchs. The snag is that it will be politically almost impossible for its creditors to cut the headline debt level.The obvious compromise \u2014 the rough parameters of which have already been discussed between the current government and the eurozone \u2014 is to fix the interest rate at extremely low levels and extend the grace period before any of the loan has to be repaid.Could Syriza accept such an approach to the debt? Could it also agree to refrain from a spending splurge?Possibly, given enough time. But there is no doubt that it would involve a somersault, or what the Greeks call \u201ckolotoumba.\u201d Many of its activists would view this as a betrayal of everything they stand for.What is more, Syriza thinks it can play hardball. A common theory is that because Greece now has a budget surplus before counting interest rates, Athens could default unilaterally on its debt and keep the show on the road.Doing so would be a dangerous folly. While the government could indeed fund itself if it refused to pay its debt, a default could provoke panic among bank depositors. In such a scenario, the European Central Bank would no longer provide liquidity to Greek banks \u2014 making a bank run rational.Indeed, the central bank fired a warning shot last week, saying effectively that it would no longer act as a lender of last resort to the country\u2019s banks after the end of February, unless Athens secured an extension of its current bailout program, which runs out then.Greece\u2019s own central bank may still be able to supply what is known as \u201cemergency liquidity assistance\u201d if needed. But the E.C.B. would probably veto this too if a new government were not at least seriously negotiating an extension of the program.If there were a bank run without a safety net, the government\u2019s only option would be to impose capital controls. Unless it then appealed to its creditors for mercy, it would have to bring back the drachma.Athens\u2019 own finances are also stretched because it has not agreed to the latest demands of its creditors, and so it has not received the last dollop of bailout cash. Unless it can scrape together cash from somewhere, it will run out of money by the end of February.All this means that if Syriza wins the upcoming election, it will immediately be under extreme time pressure. Its first priority, to form a government, will not be easy because it is unlikely to have an overall majority. Syriza would have to secure a coalition, and its most obvious partner, the centrist To Potami movement, is adamant that it won\u2019t agree to a deal that could put Greece\u2019s membership of the euro at risk.To Potami should stick to its hard line. Among other things, this would mean insisting that Syriza ask nicely for an extension of the bailout plan. To get this, it would have to agree in broad terms to the program that it has spent years denouncing.This would require a rapid kolotoumba from Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras. That is why it is quite possible that there will be no coalition deal, and a second election will be called for late February or early March.By that stage, the heat would really be on. The end-of-February cutoff of E.C.B. support would either have passed or already be looming. Deposit flight could also have taken off, if the experience of 2012, when a bank run started between that year\u2019s two elections, is anything to go by.If there is a second election this time, the priority of the caretaker government that would run the country in the intervening period should be to ask for at least a short extension of the program until a proper government was formed.But the top priority now is for the eurozone creditors and the moderate elements in Syriza to put out feelers to one another to work out how the party could perform a kolotoumba without too much of a loss of face. The creditors should indicate that they would extend the bailout deal so long as Syriza asked for one nicely. After all, it is in nobody\u2019s interest for Greece to be driven out of the euro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aer Lingus Deal Could Spur Airline Consolidation in Europe", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European airline industry is one of the biggest in the world, on par with that of the United States. But with more than 150 carriers vying for 800 million passengers each year, Europe is also the world\u2019s most fragmented and least profitable airline market.If shareholders accept the bid, valued at 1.36 billion euros ($1.54 billion) it would be Europe\u2019s first significant airline consolidation deal in almost five years.\u201cWhile we have seen some industry consolidation in Europe, it has been a slow and painful process,\u201d said Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy Securities in Dublin. Adding a small but financially stable airline like Aer Lingus to I.A.G.\u2019s stable of carriers would provide strategic advantages to both buyer and target.The offer, of \u20ac2.55 a share, would still win the support of the two largest investors in Aer Lingus, the Irish government, which holds 25 percent, and Ryanair, the carrier based in Dublin, which owns nearly 30 percent. It would also need the blessing of the European Union antitrust authorities. But if the deal goes through, analysts say, it would be a positive sign for the European industry.\u201cFor once this is not a case where they have to do a turnaround, restructure and downsize,\u201d Mr. Furlong said. \u201cThis is an investment for growth.\u201dWhat is good for the airlines is not always best for their customers, of course \u2014 as the much greater consolidation of the United States airline industry has shown. Fewer choices for passengers tends to mean fewer, more crowded flights and the ability of airlines to reduce creature comforts while keeping fares high and adding on fees.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting very excited about flying United in economy at 95 percent load factor,\u201d said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, an aviation consulting firm based in London.That level of consolidation remains elusive in Europe, though. Many of the region\u2019s former national carriers are struggling to compete with nimbler, low-cost rivals in their home markets as well as fast-growing carriers from the Persian Gulf on lucrative long-distance routes.The bulk of Europe\u2019s scheduled services \u2014 more than 80 percent of available seats \u2014 is controlled by two dozen carriers, led by the Lufthansa Group, Ryanair and I.A.G. But in the United States, deregulation in the 1980s was followed by a series of airline failures and mergers that has reduced the field to just eight major players, with a combined market share of 95 percent.Led by Southwest and Delta Air Lines, these larger United States airline groups \u2014 many of which have recently emerged from bankruptcy \u2014 now outpace carriers in the rest of the world in terms of profit and revenue growth.\u201cEurope\u2019s perennial underperformance owes a lot to the fragmented nature of the market,\u201d said Jonathan Wober, an analyst in London at the CAPA Center for Aviation, an independent market research group.European passengers have benefited from the competition, which has helped keep a lid on ticket prices. Investments in larger airplanes have increased the number of available seats on each European flight by an average of about one-third over the last decade, Mr. Morris said, outpacing growth in demand, especially during the recent economic downturn.Europe\u2019s air travel market was deregulated in 1997. That opened the door to the creation of Pan-European discount carriers like Ryanair and easyJet, which quickly became formidable challengers, offering cheap point-to-point services to airports that were underserved by the national carriers, whose networks were structured around hubs based at major national airports.The flag carriers were slower to take advantage of the regional opportunities created by the market\u2019s liberalization. It was not until the shock of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and the sharp drop in air traffic that followed, that many of Europe\u2019s full-service carriers turned to consolidation as a means to avert financial ruin.From 2004 to 2010, three Pan-European groups emerged: Lufthansa of Germany absorbed Swiss International Airlines and Austrian Airlines; Air France merged with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; and British Airways combined with Iberia and Vueling, a Spanish discount carrier, under the umbrella of I.A.G., a holding company based in Madrid.But analysts said these mergers had largely failed to create fully integrated companies or to achieve significant cost or network synergies. Political pressure to maintain carriers \u2014 many of which are still partly state-owned \u2014 as separate brands within each group has limited the kinds of efficiency gains that would normally come with added scale.European regulators in Brussels have in some cases been wary of mergers seen as limiting consumer choice within national markets. That was the case when Ryanair made three hostile takeover attempts for Aer Lingus from 2006 to 2013, all of which were rejected by the European Commission.The consolidation that has occurred so far has delivered only limited returns to shareholders of at least two of Europe\u2019s big airline groups: Air France-KLM and the Lufthansa group have struggled to rein in costs and reduce debt since their mergers. This year, they faced new hurdles in the form of crippling labor unrest, a weak international cargo market and lower-than-expected demand on important trans-Atlantic routes. Both are expected to report sharply lower operating profits for 2014.Preoccupation with getting their own financial houses in order has limited the role that either group has been able to play in further industry consolidation. Air France-KLM turned down a chance in 2013 to absorb the struggling flag carrier Alitalia, while Lufthansa ceded a money-losing British airline it owned, British Midland International, to I.A.G. in 2012 as it began a restructuring of its core German business.I.A.G. has faced similar challenges but has managed to increase its profit in the last two years on the strength of British Airways and its ability to leverage its dominant presence at Heathrow Airport near London, where it controls more than 51 percent of all available takeoff and landing slots.Analysts said the group\u2019s relative financial strength meant that it was likely to remain one of the drivers of further consolidation, though the near-term opportunities would most likely take the form of smaller deals like that for Aer Lingus. Although the Irish airline has only slightly more than 1 percent of the European market, it offers I.A.G. a chance to expand its trans-Atlantic business through the addition of a hub at Dublin Airport.Mr. Wober, an analyst, said future acquisition targets for the group could include Finnair, with which I.A.G. already has a trans-Atlantic joint venture that also includes American Airlines. Another, he said, might be TAP Portugal, for which the Portuguese government recently solicited bids for its two-thirds stake.\u201cMergers with smaller airlines would not make a huge difference to the overall level of concentration,\u201d Mr. Wober said, \u201cbut over time, a number of these smaller deals could gradually change the landscape.\u201dThere is scope for modest consolidation, too, among Europe\u2019s low-cost carriers, Mr. Wober said. He noted that Wizz Air, a privately owned budget airline based in Budapest that operates within Eastern Europe, had revived plans for an initial share sale amid the recent drop in oil prices. If Wizz Air does issue stock, it could draw takeover interest from the likes of Ryanair or easyJet, he said.Others said the failure of the major, full-service airline groups to keep pace with the growth of the big, low-cost carriers could mean that greater market concentration in Europe is ultimately achieved via attrition, rather than acquisition.\u201cConsolidation can happen in several ways,\u201d said James Halstead, a managing partner at Aviation Strategy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a capital consolidation. It could just be just one of some not growing fast enough so that they then become acquisition targets or are so loss-making that they are shut down or sold.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece's Political Chimera", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the past few weeks, as the radical leftist party Syriza barreled toward victory in Greece\u2019s early national elections, it became a symbol both inside and outside the country: Everyone seemed to see what they wanted in the formerly marginal party that promised to reject the international bailout agreement that has kept Greece on life support for nearly five years.For a growing number of Greeks, exhausted and desperate after six years of recession and insecurity, Syriza\u2019s anti-austerity platform was seen as a promise of salvation and an effort to reclaim the country\u2019s sovereignty; others saw the impending clash with Greece\u2019s European Union partners as a deadly threat to an economy that was just beginning to show signs of growth. Many foreign observers, on the left and the right, saw Syriza\u2019s rise as a rebellion against austerity and the economic and political orthodoxy of the European Union, a revolt that could spread to other debtor nations. European Union governments, which had lent Greece money (along with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), worried that their taxpayers would foot the bill for Greece\u2019s voters and that this would inspire populist revolts in other countries. In the first days after the Jan. 25 election, Syriza remains a chimera, an unpredictable hybrid. The party is a coalition of several factions and viewpoints, with cabinet members ranging from garrulous, cosmopolitan academics to former Communist trade-unionists with limited experience of the outside world. Adding to the puzzle is the fact that the party leader, Alexis Tsipras, the new prime minister, formed a coalition with a small, extreme right-wing party \u2014 Independent Greeks \u2014 in order to hold a majority in the 300-member Parliament. This decision puzzled local supporters as well as foreign analysts. The two parties have in common their virulent opposition to the bailout agreement, and this was one more way for Mr. Tsipras to show that his pre-election rhetoric was no bluff. The government is clearly heading for a clash with Greece\u2019s partners. It is pushing for a large reduction of debt and the annulment of various structural reforms carried out (halfheartedly) by previous governments. In their first comments, new ministers have announced cuts in the privatization program and the recall of public sector employees who were laid off \u2014 canceling measures demanded by creditors. Several European leaders have reminded Athens that Greece is committed to the bailout agreement and that Europe cannot write off loans their taxpayers provided. Greece\u2019s financing expires in February, unless bailout monitors from the troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) complete an inspection suspended in November. Syriza declares that it does not recognize the troika and will deal only with European decision-making bodies. Mr. Tsipras stresses that he wants Greece to remain in the eurozone. But with Greece shut out of capital markets, and with its partners not about to give in to Syriza\u2019s demands, it is difficult to see how the economy will function if funds run out. The showdown over the bailout is extremely dangerous, and obscures many serious issues that need to be dealt with in Greece and in the European Union as a whole. Greece is the first European Union country in which a party from the political fringes has ridden a wave of popular anger against economic hardship to provide a direct challenge to policy makers in European capitals. The program of loans in return for austerity and reform has not gone according to plan and needs fixing. In turn, Greece must make a huge effort to create a viable economy that will not need further bailouts.Syriza, not being part of the political mainstream that governed Greece over the past four decades, is in a unique position to cut down on the corruption, tax evasion and inequality that plague Greece. But at the same time, the party also shares a dominant mind-set that holds back progress, such as devotion to a huge state and an economy and education system in which politics play a destructive role. Syriza represents the potential for change as well as the danger of rolling back reforms of the past few years. The \u201cmarriage\u201d with the Independent Greeks, whose 13 Parliament members are now added to Syriza\u2019s 149, reveals another aspect of Greece\u2019s politics. The smaller party represents the opposite of Syriza\u2019s liberal social platform, which includes expanded rights for immigrants, recognition of same-sex marriage, separation of church and state, and protection of human rights. Apart from their rejection of the bailout agreement \u2014 the Independent Greeks\u2019 leader, Panos Kammenos, is even more vocal than Mr. Tsipras in his attacks on Germany \u2014 the two party leaders have something else in common: Mr. Tsipras, who is 40, and Mr. Kammenos, who is 49, both cut their political teeth during years that Greece experienced unprecedented growth, stability and prosperity. As a student activist for the Communist Party, Mr. Tsipras learned that the way to get things done was by confronting authority while making maximal demands; Mr. Kammenos, the son of a wealthy businessman, entered the cocoon of mainstream politics early and was deeply embedded in the establishment, serving in a previous conservative government before forming his own party. So Syriza has chosen a coalition partner that will not temper the government\u2019s stand against its European Union partners but will probably try to outdo the leftists on rhetoric and actions. The confrontation with Greece\u2019s creditors can be seen as a clash between populism and dogma: on one side, a government that gained power by exploiting anger and despair; on the other, the creditor countries and organizations that insist on austerity even in the face of evidence that it is destroying a country and its people. But it also raises the issue of democracy, and how the rights of one nation can clash with the rights of others. If the democratically elected Greek government reneges on the country\u2019s commitment to repay its debt, this will be at the expense of taxpayers in partner countries. If the European Union pushes Greece hard for further austerity to get back the loans, this may crush the will of Greek voters. And if the European Union leaves Greece in its proud isolation, where its economy will most likely collapse, will all Greeks be forced to pay for the mistakes of a government elected by 36 percent of them (along with the less than 5 percent who voted for its partner)? Political developments in Greece now demand a serious discussion on the relationship among Europe\u2019s peoples, and on the need for reform to spring from hope, not punishment.Advertisement"}

In one tract in Utah County, 46 percent of prime-age women are not working, according to our estimates, while only 8 percent of men are not.Throughout much of New England, employment rates for prime-age women \u2014 relative to their national average \u2014 are higher than rates for prime-age men. To be clear, men in New England between the ages of 25 and 54 are more likely to be working than their female counterparts. But female employment rates in some areas exceed the national average, while male rates tend to trail the national average. Why? New England is a highly educated region, with a large number of white-collar jobs, and women nationwide now are more likely to graduate than men.New England also has a history as a center of manufacturing, which has long been male-dominated. As factories have closed in recent decades and white-collar work has expanded, women have been in a better position to take advantage. The pattern is evident in and around Boston and Burlington, Vt., but it\u2019s especially strong in New Hampshire. In the northern part of the state, the prime-age nonemployment rates are nearly identical for the sexes, both around 25 percent.The story is similar in Iowa and Minnesota, which also have a shrinking factory presence and strong educational traditions. In Jasper County, Iowa, just east of Des Moines, the nonemployment rate for prime-age women (22 percent) is actually lower than that for men (27 percent).For men, nonemployment rates tend to be higher in poorer areas. That\u2019s true for women, too \u2014 but their nonemployment rates can also be high in the richest areas.On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, about half of the women who live on the blocks adjacent to Central Park do not work. On this strip \u2014 one of the wealthiest areas of the city \u2014 the chance a woman does not work is about as high as it is in some of the poorest parts of the country.The United States is unusual among rich countries in that it ties health insurance to employment. If you were not employed (and you\u2019re not old enough for Medicare or poor enough for Medicaid), you traditionally had a hard time getting health insurance. The health law passed in 2010 tried to change this.Where West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia come together, there are numerous census tracts in which half \u2014 and sometimes even more \u2014 of both prime-age men and prime-age women are not working.Note: Margins of error are derived from estimates produced by the ACS.Source: American Community Survey, 2009-2013 estimatesYoung men work less. Older men work more. Here\u2019s what happens at every age.The work force participation of American women has declined, as it has for men. But their situation is often quite different.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Governors Face Test in Shift on Ideological Agendas", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNASHVILLE \u2014 Four years ago, a wave of new Republican governors administered shock therapy to the states they won, rolling back union rights, approving restrictions on abortion and deeply cutting taxes and spending.Republicans triumphed again in the 2014 midterm governor\u2019s races, winning re-election almost everywhere and expanding control to Democratic strongholds like Illinois and Maryland.\u201cOne of the things about being governor is when you\u2019re forced to actually balance your budget it makes people become much more pragmatic very quickly,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, who easily won re-election in November and was recently elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association.\u201cConservatives really did vote conservative, and they want the leadership to reflect that,\u201d said John Cooper, a conservative state senator in Arkansas, where a fellow Republican, Asa Hutchinson, just won the governor\u2019s race. \u201cI think Asa knows that.\u201dThe dynamic is different in each state capital, but in most the governors will probably take the lead, according to a sampling of state lawmakers and strategists. In Nevada, for example, Republicans now control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office for the first time since 1929. Gov. Brian Sandoval, who was sworn in for a second term last week in Carson City, has gained the upper hand in alliance with moderate Republicans in the Assembly against a crop of no-new-taxes conservatives.Chuck Muth, president of the conservative group Citizen Outreach, who has been critical of Mr. Sandoval and the moderate legislative leaders, said he believed, albeit somewhat reluctantly, that the 2014 elections were more a rejection of Democrats than a mandate for ambitious conservative action, as was the case in 2010.\u201cThis election was not a referendum to go crazy, though I wish it was otherwise,\u201d Mr. Muth said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough high-wire act to both be a conservative activist and push for conservative legislation and yet at the same time acknowledge that political reality.\u201dIf Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin was the quintessential Republican victor of 2010, jolting his traditionally progressive state by ending public-employee collective bargaining, no one appears poised to be this year\u2019s Scott Walker \u2014 not even Mr. Walker himself. As he mulls a run for president, Mr. Walker has said he views a so-called right-to-work bill gaining momentum in the Legislature, which would further limit unions, as a distraction. With Wisconsin facing a $2.2 billion budget gap over two years, Mr. Walker is also playing down suggestions he made a year ago to deeply slash the income tax.In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich, also thought to have presidential ambitions, wants to raise taxes on energy drilling companies to pay for an income tax cut over the objection of a Tea Party faction in the General Assembly. Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who overcame conservative objections to financial aid for Detroit, is proposing higher gasoline taxes to improve roads, an idea that is unpopular on his right.The prospect of sweeping new tax cuts \u2014 a cornerstone of Republican orthodoxy \u2014 seems to have diminished. In part that is because incumbents first elected four years ago have already enacted cuts, but Republican governors also seem to be reacting to the cautionary example of Kansas.There, Gov. Sam Brownback pushed large business and income tax cuts in 2012 and 2013, promising the loss of revenue would be made up by a business boom. Instead, revenues plummeted, the state faces a big budget shortfall, and a backlash nearly cost Mr. Brownback, a Republican, re-election.In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, who was sworn in on Tuesday, laid out an agenda that called for spending billions more on schools, the environment and transportation \u2014 a sharp departure from the $3.3 billion in education cuts in his first term, when he also turned away billions in federal aid for high-speed rail.In Arizona, the newly elected Republican governor, Doug Ducey, promised in his inauguration speech on Tuesday not to raise taxes, but omitted mention of campaign pledges to cut income taxes each year. That omission surprised few, given that the state faces a substantial and growing shortfall.Conservative lawmakers, who are still confident they can block these efforts, argue that their resistance is supported by the election results.\u201cThe November elections proved that conservatives are winning the national argument against Obamacare,\u201d said Jeremy Durham, the Republican majority whip in the Tennessee House.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising,\u201d Mr. Durham said of the governor\u2019s moderate course. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a very conservative electorate, and if he wanted to pursue conservative policies he\u2019s got the backing.\u201dConservative lawmakers may also still carry the day on some big issues by passing bills that governors reluctantly sign rather than go against their own party. That is akin to what happened with Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who positioned himself as a moderate while running for office, then signed one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bills passed by conservatives in the General Assembly in 2013.Among the Republican Party\u2019s biggest election heroes this year are the four taking over in states previously led by Democrats \u2014 Arkansas, Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts.Governor-elect Larry Hogan of Maryland, who won the most surprising upset of 2014 in a deeply Democratic state, said he had no plans \u201cto push in a conservative direction.\u201d\u201cMy election had nothing to do with partisan politics,\u201d Mr. Hogan said in an interview. He said his agenda was \u201cto fix a broken economy,\u201d which in his view includes high taxes, an unfriendly business climate and a looming budget gap.In Illinois, Governor-elect Bruce Rauner, a former finance executive who is taking over the state with the lowest credit rating in the country, has warned of difficult times ahead. \u201cI ain\u2019t going to be Mr. Popularity for a little while,\u201d he told a meeting of farmers last month.He has pledged not to restore a temporary 5 percent income tax rate that dropped to 3.75 percent on Jan. 1. The lost revenue will leave the state with a multibillion-dollar shortfall in its next budget.But in some states, the true direction a governor will take is simply a matter of speculation.In Arkansas, which will have a state government completely controlled by Republicans for the first time in over a century, many expect Governor-elect Hutchinson to proceed in the same sort of pragmatic style as his Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe.\u201cI don\u2019t see a dramatic shift in policy between the two,\u201d said Jonathan Dismang, a Republican who is the president pro tempore of the State Senate.But with Mr. Hutchinson having yet to declare a firm stance on issues like Medicaid expansion, this is only supposition. Lawmakers offering a contrary read are just as confident.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that statement at all; I see a lot of difference between the two,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, the conservative state senator. \u201cAnd I think after six months or a year, that will be pretty evident.\u201dAn article on Monday about the ideological priorities faced by Republican governors in the new legislative term described incorrectly the rail development for which Gov. Rick Scott of Florida turned away billions in federal aid. It was high-speed rail, not light rail.Campbell Robertson reported from Nashville, and Trip Gabriel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bad Data Fed the Ebola Epidemic", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe West African Ebola outbreak first hit Sierra Leone in May 2014, followed by an explosion of cases in the capital Freetown in the autumn. The epidemic now counts more than 10,500 cases across Sierra Leone, with signs that the spread is slowing.The early days of the crisis were characterized by a sense of immense fear, anxiety and alarm, regionally and globally. In Sierra Leone, a three-day, countrywide, military-led lockdown in September fed the fear in West Africa and beyond. Many flights originating in unaffected African countries were restricted. African students were prevented from attending some American schools, and there were countless reports of discrimination against Africans across the globe. Pictures of health workers in full protective suits became a ubiquitous symbol of the panic.Misleading reports, speculation and poor projections from international agencies, government ministries and the media about the Ebola outbreak exacerbated the problem. The fear that was spread by the dramatic reports that accentuated the negative, undermined confidence, made it harder to encourage people to seek care, and misdirected attention away from Sierra Leone\u2019s urban areas, where data suggest the economic effects of Ebola have been concentrated.Valid, credible and timely data is essential during a global crisis. Without reliable data, efforts to assist affected people and to rebuild damaged communities can be misdirected and inefficient.An early example of how data were presented misleadingly was the World Health Organization\u2019s choice to report from April through August that the death rate from Ebola was \u201cup to 90 percent,\u201d when the actual death rate of this outbreak from confirmed cases, even in the early days in March 2014 in Guinea, was about 70 percent \u2014 still hardly reassuring, but better than almost-certain death. Warning people of likely death is not a good way to encourage them to seek care.Both the W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention misjudged how the disease would evolve. Initially slow to appreciate the severity of the outbreak, the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. subsequently overestimated likely cases. The C.D.C. projected that up to 1.4 million people in Liberia and Sierra Leone could be infected by January 2015. (As of Jan. 27, 19,140 cases have been reported across the two countries.)Inaccurate and implausible claims about the economic impact further reduced the public\u2019s confidence, which had its own economic consequences.For example, in August, a senior Sierra Leonean government official was reported as saying his country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product had fallen by 30 percent, a figure that was implausible considering the crisis was only a few months old and that even during Sierra Leone\u2019s devastating civil war real G.D.P. fell only by an average of 5 percent a year.In October, the World Bank estimated that the costs associated with Ebola for West Africa as a whole may be as high as $32.6 billion, an estimate that was revised down this month to be at most $6 billion. When the public anticipates bad times, they cut back on discretionary purchases and save more, compounding the effects of the shock.Meanwhile, the local and international press was full of reports of skyrocketing food prices, while surveys undertaken by the International Growth Center and Innovations for Poverty Action of markets across Sierra Leone (conducted monthly from August through December 2014) showed food prices in line with previous years.One problem with doomsday scenarios is that when reliable data is finally released \u2014 as they were this month \u2014 the real figures can seem small and insignificant relative to earlier predictions.They are not. In Sierra Leone, the urban areas in particular have been badly hit. The percentage of household heads \u201cnot working in the previous week\u201d rose from 25 percent in July/August to 33 percent in November. This reduction in employment is taking place in one of the poorest countries in the world with few formal safety nets. Just over a quarter of household heads work in non-farm household enterprises in which revenues are down by 40 percent over this period, and the six-month failure rate of these businesses tripled.The informal economy is particularly vulnerable to the fear that is stoked by bad data. When the future is uncertain people cut back on small luxuries like purchasing snacks on the street or having their hair done, yet these discretionary purchases are the mainstay of the non-farm enterprise sector. This sector has also been hit badly by government restrictions on transportation, markets, bars and restaurants.Why were projections so bad? Partly because it is hard to collect good data in a crisis. But also, we believe, because dramatic headlines make for a better story. Agencies face asymmetric incentives: They are likely to face more criticism for underestimating rather than overestimating the impact of an emergency. As they scramble to raise funding for a crisis in a world grown weary of alarm calls, the temptation is to focus on the upper range of plausible estimates.But collectively focusing on worst-case scenarios can make people fatalistic, damaging efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. It also has a negative effect on the economy and makes it harder for those seeking to raise money for future crises. Independent data sources and assessments are vital to our understanding of and response to the crisis.There is real suffering in Sierra Leone today and a lot the international community can do, but we need to be clear- sighted and levelheaded about the problems if we are to help effectively.Rachel Glennerster is the executive director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT and the lead academic for the International Growth Center Sierra Leone, where Herbert M\u2019cleod is country director.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Clamps Down on Travel to and From Rebel Areas", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONETSK, Ukraine \u2014 For Larisa Horlova, a cashier, making the trip from rebel-held territory to Ukraine proper had been a routine matter, despite the shells that sometimes pounded into fields near the road as she drove. She did it every week or so to get money from her Ukrainian bank account, since A.T.M.s are no longer functioning in Donetsk.But on Wednesday, when she made the often perilous dash over pavement slicked by melting snow to a Ukrainian border outpost, she found not safety but an order to turn around and drive back.\u201cThey say I should live on the Ukrainian side, but I cannot travel back and forth,\u201d Ms. Horlova said, standing on the shoulder of the road, amid a crowd of other bewildered residents.After the Ukrainian government put in place new border restrictions in recent days \u2014 requiring a special pass that can be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain \u2014 a policy of isolating and frustrating rebel-held regions has taken a major and maddening turn.Ostensibly, the measures are needed to cut down on smuggling and to keep \u201cterrorists\u201d and smugglers from entering Ukraine from the conflict zone.But it is widely acknowledged that Ukraine\u2019s policy of isolating rebel-held zones aims to thrust onto Russia, the separatists\u2019 sponsor but a country now mired in its own economic woes, the burden of subsidizing the east, calling Russia\u2019s bluff on seeking ownership of this rust-belt region with hopes of hastening a settlement.Already, the government had cut off pensions for all those living inside the rebel-held zone, stopped paying public service salaries and sharply increased the inspection of shipments coming in and out of the area \u2014 to the point that humanitarian groups have complained that it was affecting crucial relief shipments.Since there is no banking system in the rebel areas, it is an all-cash economy. But with no functioning A.T.M.s, there is no source of cash, even for those who have money in Ukrainian banks. Until last week, people with access to transportation could venture into areas under Ukrainian control, where banks are still operating. Some were even able to apply for their pensions outside the rebel-held zone and collect their monthly stipends.But with the new Ukrainian regulations, that is much more difficult. Now, Donetsk residents must cross the dangerous area between the rebel and Ukrainian checkpoints and hand deliver paperwork to a shipping container at the Ukrainian checkpoint \u2014 then wait 10 days for a reply from officials behind the line.Residents on the Ukrainian side who want to get into rebel areas must apply at one of a handful of remote police stations and then wait 10 days.Until a decision is reached, applicants will not be allowed through Ukrainian checkpoints, said Roman Turgovets, head of the press center for Ukraine\u2019s antiterrorism operations. If applicants try to circumvent the official checkpoints, by using secondary roads, they will be treated as potentially hostile targets, he said.Meanwhile, people hoping to exit \u2014 or enter \u2014 the war zone without the permit were being turned around.Ukrainian soldiers let through only a trickle of traffic. Queues of semi-trucks, passenger buses and cars snaked out along the road from the Kurakhovo checkpoint for hundreds of yards, parked on the shoulder beside the wintry stubble of fallow sunflower fields.The road passes twitchy gunmen at a Ukrainian checkpoint where a car exploded on Monday, killing the driver and at least one soldier, in what a Ukrainian television station, Hromadske TV, reported might have been a rare if not unique instance of a suicide attack in the conflict.Those dropping off their documents had to weave past a crater, scorched automotive parts, and shoes and bloody clothing on the road.On Wednesday, rebels and the Ukrainian Army were fighting in the outlying Donetsk district of Marinka adjacent to the main road out of the city, and shells were exploding so near the road that car windows rattled.At the checkpoint itself \u2014 an exposed and dangerous place to linger \u2014 an angry crowd of Donetsk residents gathered around one sandbagged position, complaining that they had already driven the dangerous section of road, did not want to return along it and could not wait for 10 days for the permit. A soldier said he could make no exceptions.As a result of all of this, traffic between the parts of Ukraine controlled by rebels and those controlled by Kiev has dropped by almost 90 percent since the new passes went into effect, according to the Donetsk regional administration\u2019s Department of the Development of Basic Industries.At the police station in Velikaya Novoselka, a small village on the Ukrainian side of the line, hundreds of people were lined up in the bitter cold last week to apply for the new passes. Those who made their way through a crowded courtyard and up the steps into the station were able to file the papers they needed. But that allowed them only to line up at yet another building nearby, where one by one they were called inside to finish the application process.In a tiny room on the station\u2019s second floor, a group of police officials and office workers sat surrounded by tall piles of handwritten applications, desperate pleas for help.One man \u2014 Anton, a 28-year-old owner of a small trucking business whose parents live in Donetsk and who declined to give his last name for fear of jeopardizing his application \u2014 said that even after navigating this bureaucratic labyrinth, he had been told that he did not have sufficient reason to receive a pass.He said the woman taking applications told him: \u201cDo you think you are the only one here like this? Every day many people come here, they cry and beg me that they need the pass. But I refuse all of them!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Zealand Glaciers Ebb and Tour Guides Play Catch-Up", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFOX GLACIER, New Zealand \u2014 This town of about 300 residents trades on its namesake: a giant slab of ice and snow a short drive from the main street. Guided glacier hiking began here in 1928 and is a main reason for the area\u2019s popularity as a destination for international travelers.But a local tour operator, Fox Glacier Guiding, has been unable to take tourists onto the ice on foot since April, when glacial retreat caused a river to change course, blocking access to a popular hiking trail. And at another glacier about 14 miles down the road, the operator Franz Josef Glacier Guides lost hiking access in 2012, also because of retreating ice.It has, for example, hurt some ski areas while potentially benefiting competitors whose higher elevations make them less vulnerable to snowmelt, said Daniel Scott, a geographer at the University of Waterloo in Canada who studies links between climate change and tourism.In Peru, if the rapidly shrinking Pastoruri Glacier disappears, tourists may take their business \u2014 typically about $15 per person for a glacier walk \u2014 to places where glacial ice is still accessible, said Carlos Ames of Aventura Quechua, a guide company in the mountain city of Huaraz. But in the short term, he added, Pastoruri\u2019s retreat has created new jobs for horse- and mule-mounted guides, because some tourists think they cannot complete the lengthening, high-altitude glacier hike unassisted.And in Greenland, glacier-oriented tourism is growing because visitors are eager to see the effects of climate change, said Malik Milfeldt, a senior tourism consultant for Visit Greenland, a government-financed promotional company. Revenue from tourist-friendly activities like dog sledding, ice carving and Nordic skiing have dropped as winter weather has grown more unpredictable.\u201cWhat benefits one hurts the other,\u201d Mr. Milfeldt said.In New Zealand, most of whose 4.4 million people live on two main islands, tourism directly accounted for 3.7 percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March 31, 2013, or $5.7 billion at today\u2019s exchange rates, according to government data. A 2007 study prepared for Development West Coast, a nonprofit organization in the coastal town of Greymouth, estimated that glacier-related tourism on the South Island\u2019s scenic west coast directly contributed at least $77 million a year to local economies.Two of the glaciers there, Fox and Franz Josef, have advanced several times since they were first measured more than a century ago, scientific figures show. But both have retreated farther in the last five years than they advanced in the preceding 25 years, and scientists predict the retreat will continue over the long term.\u201cThere is no doubt that the retreat has been caused by climate change,\u201d Brian Anderson, a glaciologist at Victoria University in the capital of Wellington who studies both glaciers, said in an email.Since April, a hiking trail to Fox Glacier\u2019s icy terminal face has stopped a few hundred feet short of its target, blocked by a small river and some rocks and boulders that the retreating ice left behind.In a 2014 academic survey of tourism in New Zealand\u2019s glacier region, about two-thirds of respondents said they would still travel to the Fox and Franz Josef area, even if the glaciers were accessible only by air. About one-fifth, however, said they would not be willing to pay for a helicopter flight to walk on them.From a business perspective, that does not bother Bede Ward, the general manager of Glacier Explorers, which offers boat tours on a lake near the Tasman Glacier on the South Island. He said the number of his annual customers had soared in the last six years, to 25,000 from 7,000, primarily because tourists want to see icebergs break off the glacier and fall into the lake.\u201cI guess you could say global warming is having a positive effect for Glacier Explorers,\u201d Mr. Ward said by email.But at Franz Josef Glacier Guides, the number of staff members has dwindled to 35 from 60 since 2012, the year that walking access was cut off, according to Craig Buckland, the company\u2019s operations manager. Rob Jewell, the chief executive of Fox Glacier Guiding, said the loss of hiking access since April had taken a \u201csignificant\u201d toll on business.Both companies have embraced helicopter tourism in hopes of making up revenue that guided hikes once provided.Noise from glacier-bound helicopters could annoy some tourists, said Wayne Costello, an official with the Conservation Department in the town of Franz Josef. But he said tour guides could also use glacial retreat as a \u201ctouchstone\u201d for teaching tourists about climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s a really important chance for us to connect with people and say, \u2018Actually, if you value your environment, this is what\u2019s happening in the world, and these are the impacts of humans living on the planet,\u2019\u201d Mr. Costello said at his home.On a recent morning, tourists from several countries gathered at a helipad in Fox Glacier before a half-day trek on the glacier.Smitha Murthy and Keerthy Prasad, software engineers from Bangalore, India, were exploring Fox Glacier as part of their 11-day New Zealand honeymoon.After a short ride in a bright red helicopter, they were walking, wide-eyed, through a canyon with 25-foot ice walls, the newlyweds recalled after their tour.Mr. Prasad, 29, said he had planned the tour with help from a Bangalore travel agent. At over $300 per person, it was more than double what the couple had paid to bungee-jump elsewhere in New Zealand.But Mr. Prasad and Ms. Murthy, 24, had no regrets about the price.\u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not worth the money to do it again. But the first time, it\u2019s really worth it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suddenly, India Cuts Interest Rates", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 India\u2019s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark short-term interest rates Thursday morning by a quarter percentage point as steeply falling prices for oil and other commodities have helped bring inflation under control and allowed the bank to focus more on allowing faster economic growth.Raghuram G. Rajan, the central bank\u2019s chief, strongly hinted in an interview on Wednesday that the next move would be to cut interest rates, but gave no indication that he would act before the bank\u2019s next regularly scheduled review on Feb. 3.The steep fall in world oil prices since the bank\u2019s last interest rate review on Dec. 2 has been a big benefit for India, which relies almost entirely on imports for its oil and had been spending roughly $100 billion a year before oil prices plummeted. But Mr. Rajan remained cautious, saying that \u201cthe oil prices will impact us, but we have to make a judgment how long that will last.\u201dIndustrialists and some of their allies in the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been pressing for lower interest rates, even as Mr. Modi and his top allies, notably the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, have continued to back Mr. Rajan. In Wednesday\u2019s interview, in a meeting room atop the Reserve Bank\u2019s headquarters overlooking Mumbai\u2019s financial district, Mr. Rajan said several times that he was not being pressed by New Delhi to change course.\u201cI don\u2019t feel pressure \u2014 I feel I\u2019m doing what is needed, and the government trusts me with that responsibility,\u201d he said.In a news release on Thursday morning after dropping the benchmark rate to 7.75 percent, Mr. Rajan hinted at further interest rate reductions to come. He noted that when he left interest rates unchanged on Dec. 2, despite some calls even then from industrialists for a rate cut, his accompanying policy statement had said that, \u201conce the monetary policy stance shifts, subsequent policy actions will be consistent with this stance.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s government has been trying to simplify and streamline India\u2019s complex regulations for mining, land deals, large construction projects and foreign investment. Mr. Rajan\u2019s statement on Thursday indicated that if such efforts strengthened the economy and made it more efficient, further rate cuts would be more likely.\u201cKey to further easing are data that confirm continuing disinflationary pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso critical would be sustained high quality fiscal consolidation as well as steps to overcome supply constraints and assure availability of key inputs such as power, land, minerals and infrastructure.\u201dIn addition to cheaper oil, prices have fallen faster than expected for fruits and vegetables in India since September, and pressures that would increase cereals prices have ebbed, Mr. Rajan noted on Thursday morning.Chandrajit Banerjee, the director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the one of the country\u2019s biggest lobbies, said in a news release that the rate cut had \u201ccome as a positive surprise in the new year and would be a huge mood lifter for investors who have been grappling with subdued demand conditions.\u201dIndia\u2019s overnight interest rates had been far higher than those in almost any other large economy, but that was partly because India still had some inflation, even as many countries have begun worrying about deflation. But even in India, inflation has recently been below the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s targets, with consumer prices up 5 percent in December from a year earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In India, a Banker in Defense Mode", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 Few central bankers in emerging markets have been as internationally lionized as Raghuram G. Rajan of India.Mr. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has been honored with awards this winter for his role in helping to bring momentum back to the country\u2019s economy. His unexpected interest rate cut on Thursday helped strengthen emerging market stocks around the world.At home, the view is less favorable, as Mr. Rajan finds himself caught in a political struggle.The coalition of Hindu conservatives and small-business owners who form the political base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi want deeper rate cuts and other policies to help borrowers and stimulate economic growth. Mr. Rajan\u2019s critics contend that he has been so focused on reducing inflation that he has not paid enough attention to tumbling world oil prices or the heavy debt burdens of many Indian companies.\u201cHe believes the best way to reduce the temperature of a patient is to kill him,\u201d said Subramanian Swamy, the chairman of the strategic affairs committee of Mr. Modi\u2019s party and a former commerce minister and law minister.The situation reflects Mr. Rajan\u2019s bigger dilemma. At 5 percent, inflation in India is high, compared to the rest of the world. But it is low enough by India\u2019s standards that political support is splintering over further action to address the issue. While Western-trained technocrats like Mr. Rajan are still concerned about price increases, populists and businessmen in Mr. Modi\u2019s political base are not.At the same time, economic growth, which is expected to reach 6.4 percent this year, looks robust by Western standards. Even so, growth is not enough to satisfy many of Mr. Modi\u2019s backers, who promised the economy would spring forward if freed from heavy government regulation and taxation. They now want the central bank to help the process by stimulating lending.In an hourlong interview Wednesday afternoon at the Reserve Bank\u2019s headquarters overlooking Mumbai\u2019s financial district, Mr. Rajan said that he was not feeling pressure to change the direction of monetary policy. He described a harmonious working relationship with Mr. Modi\u2019s top economic policy makers. \u201cWe completely understand each other,\u201d he said.Mr. Rajan defended his decision not to lower interest rates at his last monetary policy review on Dec. 2. While oil prices had already fallen considerably by then, he said there was no way to foresee the abrupt plunge that followed, or to pass judgment on how long prices would stay low.In a news release on Thursday, Mr. Rajan made such a judgment, saying, \u201cCrude prices, barring geopolitical shocks, are expected to remain low over the year.\u201d He reduced the bank\u2019s main overnight loan rate by a quarter percent, to 7.75 percent.Despite the move, Madhav Nalapat, a Manipal University professor with close ties to the conservative wing of Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, predicted that the party\u2019s conservatives would remain deeply unhappy with Mr. Rajan, a holdover from the previous government.\u201cHe\u2019s good for Wall Street,\u201d Professor Nalapat said. \u201cHe\u2019s not good for our Main Street.\u201dThe acrimony that has greeted Mr. Rajan\u2019s slowness to reduce interest rates is symptomatic of why India in particular has tended to tolerate more inflation and of the particular challenges facing central bank leaders in emerging markets.Many companies in India are heavily indebted and are in favor of rising prices, which make it easier for them to afford fixed monthly payments.Compounding the anger is that Mr. Rajan has interpreted broadly his mandate as the country\u2019s top financial regulator as well as monetary policy maker. Mr. Rajan has repeatedly urged the country\u2019s mostly state-owned banks to step in and replace management at struggling, indebted companies, instead of waiting for them to fail and default on loans.He has also insisted that banks start requiring the founders and controlling shareholders of big companies to provide more collateral and give personal guarantees for large bank loans extended to their businesses. That has set off considerable indignation in India\u2019s business elite, which has periodically been able to persuade state-owned banks to expunge debts during hard times, sometimes while retaining their holdings in the same companies.But Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said that he had no plans to relent.\u201cIf they do take the risk, they should pay the costs of taking that risk, rather than benefit when that risk pays off but shove the cost on somebody else when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Another criticism is that Mr. Rajan did not try to reverse the rupee\u2019s steep fall against the dollar, which occurred in the summer of 2013, before he took office in September of that year. This has meant that Indians who had borrowed dollars overseas need more rupees to repay their debts. The central bank has even been intervening in currency markets in ways that tend to prevent the rupee from rising against the dollar: spending rupees to buy more dollars for its foreign exchange reserves.Mr. Rajan defended this move, saying that India needed to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves, which had been depleted during the rupee\u2019s rout in 2013. He also noted that because the rupee had been steady against the strong dollar of late, it had generally been rising this winter against most currencies.The job of governor of the Reserve Bank of India is a strange hybrid, a holdover from British colonial rule, which ended in 1947, with the checks and balances of democracy grafted on.Unlike the practice at the United States Federal Reserve and many other central banks, where interest rate changes are voted on by a committee, such decisions in India are the personal responsibility of the governor, although he may consult with others. The reserve bank also has an unusually broad array of regulatory powers, many of which are not subject to judicial review. It oversees bank licensing, bank regulation, bond trading and consumer protection.But the central bank governor has less independence, at least on paper. The governor may be dismissed and replaced by the finance minister, who may also order the governor to make an interest rate change, although the order must be issued in writing. Because either move would be highly contentious, finance ministers have refrained over the years from exercising these powers.Some conservatives around Mr. Modi want to see Mr. Rajan removed. Mr. Swamy, who was a president of the Janata Party before its merger with Mr. Modi\u2019s party, predicted on Thursday that Mr. Rajan would someday be forced to resign.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they kept him; they didn\u2019t even appoint him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was appointed by the last government.\u201dBut Mr. Swamy acknowledged that Mr. Rajan retained the strong support of the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, a longtime pillar of the New Delhi establishment. Another friend of Mr. Rajan, and his former colleague at the I.M.F., Arvind Subramanian, became the government\u2019s chief economic adviser in October.Mr. Rajan brushed away questions about political tensions sounded. He sounded wistful only once during the interview on Wednesday, when he explained why he ran half-marathons.\u201cI have never run a full marathon, and my wife will not let me run one,\u201d he said. \u201cShe says that\u2019s tempting fate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pennsylvania\u2019s Governor Breaks Through a G.O.P. Tide", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Standing outside the Capitol here \u2014 an ornate jewel wedged in the center of this recession-beaten industrial city \u2014 the businessman and political neophyte Tom Wolf told the gathered crowd this week, \u201cI\u2019m going to be an unconventional governor.\u201dActually, Mr. Wolf already is. The only person to defeat a sitting governor in the four decades that Pennsylvania has allowed its chief executive a second term, Mr. Wolf is also the only Democrat in the country who picked off a Republican governor at a time when his party\u2019s record was only slightly less calamitous than that of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Mr. Wolf says that taking on his first elected job at age 66 under tough circumstances is the natural next step of his life narrative. \u201cA $2 billion budget deficit in a perverse way excites me,\u201d he said in an interview at his sparse transition office, where a red tie sat lonely on his empty desk, as if waiting for a serious moment to leap to the neck. \u201cI am a guy who dropped out of Dartmouth to join the Peace Corps and then went back to work in a lumber company.\u201dMr. Wolf, who as governor will live in the same house in Mount Wolf, near Harrisburg, that his parents brought him to as a newborn, made his money running the Wolf Organization, a kitchen-cabinet firm owned by five generations of his family. (The town is named for the governor\u2019s great-great-grandfather.) In 2006, he and his cousins sold the business, and a bit later he became Gov. Edward G. Rendell\u2019s secretary of revenue, stepping down in late 2008 for his first run for the governor\u2019s post.He remains a wealthy man \u2014 he contributed $10 million of his $15 million primary campaign costs. His transition expenses were raised through donations from friends and family \u2014 rather than taxpayers \u2014 including himself. He is declining a salary and benefits as governor. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do this the right way,\u201d said Mr. Wolf, who also will not let his staff members accept even tiny gifts.He has no political role model, but sees leadership as a combination of management skills, creative policy thinking and deep roots to the place one serves. \u201cI look around and I don\u2019t see anybody who combines all those things,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people who are good managers and don\u2019t give a whit about the place they are trying to govern.\u201dLike nearly every other state, Pennsylvania was hit hard by the 2008 recession. But a variety of features make the state\u2019s recovery more challenging. Years of short-term fiscal bandages, like injections of tobacco-tax and stimulus funds, and deferred payments to managed-care companies, could not cover falling revenues. It is one of the few energy states that does not have an extraction tax on fracking, and it also has a flat income tax of 3.07 percent, meaning that boom times for the rich do not help the budget here as they do other states.Mr. Corbett elected not to increase Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of dollars in Washington that could have defrayed health care costs in the state. And he cut the state\u2019s capital-stock and franchise tax, lowering revenues by roughly $600 million a year. Between 2010 and 2014, 27,000 education jobs were lost in the state, among other cuts.Mr. Wolf believes a 5 percent severance tax on natural gas production could help shore up the schools. \u201cI want this industry to really work in Pennsylvania,\u201d he said. \u201cI oppose what New York did,\u201d referring to a ban by the governor there. \u201cWhat we need to do is do it right,\u201d he added.Education was the biggest issue during the campaign. \u201cI have polled for 24 years, and I could not find another gubernatorial campaign where that was the main issue,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College poll.\u201cSome of our systems,\u201d Mr. Wolf said, \u201care more segregated than before Brown v. the Board of Ed. We have to look at making our tax system fairer.\u201dPennsylvania does not currently have a set funding formula for local school districts, which underlies much of the funding inequity, education experts say.\u201cThere certainly has been a groundswell for reforming the way schools are funded in the state,\u201d said Matthew Steinberg, an assistant professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on school funding. \u201cThe heart of the debate is what that formula would look like.\u201dBut before the state addresses changes to its tax system \u2014 something Mr. Wolf said needs to be \u201cmore fair\u201d \u2014 or school funding or a new fracking tax, Republicans are almost certainly going to be looking for a pension system overhaul. \u201cThe big drama will be over those initiatives,\u201d Mr. Madonna said.\u201cWe must continue to promote fiscal responsibility,\u201d Mr. Corman said this week after Mr. Wolf\u2019s speech, and \u201censure that government lives within its means.\u201dMr. Wolf insists he can work with any form of legislature, and at least one lawmaker agrees.\u201cTom is about as rooted in Pennsylvania as you can get,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, a fellow Democrat. \u201cHe has a quiet toughness that people may not appreciate.

{"Headline": "Mexico Officially Declares Missing Students Dead", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe attorney general, Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam, delivered a detailed account of the case that did not divert much from what was previously known. Yet he went beyond hints that the students had been killed to declare that after an \u201cexhaustive, serious\u201d investigation, \u201cthe evidence allows us to determine that the students were kidnapped, killed, burned and thrown into the river.\u201dMr. Murillo Karam, in what appeared to be an effort to convince an increasingly skeptical public that investigators had solved the crime, showed photographs of charred remains, snippets of videotaped confessions and the crime scene. He also disclosed that nearly 100 people had been arrested, 39 confessions obtained and thousands of fragments of human remains recovered.Over somber music, he played a short video account of the night of the crime, based on what investigators had learned.The case has led to a series of mass protest marches, most recently on Monday, and raised doubts about the rule of law in Mexico. It has helped send President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval ratings plummeting to levels not seen by a Mexican president in two decades.The president has promised to revamp local policing and adopt measures to address widespread impunity, but analysts have said he also does not wish a security crisis to define a term that he had hoped would be devoted to improving a slowing economy and buffing Mexico\u2019s image.In a speech shortly before Mr. Murillo Karam spoke, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto suggested it was time for the nation to move on, even as the public harbors doubts.\u201cIn this sorrowful, tragic and painful moment in the history of Mexico, we can\u2019t be trapped. We can\u2019t be stuck there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to give it attention. There has to be justice. There has to be punishment for those who were responsible for these regrettable acts, but we have to take the course of continuing to assure that Mexico has a better future.\u201dThe students, from Escuela Normal Rural Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos, a rural teachers college in Ayotzinapa, about an hour\u2019s drive from Acapulco, had gone to another city, Iguala, on Sept. 26 to collect money and steal buses to use in a protest march in Mexico City. But the mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca, who has since been arrested, ordered the police to detain the students, and they were turned over to a drug gang known as Guerreros Unidos, Mr. Murillo Karam said.Mr. Murillo Karam added that no evidence had emerged to suggest that any of the students had been involved with Los Rojos.The students were rounded up and brought to a site near the dump. Some were interrogated but kept telling their abductors they were students before they were killed, Mr. Murillo Karam said.Despite the recovery of thousands of pieces of remains, a sophisticated laboratory at the University of Innsbruck in Austria that Mexico enlisted in the investigation could only positively identify one student, Alejandro Mora. The rest of the remains taken to the lab were too damaged to be identified and would need further testing, he said.Mr. Murillo Karam also addressed suggestions that the fire could not have been intense enough to destroy the bodies, saying it had been made from tires, diesel and wood and had burned for days in a ravine near the town dump of Cocula, Mexico. The ashes were then bagged and thrown into a river.Human rights groups and parents of the missing students have accused the government of being slow to investigate and of mishandling the case. The parents have vowed to continue to look for their children, and have said they mistrust the authorities and do not believe their account.Melit\u00f3n Ortega, the father of Mauricio Ortega, 17, one of the missing students, said that the parents had not been informed of the new evidence that the government presented on Tuesday.

{"Headline": "War Is Exploding Anew in Ukraine; Rebels Vow More", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA shaky cease-fire has all but vanished, with rebel leaders vowing fresh attacks. Civilians are being hit by deadly mortars at bus stops. Tanks are rumbling down snowy roads in rebel-held areas with soldiers in unmarked green uniforms sitting on their turrets, waving at bystanders \u2014 a disquieting echo of the \u201clittle green men\u201d whose appearance in Crimea opened this stubborn conflict in the spring.Instead, blaming the upsurge in violence on the Ukrainians and the rise in civilian deaths on \u201cthose who issue such criminal orders,\u201d as he did on Friday in Moscow, Mr. Putin is apparently doubling down, rather than backing down, in a conflict that is now the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan wars.With the appearance in recent weeks of what NATO calls sophisticated Russian weapons systems, newly emboldened separatist leaders have abandoned all talk of a cease-fire. One of the top leaders of the Russian-backed rebels said Friday that his soldiers were \u201con the offensive\u201d in several sectors, capitalizing on their capture of the Donetsk airport the day before.\u201cWe will attack\u201d until the Ukrainian Army is driven from the border of the Donetsk region, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic rebel group, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.\u201cOn our side, we won\u2019t make an effort to talk about a cease-fire,\u201d Mr. Zakharchenko said. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to watch how Kiev reacts. Kiev doesn\u2019t understand that we can attack in three directions at once.\u201d\u201cIt was pure illusion that peace could be achieved now,\u201d said Enrique Menendez, a former advertising agency owner who now runs a humanitarian relief operation in eastern Ukraine. \u201cNone of the sides has yet achieved its goals. The only real surprise is that the fighting started in the winter instead of the spring.\u201dWhile the separatist forces now seem ascendant, analysts have little doubt that their fortunes are tied to the level of support provided by Moscow. In August, on the verge of defeat, they were rescued by an all-out Russian incursion that turned the tide on the battlefield and drove Kiev to the bargaining table. The same dynamics appear to be at work now, Ukraine and NATO say, with Russian troops in unmarked uniforms apparently joining the separatists in the assaults on Ukrainian positions.While Moscow denies any role in the fighting, Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin, says it is not surprising that Mr. Putin has continued to support the rebellious republics of southeast Ukraine even in the face of economic pressure from the West. In fact, the intensity of the standoff, he said, has undermined the influence of Mr. Putin\u2019s liberal economic advisers in government, rendering their voices almost mute in debates over Ukraine.Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, echoed that point. \u201cThe influence of economists as a whole has completely vanished,\u201d Mr. Sonin said of the Kremlin. \u201cThe country is on a holy mission. It\u2019s at war with the United States, so why would you bother about the small battleground, the economy?\u201dMr. Putin is said to watch his approval ratings closely, and they have risen to great heights recently with the annexation of Crimea and the tensions with the West over eastern Ukraine. In this respect, said Igor Shuvalov, a first deputy prime minister of Russia, continued fighting in Ukraine may actually help to solidify Mr. Putin politically at a time of deteriorating economic conditions.\u201cWhen a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader,\u201d Mr. Shuvalov said Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cWe will survive any hardship in the country, eat less food, use less electricity.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Markov said, the stresses of juggling a war and the deepening economic crisis in Russia have left Mr. Putin noticeably preoccupied,\u201cWe have much less time than before,\u201d he said of a recent meeting between experts and Mr. Putin in which he participated. \u201cIt was clear to me that the thoughts of Mr. Putin were somewhere else, but not in our room.\u201dThe slow grind of combat in southeastern Ukraine that began in April has now killed at least 5,086 soldiers and civilians, the United Nations reported on Friday. The world body bases its estimate on official morgue and hospital reports, and analysts believe that it understates the total death toll. The report said that 262 of the deaths occurred in the past nine days, making that period the deadliest since the September cease-fire.Signs of the new belligerence were evident across eastern Ukraine on Friday.Indeed, fighting has also flared beyond Donetsk, including a road and rail hub northeast of the city, as well as a strategic checkpoint near Luhansk, the other main rebel stronghold. Rebel commanders claimed on Friday to have captured the village of Krasny Partizan, north of Donetsk, which would be another setback for government forces.In another worrisome sign, the rebels were not the only ones taking a more aggressive tone.Speaking to security officials in Kiev after the loss of Donetsk airport, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine expressed frustration with the broken peace process.\u201cIf the enemy does not want to abide by the cease-fire, if the enemy doesn\u2019t want to stop the suffering of innocent people in Ukrainian villages and towns, we will give it to them in the teeth,\u201d he said.Any major offensive by either side would clearly be a repudiation of the cease-fire signed on Sept. 5 and endorsed by the group\u2019s main sponsor, Russia. That agreement, always shaky, began to break down several weeks ago. It had set the de facto borders of the rebel republic to encompass about one-third of the Donetsk region of Ukraine.Mr. Zakharchenko has threatened to expand his territory before, but his warnings have not typically prompted much alarm. Now, with the war raging and his troops on the march, more attention is being paid.As recently as a few weeks ago, peace seemed to be slowly seeping into the blood-soaked fields of eastern Ukraine. Russia seemed occupied with the drop in oil prices and the ruble\u2019s collapse. The shaky cease-fire was holding. Language on both sides was noticeably more conciliatory.That all seems a long time ago now on the war-rattled streets of Donetsk, where a main hospital was hit by a shell this week.If one were to ask the remaining residents of Donetsk, even those who have been loyal to the Kiev government, whether they supported this new rebel advance, they would say yes, Mr. Menendez said \u2014 and not necessarily for political reasons.\u201cThey just want to push the front lines out of the city,\u201d he said, \u201cto stop the shelling on them.\u201dDavid M. Herszenhorn and Andrew Roth contributed reporting from Moscow, and Alison Smale from Davos, Switzerland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strikes by Taxi Drivers Spread Across China ", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly in the week, hundreds of drivers in the northeastern rust-belt city of Changchun blocked roads, prompting the intervention of police officers, who arrested scores of drivers, according to social media postings that were later deleted by censors.Cabbies in other cities, including Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, and Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, also took part in organized work stoppages.Last week, a two-day strike in Nanjing, a prosperous city in the Yangtze River delta, left thousands of people scrambling to find alternate transportation at the city\u2019s airport, train stations and bus terminals.Although taxi strikes in China are not new, the cascade of copycat protests around the country highlights the organizational power of social media, presenting a challenge to a government that has little tolerance for labor unrest.The group said the increase in protests and strikes by truck drivers, construction workers and miners was probably because of a slowing economy, but also because of the spread of inexpensive smartphones that have allowed organizers to spread the word about unpaid wages, broken contracts and other labor complaints.Cabdrivers in China have long complained about low wages and long days, but the recent strikes appear to have also been fueled by the spread of ride-hailing apps like Uber and a flurry of news media attention to what many drivers say is unfair competition.Uber drivers in a number of Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Chongqing, have been fined in recent weeks, but the service remains widely available. Huang Min, a spokeswoman for Uber in China, said the company had not been contacted by the authorities.Geoffrey Crothall of China Labor Bulletin said the news media\u2019s focus on ride-hailing apps obscured the main complaint of the Chinese taxi drivers: that rapacious fleet companies charge onerous rental fees that leave drivers with little to show for their work. \u201cDrivers are basically held hostage to the companies, and they are constantly getting squeezed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the discussion of these apps seems to have encouraged taxi drivers to press their case and try to draw attention to their longstanding grievances.\u201dThe strikes seem to be having the desired effect, and a number of newspapers have recently published commentaries supporting the drivers. In an editorial published on Jan. 6, the official People\u2019s Daily described the current system as \u201cdeformed\u201d and called for an end to the monopoly enjoyed by cab companies, many of which are owned by well-connected businessmen. \u201cThe drivers are in an absolutely weak position,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reform the taxi system. The matters of the market should be left for the market to decide.\u201dShanshan Wang contributed reporting, and Mia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Case for Killing the Medical Device Tax", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe health reform law imposes a modest 2.3 percent tax on sales of medical devices, to be paid by the manufacturers or importers. It applies to such products as X-ray machines, M.R.I. scanners, pacemakers and artificial hip and knee joints but not to eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids. The $29 billion to be raised from the device industry is less than the amounts to be raised from insurers and drug companies, all of which will benefit from increased business under the act and should pay their fair shares of the cost. If the lost revenues from a repeal of the device tax are offset by reduced spending on other health care programs, as they might well be, many patients could suffer medical or financial harm.Trade groups say the tax has already caused a big loss of jobs, has reduced spending on research and will lead to a total loss of 195,000 jobs among manufacturers and suppliers and in the general economy over the next five years. They also say the tax will stifle innovation, drive up health care costs and provide an incentive for manufacturers to locate facilities overseas.Independent analysts believe the industry\u2019s dire forecasts are malarkey. The Congressional Research Service estimated that the tax would have \u201crelatively modest\u201d effects on jobs, research and company profits and a \u201cnegligible\u201d effect on the price of health care. Some jobs would be lost, but they account for a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the industry\u2019s work force. The C.R.S. said the tax should not affect decisions on where to locate production facilities because domestically produced devices and imported devices are subject to the same tax. Some parts of the industry are thriving. In Warsaw, Ind., which bills itself as the \u201cOrthopedic Capital of the World,\u201d demand for artificial hips and knees and other orthopedic devices appears to be growing and companies are scrambling to hire more people.Bills to repeal the tax were introduced in both chambers of Congress this month. Apart from its immediate harm, repealing the tax could trigger a rush by other health care interests to repeal the taxes and fees that apply to them, thereby increasing budget deficits or requiring painful cuts in health care programs.

The euro briefly dropped to $1.1098, its lowest level since 2003.Stocks in Athens fell 3.6 percent.The election result was largely in line with analysts\u2019 predictions, and investors had had weeks to adjust their portfolios to reflect the possibility that a showdown over the future of Greece\u2019s economic direction was near, pitting Athens against Brussels.The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the prospects for global growth were dimming \u2014 with the notable exception of the United States \u2014 raising the specter of a slowdown that would exacerbate the problems of low-price pressures and growing inequality.Derek Halpenny, the European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London, said in a research note that he did not expect the change in Athens to create \u201cexistential risks\u201d to the euro, or for strong euro-selling pressures to emerge in the short term.But Mr. Halpenny said that there were \u201ccertainly increased risks, and an error in the negotiating stage could mean this becomes a bigger negative for the market.\u201dEuropean bonds, whose prices had been rising for months in anticipation of the European Central Bank\u2019s move last week to stimulate the economy, showed little movement on Monday.Greek bond prices fell amid the postelection uncertainty, sending their yields higher, to 8.70 percent \u2014 the highest in the eurozone. Yields reached a recent peak of 10.3 percent on Jan. 7, when pre-election jitters were strongest.Perhaps the biggest question for financial markets is what the Syriza victory will mean for Greek bonds, particularly in light of the plan announced by Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, last week. The central bank plans to buy up a significant part of the bonds issued by each of the 19 eurozone governments, something that could bring substantial relief to the Athens government\u2019s borrowing costs.But Mr. Draghi noted at a news conference on Thursday that, \u201cThere are obviously some conditions before we can buy Greek bonds,\u201d including that the Greek government honor its bailout program.If Athens meets the conditions, the European Central Bank \u201ccould buy bonds in, I believe, July,\u201d Mr. Draghi added.The German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which often reflects the opinion of the business community, stated in an initial analysis: \u201cTsipras will not be able to escape one fact: Greece needs more foreign money, whether from the markets or from the European Union. He has a choice between compromises with the troika and a huge state bankruptcy that could lead his country further into the abyss.\u201dChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in an interview posted on the website of the French daily Le Monde on Monday that Greece still had to honor pledges it made as part of a bailout plan.Athens committed to overhaul government administration and tax collection, and to reduce delays in the legal system, Ms. Lagarde said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t austerity measures, these are fundamental reforms that remain to be carried out,\u201d she said.Asked by Le Monde about Mr. Tsipras\u2019s pledge to restructure Greece\u2019s debt, Ms. Lagarde responded that there were \u201cinternal rules of the eurozone to be respected.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t make special categories for this or that country,\u201d she said.Asian stocks were mixed, with major indexes in Tokyo falling about 0.3 percent and Hong Kong shares rising 0.2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Rule the Oil Market? ", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 A HISTORIC change of roles is at the heart of the clamor and turmoil over the collapse of oil prices, which have plummeted by 50 percent since September. For decades, Saudi Arabia, backed by the Persian Gulf emirates, was described as the \u201cswing producer.\u201d With its immense production capacity, it could raise or lower its output to help the global market adjust to shortages or surpluses. But on Nov. 27, at the OPEC meeting in Vienna, Saudi Arabia effectively resigned from that role and OPEC handed over all responsibility for oil prices to the market, which the Saudi oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, predicted would \u201cstabilize itself eventually.\u201d OPEC\u2019s decision was hardly unanimous. Venezuela and Iran, their economies in deep trouble, lobbied hard for production cutbacks, to no avail. Afterward, Iran accused Saudi Arabia of waging an \u201coil war\u201d and being part of a \u201cplot\u201d against it.By leaving oil prices to the market, Saudi Arabia and the emirates also passed the responsibility as de facto swing producer to a country that hardly expected it \u2014 the United States. This approach is expected to continue with the accession of the new Saudi king, Salman, following the death on Friday of King Abdullah. And it means that changes in American production will now, along with that of Persian Gulf producers, also have a major influence on global oil prices.America was once, by far, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and exporter, and its swing producer. The Texas Railroad Commission determined \u201callowable\u201d levels of production for Texas, the Saudi Arabia of the day. But by 1970, United States oil production had reached its high point of 9.6 million barrels per day and began to decline. The United States began to import more and more oil. By 2008, its own oil production was down almost 50 percent from the high point. Oil prices reached $147 a barrel, and fears that the world\u2019s oil production had peaked and that we were beginning to run out of oil had become pervasive.Quietly, though, an unconventional oil and gas revolution was beginning to pick up speed in the United States. It yoked together two technologies: hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. The impact was measured first in the rapidly growing production of shale gas, which now makes up about half of total American gas. This \u201cshale gale\u201d catapulted the United States ahead of Russia to become the world\u2019s No. 1 gas producer.Then around 2010, the same technologies started to be seriously applied to the search for oil. The results were phenomenal. By the end of 2014, oil production in the United States was 80 percent higher than it had been in 2008. The increase of 4.1 million barrels per day was greater than the output of every single OPEC country but Saudi Arabia. Today, American output is almost back to where it was in 1970. On top of that was a million-barrel-a-day gain since 2008 from the Canadian oil sands. The chimera of \u201cenergy independence\u201d began to look more tangible, at least for North America.This revolution also turned out to be a big boost for the American economy, creating jobs, improving the country\u2019s competitive position and drawing in over a $100 billion of new investment. Only rarely has the global oil market seen production increases on this scale this fast. The last time was in the early 1980s, when new supplies from Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska created an oil surplus that led to a price crash.This time, several things postponed a price collapse. One was the growing consumption in the developing world, led by China. Another was turmoil in Libya, South Sudan and other countries that reduced supply. Over a million barrels per day were also taken off the market by sanctions imposed on Iran. Without that big surge of shale oil from the United States, it is highly likely that those sanctions would have failed. Prices would have spiked, countries seeking cheaper oil would have broken ranks \u2014 and Iran might not be at the nuclear negotiating table today.By the middle of last summer, however, circumstances changed. World economic growth was slowing. Europe was on its back. Since 2004, China\u2019s rapidly rising demand for oil had been the defining factor for the global oil market. But China\u2019s economy was slowing, too, and that meant slowing growth in oil demand. At the same time, Libya managed to quadruple its oil output, at least for a time. That was the trigger for the beginning of the price decline.It was assumed that OPEC would step in and cut production to boost the price. Trillions of dollars of investment have been made over the last several years on that premise. But Saudi Arabia and the other gulf countries declined to do so. If they reduced production, they reasoned, they would lose market share permanently. As they saw it, they would be cutting back on their \u201clow cost oil\u201d to make room for \u201chigh cost oil,\u201d and then would have to make more cuts to accommodate more high cost oil.They were looking at competition not only from American shale oil but also from Canadian oil sands and new supplies from Russia, the Arctic, Brazil, Central Asia, Africa and growing volumes of offshore oil around the world. But, most immediately, they were looking at two neighbors. They did not want to give up markets to Iraq, a country they see as an Iranian satellite, and whose output is increasing. And they certainly did not want to make way for Iran, which they thought might come to a nuclear deal with the United States and its allies, bringing that missing Iranian oil back into the market.The depth of the price fall may be much more than even some of the gulf producers anticipated. Around the world, oil companies are cutting budgets, paring costs, slowing down projects and postponing new ones. Some may end up being canceled.Saudi Arabia is hoping that lower oil prices will stimulate economic growth and demand for oil. In the meantime, with their large holdings of foreign reserves, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf emirates can afford to wait. That is not true for many of the other oil exporters. Venezuela is highly vulnerable to turmoil and even financial collapse. Russia is coping not only with lower prices for oil, which provides over 40 percent of government revenues, but with Ukraine-related sanctions, and seems headed into a deep recession.Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa and the continent\u2019s most populous nation, is also at risk. The oil sector represents 95 percent of export earnings and 75 percent of government revenues. And its revenues are falling as it needs more money to fight the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency.Over all, the fall in oil prices could mean a $1.5 to $2 trillion transfer from oil-exporting countries to oil-importing countries. Japan will be a big beneficiary. So will China. American consumers will benefit, too, though it will also mean that fewer oil wells will be drilled here, more rigs will be laid up and increasing numbers of workers will be let go.American shale oil has become the decisive new factor in the world oil market in a way that could not have been imagined five years ago. It has proved to be a truly disruptive technology. But will that impact continue in a world of low prices?Oil is now below $50 a barrel, a price too low for a good deal of the new shale oil development to make economic sense. Yet output is likely to continue to rise by another 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2015 because of sheer momentum and commitments already made.Come the middle of the year, however, growth will flatten out. Producers will work hard to improve efficiency and lower costs, but in 2016, at these prices, American output could decline. Production elsewhere in the world will also be flattening. But by then, the world economy might be doing better, stimulating oil demand. Prices could start rising again. If the gulf producers have their way, prices will not go back to $100 a barrel. Even at prices well below $100, American shale oil producers will find ways to drive down costs and output will start rising again. And the world\u2019s new swing producer will find itself back in the swing of things.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racial Isolation in Public Schools", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis is not an easy problem to solve. But the state cannot just throw up its hands. It has a moral obligation to ensure that as many children as possible escape failing schools for ones that give them a fighting chance. And history has shown that districts can dramatically improve educational opportunities for minority children \u2014 and reduce racial isolation \u2014 with voluntary transfer plans and especially with high-quality magnet schools that attract middle-class families.This problem is especially urgent in New York\u2019s second-largest city, Buffalo, where federal civil rights officials are enforcing an agreement intended to expand minority access to the better schools in a dysfunctional system, which has suffered from years of abysmal leadership and middle-class flight. Today nearly half the city\u2019s public schools either have low graduation rates or rank in the bottom 5 percent of state schools in math and English. The United States Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights began its investigation of charges that the district was discriminating against nonwhite students in admissions to the better schools \u2014 those that choose students based on test scores and other screening. As part of a sweeping resolution agreement with the federal government, the district hired a consultant who is studying the system with the aim of addressing \u201cthe root causes\u201d of racial disparities in enrollment and admission rates at the special admission schools \u2014 known in Buffalo as \u201ccriteria schools.\u201d Among other things, this means going back to earlier grades to determine why children might not be getting the guidance, courses and information they need to gain access or admission to the criteria schools. The district did re-evaluate the applications of the children whose families filed the complaint and admitted those who were eligible, providing help and support where necessary.One obvious step would be for Buffalo to expand seats in its eight criteria schools so that more children can benefit. But the federal civil rights agreement does not address the school system as a whole, which is still shortchanging minority children.The irony of the Buffalo situation is that during the 1970s the city made great progress in addressing racial isolation in its schools. A court-ordered desegregation plan pushed Buffalo to create a much sought after system of magnet schools that improved prospects for poor children and attracted large numbers of middle-class families. The magnet schools that had been so popular were scaled back, alienating middle-class families once again. The decision to dismantle the model system, in other words, was a disastrous mistake. More recently, the Buffalo school system has been hobbled by a wasteful, outmoded teachers\u2019 contract that provides unusually generous benefits and makes it difficult to manage the teaching force. The district has also suffered from inept leadership that has not met basic obligations. It has failed, for example, to file acceptable, legally required plans with the state for turning around low-performing schools. This week, The Buffalo News raised troubling questions about the accounting for funds earmarked for rebuilding the city\u2019s crumbling schools. The Cuomo administration alluded to the chronic problems in the Buffalo schools last month when it asked the Board of Regents what should be done about their \u201cdeplorable conditions.\u201d Support appears to be growing for laws giving the state more authority to force policy changes on failing districts and to even appoint receivers to run day-to-day operations, which may be necessary in Buffalo.

{"Headline": "Senate to Debate Keystone XL, Setting Stage for More Energy Battles", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the bill\u2019s fate appears certain: Republicans, with the help of some Democrats, are expected to easily push it through Congress, and Mr. Obama is expected to veto it.The floor debate, which is scheduled to play out in the next two to three weeks, will serve as a showcase for various energy and environmental issues and is expected to involve votes on the science of climate change and humanity\u2019s role in causing it, as well as on a proposal to lift a 42-year-old ban on exporting crude oil.The debate will also provide potential presidential candidates with a platform for promoting their own energy policies. Senators are expected to debate amendments on dozens of other energy issues like subsidizing heating bills for poor people, increasing taxes on oil production, and promoting renewable energy. It has been eight years since the Senate held a similar debate before passage of an energy bill.\u201cI know senators from both sides are hungry for a real Senate debate,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an open floor debate on jobs, the middle class, infrastructure and energy.\u201dArguments over energy issues have changed drastically since the passage of the 2007 law.At the time, lawmakers worried about increased dependence on imported oil, but the United States is now on track to become the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. Energy companies, in turn, have campaigned aggressively to lift the ban on crude oil exports that was imposed after the crippling 1973 Arab oil embargo.At the same time, a growing number of scientific reports have concluded that climate changes caused by the burning of fossil fuels have begun to harm the global economy. Mr. Obama has proposed a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on power plants and cars in an effort to curb greenhouse gas pollution, but Republicans have said the rules would force employers to eliminate jobs.Both issues \u2014 how the United States responds to the oil boom and to climate change \u2014 will be top priorities for the next president.The Keystone fight, in particular, lawmakers from both parties said, is likely to be a Senate referendum on climate change. Democrats have criticized those Republicans who question that humans are causing global warming, which almost all scientists believe. The issue has divided Republicans, with conservatives openly questioning the science behind that conclusion and moderates trying to avoid it. Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, will introduce a resolution declaring that climate change caused by humans is a major threat.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be forgotten by history,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who is considering a 2016 campaign for president as a progressive. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be asking: Did you not hear what the scientific community all over the world is saying \u2014 that climate change is the most serious environmental crisis facing this planet?\u201dDemocrats are expected to attack Republicans who vote against the resolution as science deniers \u2014 an accusation that could resonate into 2016.A group of liberal Democrats who have made climate change their priority \u2014 including Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico \u2014 are also expected to propose climate change amendments during the Keystone debate. And Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has openly spoken of the climate-change threat, said he might introduce a resolution of his own. On the Republican side, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is frequently mentioned as a possible presidential candidate next year, is expected to offer amendments of his own that would lift the oil export ban and speed approval of export permits for liquid natural gas. \u201cA booming new energy economy can also provide critical resources to our allies so they are no longer energy-dependent on petro-tyrants such as Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin,\u201d Mr. Cruz said last year. \u201cThe only thing the federal government needs to do is get out of the way and let Americans do what they do best: dream, innovate and prosper.\u201dEven if Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal does not make it into the final bill, Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is preparing a separate bill aimed at promoting domestic oil and gas exports.Democrats, led by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, will counter with an amendment requiring that any oil shipped through the Keystone pipeline remain in the United States. There is some bipartisan agreement on energy issues. Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, will introduce a Keystone amendment that would improve energy efficiency in buildings. The measure, though modest, has drawn strong support from both parties. That amendment would die with the president\u2019s veto of the Keystone bill, but it could return as a stand-alone measure bill later this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Truck Sales Surge in U.S., Toyota and Nissan Unveil Upgrades", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Rock music shook the room as the gleaming blue pickup drove up behind Toyota\u2019s top American executive, William D. Fay. Mr. Fay left no doubt about his delight with the redesigned Tacoma, enthusiastically telling reporters at the North American International Auto Show here that he hoped the truck would \u201cset the benchmark\u201d for midsize pickups 20 years after it first came to America. Mr. Fay might as well have been talking about pickups as a whole. The industry is coming off one of the most successful years for pickups in recent memory as an improving economy and low gas prices led to a surge in truck sales around the United States. Whether it was for work or play, more buyers visited truck showrooms in 2014 than ever.But while the market for trucks had traditionally been the bread and butter of America\u2019s Big 3 automakers, on Monday Japanese automakers were determined to make their mark: Both Nissan and Toyota introduced powerful, rugged trucks aimed at capturing a greater share from General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.Nissan is targeting the lucrative full-size truck segment by putting a beast of a diesel engine into its aptly named Titan. The company\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said that the 5.0-liter V-8 engine \u2014 capable of towing 12,000 pounds \u2014 was not best-in-class so much as \u201cbest new class.\u201dThe current diesel-powered champion, Chrysler\u2019s Ram pickup, had record sales in 2014, and full-size trucks across the board surged ahead. For most vehicles, automakers increased the usual discounts and deals over what they offered last year. But for full-size trucks such incentives actually went down by nearly 13 percent, according to data from Kelley Blue Book.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s American competition greeted the new competition with equanimity.Robert Hegbloom, head of the Ram brand, said in an interview on Monday that Nissan was trying to stretch its light-duty truck into meeting the demands of two types of buyers.He said he felt comfortable with the progression of trucks Ram offered \u2014 starting with its light truck, the 1500, and then for those seeking more commercial-grade power, the heavier-duty 2500 and 3500. He said Nissan did not have anything to match the 2500. \u201cLight-duty customers look for fuel economy,\u201d Mr. Hegbloom said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll want to sacrifice that for the towing power of a heavy-duty truck they don\u2019t need.\u201dToyota had already done well in the midsize-truck category, partly because the segment had until recently been all but abandoned by other automakers. But new competition \u2014 from the Chevrolet Colorado, for example \u2014 meant Toyota needed an upgrade for the Tacoma, a model first introduced in 1995.Mr. Fay said on Monday that Toyota would add a third shift at its Tacoma plant in Mexico to increase production of the new model. But he acknowledged that when it came to overall pickup truck sales, Toyota would probably remain in more of a niche compared with American trucks. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to chase the Silverado or F-150 anytime soon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think the combination of the two trucks provides us a very competitive entry into nearly 300,000 consumers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Secret Basement Sessions", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe narrow space has industrial gray carpeting and exposed pipes. There\u2019s room for a drum kit, a couple of amps, a table holding a mixer and keyboard, a couch. A few guitars sit on an overhead rack. Names of songs are written in erasable marker on a beige wall panel. It\u2019s more work space than hangout, and not particularly cozy \u2014 just another rehearsal room.But this happens to be the one that secretly incubated the reunion of a band that had been sorely missed in indie-rock since 2006: Sleater-Kinney. \u201cIn here,\u201d Ms. Brownstein said, \u201cit always seemed dark and insular, like we were assembling explosive devices and then wondering how and where they\u2019ll detonate, and how big the explosion will be.\u201d\u201cIt was good that we wrote it in secret and that we didn\u2019t have to worry about what other people thought,\u201d Ms. Tucker said over lunch at a downtown Portland bowling alley. \u201cBut we also didn\u2019t have anyone else\u2019s input. We just knew what we wanted to make ourselves happy. There are no slow songs on the record, and we didn\u2019t plan that. But we were like a horse that was in its stable, ready to go \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re in this band again, Oh my God!\u2019\u00a0\u201dIn the 1990s Ms. Brownstein and Ms. Tucker were students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., amid the punk-feminist ferment of the riot grrrl movement. They both had other bands, but they found synergy when they started writing songs together in 1994. (They used a rehearsal studio on Sleater Kinney Road in nearby Lacey, Wash.) Their music grew more and more unorthodox, moving from the brute-force stomp and blare of punk toward a fiercely convoluted three-way counterpoint of guitars and drums, simultaneously combative and interlocking, full of what Mr. Goodmanson called, admiringly, \u201ccrazy tangle-note guitar stuff.\u201dSleater-Kinney songs often have the two guitars chasing each other along jagged trajectories, wrangling back and forth, racing in contrary motion or blitzing with bursts of noise. On the new album, additional layers of guitar and effects bring more barbs. Ms. Tucker\u2019s lead vocals can sound like a banshee wielding a flamethrower. The women\u2019s voices also harmonize, overlap or converge from different directions; the drums kick from below and sometimes erupt. On the new album, as usual, the lyrics have plenty on their mind: love, desire, power, culture, politics, economics, the band itself. \u201cNo outline will ever hold us/It\u2019s not a new wave, it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d the women sing in \u201cA New Wave.\u201dAn accidental choice cemented Sleater-Kinney\u2019s sound. In her previous band, the guitar-and-drums duo Heavens to Betsy, Ms. Tucker had only tuned her guitar to itself. When she joined Ms. Brownstein in Sleater-Kinney, they ascertained that Ms. Tucker\u2019s guitar was tuned with its lowest string at C-sharp, not the standard E. They decided to both keep that tuning, which happens to push Ms. Tucker toward the topmost part of her voice.They are a disparate trio visually and temperamentally. Ms. Brownstein is dark and lean, while Ms. Tucker is fairer and more cherubic-looking than her vocals would suggest. Ms. Weiss doesn\u2019t hide a drummer\u2019s muscles. Ms. Brownstein describes her writing style, not incorrectly, as \u201cloquacious\u201d; Ms. Tucker is more succinct, the one who distills songs into titles like \u201cGimme Love,\u201d on the new album.Ms. Weiss spoke with fond objectivity of her bandmates over a lunch of organic Italian food. \u201cI definitely try to bridge a gap between them,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at their personalities \u2014 they play like that. Corin is so solid and steady, and she does have pretty good timing, and Carrie is all over the place, chomping at the bit. It\u2019s not one of them by themselves, it\u2019s the two of them together that\u2019s making the spark. And I have to somehow find out how to accentuate that spark and make it a fire, to ignite it.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on edge, and I think that\u2019s a good thing, really. I\u2019m not looking to have a hug.\u201dThe three women remained friends after Sleater-Kinney played its last tour in 2006, which was incendiary onstage and arduous backstage. Ms. Tucker was weary of the road and missing her young son, and Ms. Brownstein was suffering depression, anxiety and panic attacks. \u201cI felt like I was touring emergency rooms,\u201d she recalled. In \u201cHey Darling,\u201d a new song that speaks to fans about Sleater-Kinney\u2019s \u201cdisappearing act,\u201d one verse confesses, \u201cSometimes the shout of the room/Makes me feel so alone.\u201d The women moved on to other bands, other jobs and raising children. Reuniting Sleater-Kinney is \u201cnot a particularly sensible thing to do,\u201d Ms. Tucker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sensible job to have. But it\u2019s the job I\u2019ve loved the most in my life.\u201dMs. Tucker and her husband, the filmmaker Lance Bangs, had their second child, now 6, and she began leading the Corin Tucker Band, which has released two albums. Ms. Weiss recorded and toured with bands including Bright Eyes and Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, produced her own long-running band Quasi, and managed the locations department for \u201cPortlandia.\u201d She was also the drummer in Wild Flag, a band Ms. Brownstein formed with another indie-rock stalwart, Mary Timony; it released its lone album in 2011.The reunion started, Ms. Tucker recalled, with a conversation in late 2012 at her house, when Mr. Armisen and Ms. Brownstein were visiting. \u201cI think I said, \u2018Are we ever going to do that again?\u2019 And Carrie said, \u2018Well, I would love to do that again. But it\u2019s complicated because we have these busy lives now.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMonths passed as Ms. Weiss was re-enlisted and the women aligned their schedules. None of them took Sleater-Kinney lightly. \u201cAfter we stopped playing, I was more aware that we did not have clear predecessors or successors,\u201d Ms. Brownstein said. \u201cWhich is probably the thing I\u2019m most proud of. There was really no one like this band. It\u2019s like a language that was going extinct.\u201dTheir first new songwriting efforts felt familiar; fans might have been content with reminders of the past, but the band wasn\u2019t. They scrapped dozens of potential songs.As the album began to coalesce, Ms. Brownstein said, they wanted to be sure \u201cthat it had a life force to it, and had blood and guts in it, and wasn\u2019t enervated in any way, and didn\u2019t feel dragging, and didn\u2019t feel like a victory lap. I didn\u2019t want it to feel casual, I didn\u2019t want it to feel like a weekend expedition. The stakes had to feel high.\u201dSleater-Kinney also had its entire catalog remastered and rereleased by its current label, Sub Pop. \u201cStart Together,\u201d a limited-edition vinyl boxed set of all the band\u2019s albums, appeared in October, and it quietly included a white 7-inch single that read only \u201c1/20/15\u201d on its label. That was the first song Sleater-Kinney has released since 2005: \u201cBury Our Friends,\u201d which punches out guitar chords as Ms. Brownstein and Ms. Tucker sing, \u201cWe\u2019re wild and weary/But we won\u2019t give in/We\u2019re sick with worry/These nerveless days/We live on dread/In our own Gilded Age.\u201dIt\u2019s a representative song from \u201cNo Cities to Love,\u201d an album that\u2019s full of people buffeted by private demons and political forces, and fighting back. The galloping, clawing \u201cPrice Tag\u201d opens the album with a portrait of a minimum-wage mom facing America\u2019s postindustrial economy: \u201cWe love our bargains, we love the prices so low/With the good jobs gone it\u2019s gonna be rough!\u201d Other songs, like \u201cSurface Envy,\u201d could be about restarting the band or any other daunting, life-affirming struggle: \u201cI\u2019ll push twice as hard towards it you see/And the past falls away to the bottom of the deep,\u201d Ms. Tucker wails in full, shattering cry, defying all the scrabbling guitar and clobbering beats the band hurls at her.\u201cI just don\u2019t know anyone that can sing like that. And I know a lot of people that won\u2019t even want to sing like that,\u201d Ms. Brownstein said. \u201cThe deal-breaker element of art, that\u2019s really important to me. I like that there can be something that might be unpalatable for a lot of people. Because it makes fans that love it that much more fervent, that much more committed to it, committed to its strangeness, committed to its outsiderness.\u201dSleater-Kinney goes on tour in February, playing large clubs (including Terminal 5 in New York City on Feb. 26-27) in the United States and Europe, along with a handful of theaters. Ms. Brownstein then devotes the summer to shooting \u201cPortlandia,\u201d with more touring afterward. And then, Ms. Weiss said, the band will \u201cplay it by ear.\u201dWhat happens next could depend, paradoxically, on the band\u2019s discomfort level. \u201cDiscomfort has always served this band well, but it\u2019s thorny,\u201d Ms. Brownstein said. \u201cBut then when you hear the music, all the parts that were difficult serve the songs. It always sounds like you\u2019re fighting against something. But if we\u2019re doing it right, we\u2019re fighting together against the same thing.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the indie-rock band Sleater-Kinney, which has a new album out, misspelled the surname of the editor in chief of CMJ, which covers the music industry.

{"Headline": "Saving the Nuclear Deal With Iran", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut Mr. Rouhani is not the only leader trying to keep a potential agreement from being savaged by domestic opponents. President Obama has a similar problem in Congress, where Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, are expected to introduce legislation that could torpedo any deal by imposing new sanctions on Iran, including tighter controls on its battered oil industry. Negotiators for Iran and the major powers \u2014 the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany \u2014 resume their talks next week in Geneva. While they have made significant progress, they remain at odds over how large a nuclear program \u2014 geared for energy production and medical uses \u2014 Iran will be permitted to have.His skepticism is not unfounded. President Obama has the authority to temporarily ease sanctions on Iran, and he has done that to a limited extent by allowing Iran to receive about $700 million per month in assets frozen abroad under the terms of an interim nuclear agreement that has been in place since November 2013. Even so, the power to permanently lift most sanctions lies with Congress, where many members deeply mistrust Tehran, and Republican leaders have said that new and stronger sanctions are near the top of their to-do list in the new Congress. Such a move might be justified down the road if negotiations collapse, or if Iran cheats on its commitments. But at this stage it could easily undermine the talks, split the major powers and propel Iran to speed its nuclear development. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the new Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says he doesn\u2019t know where he will come down on any new sanctions legislation. But he is working to ensure that Congress gets a vote on any final nuclear agreement. His handling of the issue will be a major test of his leadership. His pledge to \u201cfigure out a way for Congress to weigh in\u201d so that it improves the chances for a \u201cgood outcome\u201d is not unreasonable. If the deal is good and Congress approves it, that should reassure Iran\u2019s supreme leader of America\u2019s commitment and improve the chances that the deal will \u201cstand the test of time,\u201d Mr. Corker told The New York Times. The question is whether such a vote could be exploited by opponents who would like to scuttle any deal. A deal that is verifiable and significantly limits Iran\u2019s nuclear activities can succeed if it both enhances regional security and benefits Iran. There will still be some risk for all sides. But the bigger risk is squandering this moment and leaving Iran free to pursue an unconstrained nuclear program. This would invite more sanctions, new tensions and perhaps even military action and a cyberattack. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burberry, McQueen and Others Puncture the Fashion Bubble", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe humble bag\u2019s runway appearance \u2014 wrapped around the heads of models like trash whipped in on the breeze \u2014 was the work of Christopher Shannon, 34, one of the liveliest designers showing in London. It might have been a missive from beyond the closed confines of fashion week, where roiling winds are blowing. Mr. Shannon offered up a sweater with a bag, too, to underscore the point. It read, \u201cThanks 4 Nothing.\u201dFrom a lesser designer, it might have come off as a bratty joke. But drollery is one of Mr. Shannon\u2019s strong suits. (He has a clever way of dissecting real clothes \u2014 the ones seen on the streets, rather than on the runways \u2014 and of twisting them into something rich and strange, like his track suits, split into strips like snap-studded fettuccine.) So those bags, and the anger they suggested, lent a darker resonance to the collection, one that resounded throughout many shows this week.\u201cI\u2019m not so aspirational in terms of luxury,\u201d Mr. Shannon said backstage at the Old Sorting Office, the former postal facility that is one of the official sites of London Collections: Men. \u201cI\u2019m not into croc rocking down the runway. It doesn\u2019t do much for me.\u201d Another sweater featured a Coke can whose tweaked logo read \u201cBroke.\u201dMr. Shannon isn\u2019t an outlier or a Cassandra preaching doom in the wilderness. He isn\u2019t even, as he may be considered in another city, or at another fashion week, a punk. (On the contrary, he\u2019s been knighted by the establishment, last year winning the inaugural British Fashion Council/GQ Designer Menswear Fund.) He\u2019s one of many designers here whose collections alluded to unease, unrest and uncertainty \u2014 albeit with a slight smirk.Outside the fashion bubble, after all, violence (or the threat of it) buzzes. The Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris two days before the official beginning of the London shows cast a pall over the week, even if it went largely unmentioned, save for a brief tribute to the victims and their families by Dylan Jones, the chairman of London Collections: Men. And the English and European economies in which these designers sell their indisputably luxurious goods are struggling.The responses to these outside factors vary. There are those designers who look for an escape hatch, like the father/son team Casely-Hayford, who called their collection of monkish layers and robelike alpaca-wool hoodies \u201cThe Runaways.\u201d (\u201cI guess we thought it was time,\u201d said Charlie Casely-Hayford, the son.)And there are those who batten down the hatches. \u201cWe\u2019re dressing for the apocalypse that\u2019s on its way,\u201d said Patrick Grant, the dapper designer of E. Tautz, whose collection of exaggerated, slouchy tailoring came in shades of pavement-puddle gray.29 PhotosHe was kidding, but only just.The men\u2019s season begins so early in the year that the just-passed Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays are an especially hot topic, and an industry that travels in pack formation, it turns out, vacations in packs, too.\u201cI went to Tulum,\u201d reported Ben Cobb, the handsomely bronzed editor of Another Man Magazine, Tulum being a thickly trafficked destination among fashion types at present. \u201cEveryone says \u2018hi.\u2019 \u201cBut in a climate like the present, it\u2019s hard to fault an escapist bent or those taking their pleasure where they may. The rapper Wiz Khalifa, for instance, one of the few celebrities making the front row rounds, was traveling in what appeared to be a choking cloud of pot fumes.Gloom didn\u2019t dim the shine of Jeremy Scott, who for the second season running brought his Moschino men\u2019s wear to London from Milan. He is an undaunted maximalist, who ran riot with faux fur, ski chic and bare chests (an odd trend throughout the week, in fact), inspired by Bruce Weber\u2019s photos of manly mountain men in his Abercrombie & Fitch mode.Christopher Bailey at Burberry \u2014 a very different designer from Mr. Scott \u2014 chose fantasy over grim reality, too. Burberry shows are always big-budget light-and-sound spectaculars; this time, with a performance by the British singer Clare Maguire, backed by classical instrumentalists. But by the time reflective confetti showered down for the finale, the scene resembled a Bollywood fantasia (an impression only abetted by the flashing trousers and totes, embroidered with tiny mirrors).Mr. Bailey called the collection \u201cClassically Bohemian,\u201d and his models wore poets\u2019 spectacles and fringed blankets and scarves knotted over their donkey jackets. But his rhapsody over the bohemian \u2014 what he defined backstage as \u201ca bit of freedom of the mind, something that is not necessarily conformist,\u201d between kisses with Liu Wen and Jourdan Dunn, supermodels who had dropped in, Burberry-clad, to see the show \u2014 felt flashy and a little forced, and the justification for throwing a fringed, grannyish blanket over a two-button suit (worn, naturally, sans shirt) hinted at that same old darkness lurking at the edges of the glitter. \u201cYou\u2019re not changing your whole self,\u201d he said, \u201cbut just trying to have some fun and try to see something light.\u201dIn the finest collections shown in London, the clothes didn\u2019t distract from darkness but telegraphed resilience in the face of it.Sarah Burton\u2019s collection for Alexander McQueen, for example, presented in a grim bunker among parked trucks, struck a martial note, with military-precise tailoring and clothes bearing capital-lettered legends of soldierly virtues such as HONOUR and VALOR.But Ms. Burton leavened the severity of her cuts (and the clone-like, stomping toughs who wore them) by piecing in motifs of poppies, the flower of remembrance for World War I. (In honor of the war\u2019s centenary last year, the Tower of London moat was filled with hundreds of thousands of ceramic poppies, an image still fresh in many minds here.) Ms. Burton\u2019s tailoring chops are well known and long established. But here, she managed to merge the strict and soulful, weaving war and peace into a single garment.The young designer Craig Green\u2019s show last season was such a breakout \u2014 met with wild enthusiasm and followed by tripled sales \u2014 that after it, he said, \u201cWe were terrified.\u201dBut the designer, 28, rose to the occasion, adapting his priestly, ethereal clothes into something more substantial, ready to bear the brunt of high expectations, and whatever else may come along. His tie-trailing jackets in cotton/nylon and neoprene looked more armorlike and protective than ever, inspired by military uniforms and workwear. But their strength was set off by the sweaters with an oddly evocative detail: a kind of porthole dead center, which revealed a pale and vulnerable wafer of the wearer\u2019s torso. (\u201cWe had to shave a few of them,\u201d Mr. Green laughed.)If Mr. Green is looking for a model of navigating success, there are worse ones to pick than Jonathan Anderson. Mr. Anderson has, despite (or because of) an insistence on abstruse conceptualizing, risen swiftly past the rank and file of many of his London contemporaries and into the big leagues. (In 2013, he was named the creative director of Loewe by its owner, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which also invested in his namesake label, J. W. Anderson.)But with every growth and success, rather than head for the middle ground, he has recommitted to experimentation and iconoclasm. His stridency can be alienating, especially when he throws concept bombs (his frilled culottes and lace babushkas for men come to mind), seemingly designed solely to provoke. But when he is at his best, as he was this season, he can be both provocative and inspired.The attenuated elegance of his collection, with its drippy sleeves and floppy, French-cuff trousers, objet d\u2019art buttons and smart, cropped jackets had a 1970s tang, but Mr. Anderson insisted he had looked not only at the \u201970s, but the \u201950s, \u201960s, \u201980s and \u201990s, too, a m\u00e9lange of references that he didn\u2019t try to resolve neatly.He preferred, as it he put it tellingly, to throw \u201ceverything that survives the apocalypse\u201d into the mix: \u201cthe best parts of all those things, and overhybriding it to the point where it becomes, \u2018Is it an \u201980s jacket or is it not? And does it really matter?\u2019 \u201dIs the apocalypse nigh? If so, Mr. Anderson is not one to spare himself or his audience. So he is cheerfully bounding into the uncertain future, on a runway of ground-up tires that stank to high heaven and looked like the surface of the moon. On the show\u2019s soundtrack, a voice intoned a list of all things torturous (including, for the record, an \u201cevil, gossiping fashion bastard\u201d).\u201cI feel like it\u2019s very uplifting to sometimes face it,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.And face it, it goes without saying, dressed to impress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paris Takes Pains to Reassure Tourists", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateA throng of visitors huddled outside L\u2019As du Fallafel on the Rue des Rosiers, braving the cold for a taste of the legendary restaurant\u2019s takeout shawarma and chickpea fritters. Around them, people jammed onto the narrow cobbled street, dressed in bright scarves, arms loaded with shopping bags and cameras.It was a typical Sunday in the old Jewish quarter of the chic Marais district of Paris, except for one detail: groups of French soldiers in camouflage and bulletproof vests, toting submachine guns with their fingers near the trigger.Less than a month after 17 people were killed at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket in one of the worst terror attacks on France, the government has been maintaining high security around Paris to reassure travelers that the City of Light is safe.Jewish sites, mosques, hotels, department stores, music halls, museums and historic monuments are all under heightened protection, and a security plan called Vigi\u00adpirate is in place at many sites, requiring visitors to undergo additional checks and bag inspections to enter. Surveillance has also been increased in the Paris Metro and in other high-traffic areas.\u201cFor visitors, Paris is safe, just as it was before,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Navarro, the managing director of the Paris Region tourist board. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any sign of panic or cancellations from visitors, although for the moment we have to wait and be cautious.\u201dMr. Navarro said the tourism board had received thousands of messages of support and solidarity. Representatives of his office planned to reassure tourism professionals and would-be visitors from other countries that Paris was open for business.Not everyone has been put at ease. January is typically a slow month for Paris, which hosted 47 million visitors last year. But reservations at four- and five-star luxury hotels slumped by up to 9 percent in the days following the attacks, according to MKG Hospitality, a travel study firm.\u201cParis tourism professionals have been wary for a long time about the possibility of a terrorist attack on the capital,\u201d Georges Panayotis, the president of MKG Group, said in a statement. \u201cGiven the emotional reaction, it\u2019s natural that some visitors would have deferred or canceled their stay.\u201dWith an additional 10,000 soldiers and 5,000 more police officers being fanned out across France, though, Mr. Panayotis said he expected any downturn to be temporary.Indeed, many travelers who had already made plans for Paris for the most part appeared to stick with them.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be afraid,\u201d said Joanne Negron, 51, who works for a power company in New York and had just arrived in Paris with her daughter, Siobahn Goodwin, 27, an accountant at Booking\u00ad.com. \u201cIf we lived in fear, we wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201dStopping under the stony facade of Notre Dame, where more armed guards patrolled the sidewalks, they noted that security was \u201call over the place,\u201d including at the Marriott hotel near the Op\u00e9ra where they were staying.Ben Takai, 32, an epidemiologist from Washington, D.C., said he had no qualms about visiting amid heightened security. \u201cSeeing soldiers with guns is not alarming \u2014 we saw that in the States after 9/11,\u201d he said, as guards patrolled outside Chez Marianne, a Jewish restaurant on the Rue des Rosiers.\u201cThings happen all over the world,\u201d Mr. Takai said, citing attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria. \u201cBut you can\u2019t allow that kind of fear to affect your decisions. The world doesn\u2019t stop turning.\u201dDiego Moreria, 33, a literature teacher from Brazil, had stopped at the Shoah Memorial near the Seine River, where five armed guards stood near the door. Part of his family is Jewish. \u201cViolence is everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re shocked in France because 17 people were killed. But in Brazil, you must leave the house every day with personal plans to stay safe.\u201dThe attacks had also not changed the minds of Muslim tourists from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, despite concerns within France\u2019s Muslim community of possible reprisals, said Bilal Domah, the director of CM Media, a London-based events management company. Paris still topped the list of desired destinations for halal tourism, which is worth billions of euros annually to the European economy, he said. \u201cFrance has open-minded people who understand that not all Muslims are the same,\u201d he said.Travelers have also been visiting the site of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, where makeshift shrines have been erected. A 10-minute walk from the Bastille, near the rue Nicolas Appert, the site of the newspaper\u2019s former offices, Hisashi Kikushina, 28, from Hiroshima, Japan, said he wanted to pay homage to the victims. \u201cI feel moved by what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI came because it\u2019s \u00adalso a way to stand up for free speech.\u201dMore travelers hovered over flowers strewn outside the Hyper Cacher market, the site of the second attack, this one in a Jewish community near the St.-Mand\u00e9 M\u00e9tro stop in eastern Paris.Mr. Navarro of the tourism board encouraged visitors to take in not just the city\u2019s classical monuments, but to venture to sites in ethnically mixed neighborhoods near the suburbs, which he said represented \u201ctwo faces of the same coin, which is Paris.\u201dOne highlight is the new Paris Philharmonic, a soaring steel music hall that was recently inaugurated at La Villette, a diverse quarter in the 19th Arrondissement.\u201cWe are here to welcome the world,\u201d Mr. Navarro said, \u201cwhatever their religion or nationality.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Feisty Finance Minister Tries a More Moderate Message", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 In the first days after the election victory of the leftist party Syriza in Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, the new finance minister, has lobbed some rhetorical grenades, referring to his country\u2019s foreign-imposed austerity budgets as \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d and calling Greece\u2019s international bailout deals \u201ca toxic mistake.\u201dNow, faced with the need to make good on promises to negotiate debt relief for his beleaguered nation, he seems eager to send a more moderate message.During an interview on Thursday morning in his office, Mr. Varoufakis, 53, poured a cup of coffee and took a large swallow. It had been a late night. On Wednesday, the day after he was sworn in, the Athens Stock Exchange had plunged on concerns that the Syriza-led government might wage a battle with Greece\u2019s international creditors, and he had stayed up to monitor the developments.In his view, the markets, as well as leaders in some national capitals, overreacted to the perceived threat from Syriza. The party swept to power Sunday on promises to reject the belt-tightening policies \u2014 a condition of 240 billion euros, or about $272 billion in international bailout loans \u2014 that have stifled the Greek economy.\u201cPeople have described this as a Wild West showdown,\u201d he said, sighing in frustration, \u201cbut it is not a \u2018yes or no, take it or leave it\u2019 situation.\u201dSettling onto a couch, Mr. Varoufakis \u2014 a self-described \u201caccidental economist\u201d and \u201cerratic Marxist\u201d \u2014 sketched out what he said was the heart of the problem: Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable and austerity constituted \u201cfiscal waterboarding, where we are constantly having our head held under water.\"He said Greece wanted to negotiate with its creditors. But he insisted that Greece was not seeking a confrontation with creditors, whether in Frankfurt, Brussels or on Wall Street.\u201cAll we\u2019re asking is for,\u201d he said, \u201cis an opportunity to put together a proposal that will minimize the costs of Greece\u2019s loan agreement and give this country a chance to breathe again after policies that created massive social depravity.\u201dWhether Mr. Varoufakis can strike the delicate diplomatic balance that his task will require remains to be seen.Time is short. Even if the new government does not want to abide by the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout agreements, the Treasury would seem in need of a remaining \u20ac7 billion loan disbursement from that program if Greece is to pay off foreign debts coming due by August.But, Mr. Varoufakis said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want the \u20ac7 billion.\u201d\u201cWe want to sit down and rethink the whole program,\u201d he added. \u201cOur task is not to get the next loan tranche,\u201d which he said would be merely \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201dInstead, the task \u201cis to restructure the debt and the economy to get the money we need.\u201dWhen pressed to describe how Greece would pay for bonds falling due in the coming months without taking the \u20ac7 billion installment, Mr. Varoufakis replied, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about details.\u201dTo Syriza\u2019s detractors, such remarks might signal that the new government does not understand the magnitude of Greece\u2019s financial challenges. But Mr. Varoufakis suggested that the government could finance its obligations by reducing the target for the so-called primary surplus, the amount of cash in Greece\u2019s coffers after expenses and interest payments.Creditors are demanding that Greece run a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product. Mr. Varoufakis, however, said Athens would propose to hold the level to 1 percent to 1.5 percent of G.D.P.Greece is also counting on creditors to provide some form of debt relief, which would also free up funds. Much of the rest of Greece\u2019s total debt of \u20ac318 billion is in the form of loans from other European Union governments, which do not want a write-down that would cost their taxpayers. Mr. Varoufakis wants to begin discussions with other finance ministers to talk about ways of reducing that burden and said the government would soon issue proposals.Tall and magnetic, with a square jaw and a buzz-cut head, Mr. Varoufakis tends to speak in thoughtful and theatrical tones that can prompt strong reactions. He does not wear neckties, something avoided by the rest of the Syriza leadership. On Thursday he was dressed in jeans, a black felt jacket with the collar upturned and a maroon T-shirt, along with motorcycle boots that he said were essential to wear on the powerful Yamaha that he rides everywhere.Born in Athens, Mr. Varoufakis studied mathematical economics and statistics at Essex, England, where he obtained his doctoral degree in economics. His academic appointments included teaching economic theory and policy, political economics and philosophy and econometrics at the University of East Anglia, Cambridge, Glasgow and Sydney. He also studied game theory, which he put to use as an economist at the Valve Corporation, an American video game company. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Athens.Mr. Varoufakis is married to Danae Stratou, a Greek artist with whom he collaborated on a photographic survey of borders around the world, including the wall between the United States and Mexico and that between India and Pakistan. From previous relationships, Mr. Varoufakis has a daughter and Ms. Stratou has two children.In a 2013 paper titled \u201cConfessions of an Erratic Marxist in the Midst of a Repugnant European Crisis,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis argued that Europe\u2019s economic malaise was not just another cyclical slump but largely a structural problem based on a European Union that was \u201ca fundamentally anti-democratic, irrational cartel that has put Europe\u2019s peoples on a path to misanthropy, conflict and permanent recession.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one in officialdom in Europe that\u2019s remotely like him in terms of intellectual reach and depth,\u201d Mr. Galbraith, an economist and professor at the University of Texas, said in a telephone interview.On Thursday, Mr. Varoufakis vowed that Greece would not have a financial \u201caccident\u201d or be forced to exit the euro currency union. Although Greece should probably never have entered the euro union, he said, he likened it to the Eagles\u2019 song \u201cHotel California,\u201d saying, \u201cYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\u201d\u201cThere will be no new haircut of private sector debt,\u201d he said.As for whether Greece could grow its way out of debt, Mr. Varoufakis said growth needed to be addressed first at a Pan-European level.He called for a \u201cNew Deal\" investment-led recovery program around Europe. But he dismissed a plan proposed by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to invest \u20ac300 billion to stimulate growth on the Continent without adding to debt, calling it \u201ca public relations gimmick that has unfortunately occupied the minds of good people for too long \u2014 it will be a failure.\u201dMr. Varoufakis played down concerns about the health and safety of Greek banks, despite reports that billions of euros in deposits have been fleeing the country.\u201cWe expected that the first few days of our government, things would be turbulent,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the markets see that the proposals coming from this government are sensible, cooperative and therapeutic, we anticipate that share prices are going to\u201d recover.He also said Greece was not halting privatizations, despite remarks on Wednesday from another minister suggesting that this was the case. \u201cWe want to ensure that this country becomes an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, but not interested in a fire sale or selling the family silver,\u201d he said.\u201cI understand the fear in our partners\u2019 minds that if Greece is given an opportunity to reboot, we may go back to our bad old ways and end up where we were in 2009,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that we reassure them that we won\u2019t do that, because we don\u2019t want to do it ourselves.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dangerous Moment\u2019 for Europe, as Fear and Resentment Grow", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a dangerous moment for European societies,\u201d said Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWith increasing radicalization among supporters of jihadist organizations and the white working class increasingly feeling disenfranchised and uncoupled from elites, things are coming to a head.\u201dOlivier Roy, a French scholar of Islam and radicalism, called the Paris assault \u2014 the most deadly terrorist attack on French soil since the Algerian war ended in the early 1960s \u2014 \u201ca quantitative and therefore qualitative turning point,\u201d noting the target and the number of victims. \u201cThis was a maximum-impact attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did this to shock the public, and in that sense they succeeded.\u201dA visual timeline of the attack and the events that followed.In Sweden, where there have been three recent attacks on mosques, the anti-immigrant, anti-Islamist Sweden Democrats Party has been getting about 15 percent support in recent public opinion polls.Paris was traumatized by the attack, with widespread fears of another. \u201cWe feel less and less safe,\u201d said Didier Cantat, 34, standing outside the police barriers at the scene. \u201cIf it happened today, it will happen again, maybe even worse.\u201dMr. Cantat spoke for many when he said the attacks could fuel greater anti-immigrant sentiment. \u201cWe are told Islam is for God, for peace,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you see this other Islam, with the jihadists, I don\u2019t see peace, I see hatred. So people can\u2019t tell which is the real Islam.\u201dOn Wednesday, Islamic radicals struck back. \u201cThis secular atheism is an act of war in this context,\u201d said Andrew Hussey, a Paris-based professor of postcolonial studies. Professor Hussey is the author of \u201cThe French Intifada,\u201d which describes the tangled relations between France and its Muslims, still marked by colonialism and the Algerian war.\u201cPolitically, the official left in France has been in denial of the conflict between France and the Arab world,\u201d Professor Hussey said. \u201cBut the French in general sense it.\u201dThe attack left some Muslims fearing a backlash. \u201cSome people when they think terrorism, think Muslims,\u201d said Arnaud N\u2019Goma, 26, as he took a cigarette break outside the bank where he works.Samir Elatrassi, 27, concurred, saying that \u201cIslamophobia is going to increase more and more.\u201d\u201cWhen some people see these kinds of terrorists, they conflate them with other Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the extreme right that\u2019s going to benefit from this.\u201dThe German interior minister, Thomas de Mazi\u00e8re, told reporters on Wednesday: \u201cThe situation is serious. There is reason for worry, and for precautions, but not for panic.\u201dWith each terrorist attack, however, the acceptability of anti-immigrant policies seems to reach deeper into the mainstream. In Britain, for example, which also has a large Muslim population, the U.K. Independence Party has called for a British exit from the European Union and sharp controls on immigration, emphasizing what it sees as dangers to British values and identity. The mainstream parties have competed in promising more controls on immigration, too.\u201cLarge parts of the European public are latently anti-Muslim, and increasing mobilization of these forces is now reaching into the center of society,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cIf we see more of these incidents, and I think we will, we will see a further polarization of these European societies in the years to come.\u201dThose who will suffer the most from such a backlash, he said, are the Muslim populations of Europe, \u201cthe ordinary normal Muslims who are trying to live their lives in Europe.\u201dNowhere in Europe are the tensions greater than in constitutionally secular France, with as many as six million Muslims, a painful colonial history in Algeria, Syria and North Africa, and a militarily bold foreign policy. That history has been aggravated by a period of governmental and economic weakness, when France seems incapable of serious structural, social and economic reform.The mood of failure and paralysis is widespread in France. The Charlie Hebdo attack came on the publication day of a contentious new novel, \u201cSubmission,\u201d by Michel Houellebecq, which describes the victory of Islam in France and the gradual collaboration of the society with its new rulers from within. Mr. Houellebecq, like the well-known caricaturists and editors who were killed at Charlie Hebdo, has been a symbol of French artistic liberty and license, and his publishers, Flammarion, were reported to be concerned that he and they could be another target.But the atmosphere has been heightened by the rise of the National Front and its leader, Marine Le Pen, who runs ahead of the Socialist Party in the polls, campaigning on the threat Islam poses to French values and nationhood.There was much recent attention to another best-selling book by a conservative social critic, \u00c9ric Zemmour, called \u201cThe French Suicide,\u201d attacking the left and the state for being powerless to defend France against Americanization, globalization, immigration and, of course, Islam. Another new novel, by another well-known French writer, Jean Rolin, called \u201cThe Events,\u201d envisions a broken France policed by a United Nations peacekeeping force after a civil war.\u201cThis attack is double honey for the National Front,\u201d said Camille Grand, director of the French Foundation for Strategic Research. \u201cLe Pen says everywhere that Islam is a massive threat, and that France should not support attacks in Iraq and instead defend the homeland and not create threats by going abroad, so they can naturally take advantage of it.\u201dThe military-style attack on Wednesday creates major security questions for France, said a senior French official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on such a delicate matter. \u201cWe knew this would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know how efficient it would be.\u201dMr. Grand noted that at least 2,000 young French citizens have traveled to fight with the militants in Iraq and Syria. \u201cSo how do we manage our Muslim population?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis kind of attack is very difficult to detect or prevent,\u201d he said, adding that the state must not overreact, which is what the radicals want.Still, he said, even given that the number of radical Muslims is a tiny minority in France, \u201cthere are definitely more than 50 crazy guys,\u201d so it will be important to know whether the attackers had been to Syria or \u201cwanted to go and did this instead.\u201d\u201cBetween this attack and whatever real societal problems we have in France, there is a great gap,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said. \u201cThese were not corner-shop guys from the suburbs.\u201dThe mood in Paris, near the scene of the attack, was both apprehensive and angry. Ilhem Bonik, 38, said that she had lived in Paris for 14 years and had never been so afraid. \u201cI am Arab, Tunisian, Muslim, and I support the families, the journalists and all the people involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is against Islam.\u201dWhen journalists are killed for expressing their views, it is one step away from burning books, said Annette Gerhard, 60. \u201cIt\u2019s like Kristallnacht,\u201d Ms. Gerhard said, noting that her family had died in Nazi deportations. \u201cThere\u2019s no respect for human life.\u201dRachel Donadio and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Profit Rises as It Puts a Stronger Focus on Its Industrial Business", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome crucial measures beyond top-line sales and profit also showed the progress, despite an uncertain global economy, weakness in some product lines and a stronger dollar. For example, so-called organic growth in its industrial business, which excludes the effect of acquisitions, grew by 9 percent to $32.2 billion. And the profit margins in G.E.\u2019s industrial operations, helped by cost-cutting initiatives, continue to improve, rising by half a percentage point to 18.8 percent.\u201cOver all, G.E. is doing the things it said it would,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.G.E.\u2019s results were helped by improving industrial demand in the United States, which is the company\u2019s largest single market, accounting for just under 45 percent of revenue.The American market for G.E. products, Mr. Immelt said, was \u201cthe best we\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis.\u201dIn the fourth quarter of 2014, G.E.\u2019s net income jumped 61 percent, to $5.2 billion. But the percentage increase was so large only because the year-earlier quarter included a charge of nearly $1.8 billion for payments related to a consumer finance business in Japan that G.E. had sold off.The company\u2019s operating earnings per share rose 6 percent to 56 cents. That result was slightly above the average estimate of analysts of 55 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.The company\u2019s quarterly revenue rose 4 percent to $42 billion, which was just below the Wall Street consensus of $42.1 billion. A stronger American currency, which reduces the dollar-denominated value of goods sold abroad, trimmed G.E.\u2019s reported revenue by $600 million in the quarter.Equipment orders typically trail oil-price movements by six to 12 months, so the impact was muted in the fourth quarter. Revenue from G.E.\u2019s oil and gas business declined 6 percent, to $5 billion, with operating profits rising 1 percent, to $814 million.But G.E. expects things to get worse for its oil and gas unit as the year proceeds, said Jeffrey S. Bornstein, the company\u2019s chief financial officer. But that division\u2019s management, he said, is moving swiftly to contain costs as demand deteriorates and that the problem should be \u201cmanageable.\u201dYet investors and analysts are skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s still a significant concern,\u201d said Mr. Winoker of Bernstein. The company\u2019s shares have fallen 4.6 percent in the last six months, though they were up 1.9 percent, to $24.75, in afternoon trading on Friday.G.E.\u2019s broad portfolio of industrial businesses should help to offset the falloff in orders for oil and gas equipment. G.E.\u2019s aviation business, which makes and services jet engines, and reported revenue of $24 billion last year, stands to gain from lower oil prices. When fuel prices drop, analysts say, airlines tend to use those savings to buy more aircraft \u2014 and consumers with more cash in their pockets travel more.G.E.\u2019s health care business is picking up in the United States, after being weak for a couple of years. Orders for the company\u2019s medical-imaging equipment increased 9 percent in the American market in the fourth quarter. Hospital administrators, it seems, have learned enough about the likely impact of the Affordable Care Act to formulate plans and move ahead with investments again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In State of the Union Address, Obama Is to Move Past Hardship and Reset Goals", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 With the American job market surging to life, President Obama plans to use his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to effectively declare victory over the economic hard times that dominated his first six years in office and advocate using the nation\u2019s healthier finances to tackle long-deferred issues like education and income inequality.In presenting a series of initiatives aimed at the middle class, Mr. Obama hopes to pivot finally from the politics of adversity and austerity that have frustrated him for much of his tenure. But coming off a midterm election defeat that handed full control of Congress to Republicans, the president faces long odds in actually enacting his agenda and in essence is trying to frame the debate for his remaining time in power and for the emerging 2016 contest to succeed him.For a president entering the seventh year of his presidency, the State of the Union can be a final chance to move past difficulties and set the agenda before the next campaign swings into high gear and consumes the nation\u2019s attention. Ronald Reagan used his to try to move past the Iran-contra scandal. Bill Clinton used his to try to move past his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern. And George W. Bush used his to try to move past a disastrous year in Iraq and a midterm election \u201cthumping.\u201d\u201cThe improving economy is the backdrop for the speech and context for the economic debate over the next two years,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser, said Monday. \u201cWe have proof that President Obama\u2019s strategy is working, and the Republicans now have a Chicken Little problem \u2014 all the doom and gloom they predicted did not come to pass.\u201dRepublicans cast Mr. Obama\u2019s slow-motion rollout of his State of the Union agenda in recent weeks as the desperate flailing of a lame-duck president who has not come to grips with the electorate\u2019s decision in November or the fact that the opposition now controls the Senate as well as the House. In defying reality, they said, he simply wants to return to the tax-and-spending ways of the past.\u201cI see this as the president returning to the theme of class warfare,\u201d said Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois. \u201cIt may have been effective in 2012, but I don\u2019t find it to be effective anymore. I think, frankly, he\u2019s out of ideas if he is unwilling to work with Republicans, and I think he is unwilling to work with Republicans.\u201dEither way, that may owe as much to a reviving economy as anything else. Unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent, gasoline prices are down, stock markets are up and the economy grew by 5 percent in the third quarter of last year, its fastest rate in more than a decade. For years, Mr. Obama has been cautious in welcoming positive economic news by noting that more work needed to be done to recover from the financial crash of 2008. But lately, he has been pushing the nation\u2019s economic prospects more robustly and without as many caveats, saying it is time to move to a new stage.He added: \u201cNow that we have fought our way through the crisis, how do we make sure that everybody in this country, how do we make sure that they\u2019re sharing in this growing economy? How do we make sure that they have the tools to succeed?\u201dOn Tuesday night, Mr. Obama will present the nation a series of proposals previewed in recent weeks that would make community college free for many students, expand paid family leave for new parents and raise taxes on the wealthy in order to cut them for middle-income families and pay for some of his initiatives.Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the politics of economic disparity are shifting, noting that Republicans like Mitt Romney and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida have been talking about the issue. \u201cAt some level, he\u2019s saying, \u2018O.K., welcome to the inequality debate,' \u201d Mr. Bernstein said of the president. \u201c \u2018What you got?\u2019 \u201dBut Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who has advised Republican leaders, said Mr. Obama may not be able to convince the country that he has made enough progress fixing the economy. \u201cIt will be an uphill battle, as his policy record on growth is not strong, the recovery is still unsatisfying and the inequality message is not popular, which is why he abandoned it so quickly after declaring it the issue of our time,\u201d he said.Stuart Stevens, an adviser to Mr. Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign, said Mr. Obama has no popular mandate for his latest initiatives. \u201cWe just had an election in which the president said his policies were on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to see what is different today than 60 days ago.\u201dIn laying out his agenda, Mr. Obama has pointedly made little effort to embrace that of the new Republican majorities in Congress. While they want to approve the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline, cut costly regulations and adjust the health care law to spare more businesses with part-time workers, Mr. Obama has vowed vetoes.The president\u2019s \u201cproposals are so out of touch you have to ask if there is any point to the speech,\u201d Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in a Twitter message.Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that the president\u2019s tax plan was \u201ca nonstarter\u201d that would not help businesses grow. \u201cMore government, a $300-plus billion tax bill from Barack Obama, is not the formula for this country to succeed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Generous Republican Benefits", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLAST week, President Obama signed a memorandum that would allow employees at federal agencies to take up to six weeks of paid parental leave, and he has made it clear that he thinks Congress should extend paid leave to employees in the private sector, too.No one expects the Republicans who control Congress to take him up on his invitation. Any attempts to thicken the social safety net through government spending are philosophically inimical to the G.O.P. point of view. Yet here\u2019s the irony: In their own offices, Republicans are often very generous with federal money, giving their staffs plenty of compensated time off to care for a child.Last week, I wrote to all 100 Senate offices and asked how they individually handled parental leave. While only 26 replied (not surprising, really; it meant voluntarily laying bare their private policies, always a touchy subject), it\u2019s worth noting that virtually all of the respondents \u2014 15 Democrats, two independents and nine Republicans \u2014 said they provided paid leave of some kind. What this means, practically speaking, is that all of them go above and beyond what the Family and Medical Leave Act requires \u2014 12 weeks of unpaid leave, assuming both employee and employer meet the requirements.The traditional liberal rap on the Republican Party is that its policies are hostile to working women. But that\u2019s clearly not how Republicans conduct themselves as bosses on Capitol Hill.Marco Rubio, the conservative presidential hopeful from Florida, gives his staff as much paid maternity and paternity leave (12 and six weeks, respectively) as Bernie Sanders, who started his career as an \u201cunabashed socialist\u201d in Vermont and went on to co-found the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Republican Mike Enzi, who successfully beat back a primary challenge from Liz Cheney in Wyoming last year, gives six weeks of paid maternity leave, which is identical to the policy of Dianne Feinstein, once the mayor of highly liberal San Francisco. (Barbara Boxer, also from California, offers 12, to both parents.)In offering eight paid weeks of parental leave for both sexes, the Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran goes further than the Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, who offers the same for mothers but for dads, three. The Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the HELP Committee (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) gives 12 paid weeks of maternity leave, which is just a tad more than the Delaware Democrat Chris Coons, who offers 10. (Most of these offices also say their employees can supplement their leave with unused sick and vacation days.)In other words, when confronted with the life challenges of their own personnel, these elected officials all believe paid compensation is in order.One might expect this from Democrats, who, as a matter of principle, believe that governments have an obligation to care for their citizenry when the free market fails to do so. But it\u2019s more surprising from Republicans, who generally speaking, do not. The question is, why?I put this question to Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, who offers six weeks of paid parental leave (and an extra two for the mother if there are complications during pregnancy). Her position is that there\u2019s a difference between the government\u2019s requesting that employers do something and requiring that they do it. In her office\u2019s case, she says that yes, she decided to set aside money for paid leave, but \u201cit means making cuts elsewhere \u2014 cutting the number of people we hire over all, or the travel my staff is able to do.\u201d When it comes to the private sector, she says, \u201cit\u2019s up to businesses to make that decision.\u201dAnd this belief is perfectly respectable as far as it goes. The problem is that we, as a nation, have been running this experiment for decades now, and the verdict is clear: Without government assistance \u2014 or nudging \u2014 most businesses will never feel the obligation to pay for family leave on their own. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 11 percent of private-sector workers got paid family leave in 2012. As Mr. Obama noted this summer, \u201cmany women can\u2019t even get a paid day off to give birth.\u201dMs. Fischer has attempted to provide a bipartisan solution to this problem by co-authoring a bill with Angus King, a Maine Independent who caucuses with Democrats, that would provide tax credits to businesses offering families paid leave. This notion is surely more palatable to the Republican-led Congress than Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative, which involves $2.2 billion in spending. But Ms. Fischer frankly concedes that she doesn\u2019t expect Congress to entertain their bill this session.Yet there\u2019s a solid case to be made that paid family leave is good for business. Three years ago, Rutgers\u2019 Center for Women and Work issued a report showing that women who took paid leave were far more likely to be working for the same employer a year later. It also added that women and men who returned to work after paid leave were far less likely to collect food stamps or public assistance in the year following their child\u2019s birth. As Ms. Fischer herself says, family leave also helps people on her staff \u201cdo their job well. They\u2019re not preoccupied, they\u2019re not worrying about everything that\u2019s happening at home when they\u2019re at work.\u201dIT\u2019S already a clich\u00e9 to point out that the United States is the sole industrialized nation without a paid maternity leave policy. (In case you\u2019re wondering what we have in common with Papua New Guinea, this is it.) According to a Pew study last April, our inability to provide affordable child care as a nation may help explain our declining rates in women\u2019s participation in the work force.Absent state funding and intervention on this matter, it falls to individual families \u2014 small, fragile, closed little loops of two parents (if that) \u2014 to resolve what the state and the private sector do not. It\u2019s utterly exhausting to them. It means a scarcity economy at home, with spouses quarreling about whose career is more important and whose time is more valuable. Someone almost inevitably needs to scale back ambitions or earning power in order to make life work.And that someone, usually, is the mom. Which brings me to this final plea: Even the most enlightened Senate offices \u2014 and private-sector offices \u2014 seem to believe that fathers require fewer weeks of leave than mothers. Mr. Obama himself referred to \u201cmaternity leave\u201d in his State of the Union address, not \u201cparental leave,\u201d as he had in previous statements. There are hundreds of arguments to make in favor of parity between the sexes when it comes to family leave. (High among them: More engaged dads allow their wives to lean in; more and more gay men are having kids, and shouldn\u2019t be subjected to different rules.) But here, I\u2019m going to name a very modest reason: It would make things more tranquil at home. Over and over again in my research, I hear mothers of newborns say, \u201cWhen my husband comes home from work, he wants to comfort the baby, but he can\u2019t, because the baby is used to me.\u201d And then the fights begin. Because Mom is tired. Mom wants a break.I doubt mothers would be hearing such things if fathers took equal time off from the get-go \u2014 paid or unpaid. Couples would be dividing child care and the domestic tasks more equitably (at present, mothers do nearly twice as much of both); they would also have two expert hands on deck. Their marriages would be stronger. And they\u2019d have the Republican Congress to thank.The author of \u201cAll Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Grass-Roots Pitch in Greece Could Pay Off", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Alexis Tsipras, the left-wing candidate who may well become prime minister of Greece next weekend, was taking questions from the public the other night on Twitter. Someone asked if he would eliminate the country\u2019s hefty value-added taxes on basic necessities.No, he said, he was \u201cnot going to promise things we can\u2019t do.\u201dBut the promises he has made are enough to suggest that Greece under his leadership would take a sharp turn from its direction of the past five years, when it has grudgingly adhered to European insistence on deep budget cutting in return for the financial assistance necessary to keep it afloat.Mr. Tsipras, boyishly handsome at 40, leads the Syriza Party, which polls suggest is likely to control the next government after elections next Sunday. He has emerged as a more polished figure than he was in 2012, when he first rose to prominence.Back then, he was usually described as a left-wing \u201cfirebrand\u201d who posed a potentially lethal challenge to the euro, the European Union and even the global economy, if he followed through on his threats to let Greece default on its debts or leave the eurozone \u2014 or both.Today, he sits atop a newly organized party that is still unabashedly left-wing but has softened its rhetoric and reached out to leaders across the world, even those with differing viewpoints. These days, Mr. Tsipras is more likely to talk of negotiation and the need to create a \u201cmodern European state\u201d free of corruption than to applaud default.But after years in which ordinary Greeks have felt little if any benefit from harsh austerity policies, and with the government still unable to perform basic tasks like tax collection, he is offering voters a populist vision in which they come first.He has pledged that on his first day in office, he will begin restoring electricity to poor households that have been cut off and provide food stamps to the growing number of destitute families. He and his lieutenants have also declared open season on the oligarchs who have dominated Greece economically and politically for decades.Mr. Tsipras makes clear that he expects Europe in general and Germany in particular to make concessions on Greece\u2019s crushing debt. In an interview in his starkly modern office at Syriza\u2019s modest headquarters recently, he waved aside the perception that he would threaten default, saying it was in everyone\u2019s best interest to negotiate a deal.\u201cLet\u2019s assume I owe you a million dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know you have two options: a) to give me the chance to have some income so I can pay you back, even 50 percent of it, or, b) let me lose everything, go bankrupt, and you get nothing back. What would you choose?\u201dAt a time when Italy and France, among other countries, are also questioning the German-led austerity orthodoxy, Mr. Tsipras could play a vital role in shaping the European debate. He is being watched carefully across Europe for signs of whether he really has moderated, or is just toning down his language to avoid scaring middle-of-the-road voters.His views \u2014 his promises to restore the minimum wage gradually and to undo reforms that made the labor market more flexible \u2014 along with his Communist past, have prompted some European officials to warn that a Tsipras victory could usher in a period of dangerous instability. German officials have announced that they have no intention of renegotiating Greece\u2019s huge debt and hinted that if Athens were forced to exit the European Union, it would be of little consequence.Such talk does not seem to trouble Mr. Tsipras, who believes it is all part of a negotiation process already underway. While such \u201cscaremongering\u201d might have worried voters two years ago, he said, with a quarter of the country unemployed and receiving no benefits whatsoever, it now \u201cjust makes Greeks angry.\u201dMr. Tsipras used to have a picture of Che Guevara in his office. But today, his renovated space has only one boldly colored painting on the wall: two bulls facing off. Mr. Tsipras said it captured the aggressive tension that exists in Europe.If true, it is a tension that sits easily with him. He has none of the strut that might fit his party\u2019s tough talk. He speaks quietly and laughs a lot. He has not worn a tie since his required time in the military and does not intend to change his ways.\u201cI think that if there is something that people appreciate in Syriza and me, it is that we haven\u2019t assumed this mentality of establishment parties, with specific ways to dress, to act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be ourselves, to believe in what we do.\u201dHe says he is worried not so much about winning the election as about piling up a big enough majority to rule without having to form a coalition. Polls have consistently shown Syriza in the lead, with most numbers ranging from 28 to 31 percent. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s New Democracy Party usually polls from 23 to 28 percent. But experts say that when undeclared voters weigh in, Syriza\u2019s lead is likely to rise even higher.A Tsipras win would put an end to more than three decades of domination by the same two political parties, whose officials often emerge in the morning from mansions in Athens\u2019 finest neighborhoods. Both of Greece\u2019s last two elected prime ministers were educated at Amherst College.Mr. Tsipras, however, studied engineering at Athens University and still rents his home in a mixed neighborhood of aging buildings and narrow streets. He has greatly improved his English in the last few years.He says that his party has ruled out any sort of partnership with the two traditional parties, Mr. Samaras\u2019s New Democracy Party and former Prime Minister George Papandreou\u2019s left-center party, Pasok.\u201cWe cannot cooperate with the powers that brought Greece to the edge of the cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to implement sweeping reform \u2014 in public administration, in how the state is run. We want to clash with this financial oligarchy that was ruling all these years in cooperation with the political establishment. We cannot do that if we form alliances with the political establishment that favored, and was favored by, the oligarchy. This is why we say that Syriza is a chance for Greece to become a normal, modern European country again.\u201dThis part of his agenda would fit in well with the views of Greece\u2019s international creditors.Critics fear that Mr. Tsipras and his advisers are sitting atop a still-young organization that pulled together supporters with divergent views, from Marxists to disgruntled members of Pasok, a mix that could prove hard to navigate.Some in the business community are also concerned that the party has talked more about the humanitarian crisis in Greece than what needs to be done to stimulate growth.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s gift for political leadership emerged early. He first made headlines when he was a teenager, already a member of the youth wing of the Communist Party and leading student rallies against education reforms. He met his partner, Peristera Baziana, also a member of the party, in high school. They have two children.Mr. Tsipras left the Communists and, after graduating, went into business as a civil engineer. In 2006, he ran for mayor of Athens, and after doing surprisingly well in the polls, he turned to politics full time.Friends of Mr. Tsipras said that his ability to stay calm was uncanny. In 2009, a clownish Greek comedian, who was making his mark ambushing and humiliating politicians, took aim at Mr. Tsipras. But Mr. Tsipras greeted him with open arms, bantered, laughed and even had the last word.\u201cHe is our nuclear weapon,\u201d said Nikos Pappas, his chief of staff.His political opponents are trying to paint him as a dangerous radical who would force Greece to leave the European Union. Mr. Tsipras has responded by ridiculing the critics, saying that he has now read that he would ban religious icons, block a proposal to build a football stadium and outlaw hunting. In one recent interview, he said he had been accused of doing everything except stealing other men\u2019s women.He said that after all they had read about him, European Union officials were always pleasantly surprised to find that he was a reasonable man who could discuss different ideas. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d he said of the critics, \u201cthey did me a favor.\u201d Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boehner Invites Another Response to State of Union, From Israel\u2019s Premier ", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The long-running debate over President Obama\u2019s foreign policy centered Wednesday on a speech to Congress \u2014 not the one the president just delivered, but one that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will give in three weeks.A day after the president\u2019s State of the Union address, Speaker John A. Boehner invited Mr. Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress next month for what would effectively be a rebuttal. In the perennial argument over whether Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to the world is wise or weak, Mr. Netanyahu essentially represents the \u201cweak\u201d case.The invitation stunned the White House, which called it a breach of protocol, but the surprise move was a sign that Republicans, who now control both houses of Congress, intend to use their new majorities to challenge the president not only on domestic policy but also on international affairs. Congressional leaders plan to press their assertion that Mr. Obama does not take the danger posed by Islamic terrorists, Iran or Russia seriously enough.\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m poking anyone in the eye,\u201d Mr. Boehner told reporters on Wednesday after announcing his invitation. \u201cThere is a serious threat in the world, and the president last night kind of papered over it. And the fact is that there needs to be a more serious conversation in America about how serious the threat is from radical Islamic jihadists and the threat posed by Iran.\u201dFew take those threats more seriously than Mr. Netanyahu, who presumably will tell Congress on Feb. 11 that Islamic extremism is on the rise in the Middle East and that Iran should not be trusted during negotiations over its nuclear program. Never close to Mr. Obama, Mr. Netanyahu appears to have decided it is time for a frontal appeal to lawmakers to counter the president.White House officials said they had learned of his appearance only Wednesday morning, shortly before it was announced. Not only is Mr. Obama not scheduled to meet with Mr. Netanyahu during his trip to Washington, but miffed aides to the president said they had not even heard directly from their Israeli counterparts that the prime minister would be in town.\u201cThe typical protocol would suggest that the leader of a country would contact the leader of another country when he\u2019s traveling there,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters traveling on Air Force One with the president to a speech in Boise, Idaho. \u201cThat certainly is how President Obama\u2019s trips are planned when we travel overseas. So this particular event seems to be a departure from that protocol.\u201dDecorum aside, the diplomatic row focused fresh attention on part of Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address that went largely overlooked amid attention to his tax and education proposals. While he outlined no new foreign policies, the president used the speech to defend his national security strategy, arguing that a more restrained approach had helped the country avoid messy overseas entanglements.\u201cThe question is not whether America leads in the world, but how,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the address. \u201cWhen we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts.\u201dWhile this is the year he had hoped to say he had ended two American wars with the withdrawal of combat forces from Afghanistan, the emergence of the terrorist group called the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has prompted him to send troops back to Iraq and to order warplanes to bomb enemy formations there and in Syria.But Mr. Obama noted that the total American military commitment overseas had shrunk sharply since he took office, with just 15,000 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, down from 180,000 six years ago. The situation in neither country, however, is as clean or settled as the president had hoped, and he now faces the prospect of finishing his presidency two years from now with at least one of them still unresolved.Mr. Obama said his strategy represented a \u201csmarter kind of American leadership\u201d that would eventually degrade and destroy the Islamic State. Working with allies, the United States \u201cis stopping ISIL\u2019s advance\u201d without \u201cgetting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East,\u201d he said.But he acknowledged that destroying the Islamic State would \u201ctake time,\u201d and he called on Congress to pass legislation formally authorizing the use of force \u201cto show the world that we are united in this mission.\u201dHis language drew complaints from Republicans that he was trying to minimize the severity of the challenge. While he vowed to \u201ccontinue to hunt down terrorists,\u201d he never used the words \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d and mentioned only in passing the recent attacks in Paris that galvanized world outrage.And his handling of Iran drew bipartisan criticism at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Wednesday. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman, objected to administration efforts to squelch legislation targeting Iran. \u201cSaying, \u2018No, we really don\u2019t want you to play a role, we want you to just trust us,\u2019 is totally unacceptable from my standpoint,\u201d he said.The committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who reportedly clashed with Mr. Obama over Iran during a private party retreat last week, was even harsher. \u201cThe more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran,\u201d he said.In his address Tuesday night, Mr. Obama repeated his vow to veto legislation threatening new sanctions against Iran if negotiations over its nuclear program did not succeed. Such legislation, Mr. Obama said, \u201cwill all but guarantee that diplomacy fails\u201d and perhaps force an armed conflict. \u201cThe American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom,\u201d he added.The president used the speech to mock those questioning his toughness and made Russia his case in point. A year ago, during the height of the crisis in Ukraine, Mr. Obama said some had suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin was demonstrating strength while America was on the defense.\u201cWell, today it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how America leads \u2014 not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\u201dWhat he did not mention was that Russia still controls Crimea, the peninsula it annexed from Ukraine, and still supports pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine despite a cease-fire. Russia\u2019s economy has indeed taken a huge hit, but so far, Mr. Putin has not backed down.Indeed, the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, decided to leave early from the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday to rush home after saying more Russian troops had crossed the border.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Romney,\u00a0in Speech at Mississippi State, Examines What Went Wrong in 2012", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Romney, speaking to students at Mississippi State University, discussed some of the shortcomings of his 2012 campaign and the lessons he learned from his loss to President Obama.He made clear that he would address head-on voters\u2019 uneasiness concerning his wealth, an issue Mr. Obama hammered him on. \u201cAs you\u2019ve no doubt heard, I\u2019m already rich,\u201d Mr. Romney joked.In a question-and-answer session after the speech, Mr. Romney initially said he would not explicitly discuss what went wrong in the last race. But then he spoke at length, couching a self-assessment in how the Republican Party should act in the next campaign.Mr. Romney, repeatedly criticized by his party during the presidential campaign for focusing on entrepreneurs rather than working-class Americans, said Republicans must better explain their stance on economic issues. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m talking about the economy and small business is because I want there to be more jobs,\u201d he said.Having lost in part because of his poor performance among minorities and his tack to the right during the primaries, Mr. Romney added that Republicans must make more direct personal appeals to nonwhite voters.\u201cWe tend to go to the audiences that vote in Republican primaries and tend therefore not to be as involved in minority communities as we need to be to win the general election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people to support us in the general election.\u201dMr. Romney seemed just as fixated on his political deficiencies when he stopped earlier in the day at a popular barbecue restaurant, the Little Dooey, to share a meal with Mississippi State\u2019s football coach, Dan Mullen.With reporters and television cameras just inches from their pork-filled table, Mr. Romney peppered Mr. Mullen with questions ostensibly about football: how he handles the news media glare, the agony of losing and the swift judgments based on success or lack thereof.Mr. Romney, who can be prone to gaffes, expressed a bit of envy that coaches rose or fell based almost entirely on their records.\u201cIt would be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience, what they\u2019ve accomplished in life, would be a bigger part of what people are focused on, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly, it\u2019s what you say \u2014 and what you do is a lot more important than just what you say.\u201d\u201cYou could be the sweetest-talking person in the world,\u201d he told Mr. Mullen, \u201cbut unless you got a record, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201dEven as he grumbled about the way politics is played, Mr. Romney broke what he said was \u201can unwritten rule\u201d of the business by eating with cameras present.Asked if this represented a \u201cnew Romney,\u201d Mr. Romney chewed on his pulled-pork sandwich topped with coleslaw before looking up. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat whether the cameras are here or not,\u201d he said.In his remarks at Mississippi State, Mr. Romney took aim at Mr. Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for a \u201ctimid\u201d foreign policy in the face of growing global threats.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the president understand that some of what we are seeing in the world is in part the result of his timid foreign policy, of walking away from his red line in Syria, of paring back our military budget and of insulting friends like Israel and Poland?\u201d Mr. Romney said.Mr. Romney offered a pointed criticism of Mrs. Clinton, who is preparing for a likely presidential campaign.\u201cSecretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cThe Middle East and much of North Africa is in chaos. China grows more assertive and builds a navy that will be larger than ours in five years. We shrink our nuclear capabilities as Russia upgrades theirs.\u201dHe also questioned a statement Mrs. Clinton made last year suggesting that businesses do not create jobs. \u201cHow can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn\u2019t know where the jobs come from in the first place?\u201d he asked.Mr. Romney has faced criticism from some powerful Republicans since expressing his renewed presidential interest, with some gently saying his time has passed and others speaking more harshly about his ambition, vanity and lack of a compelling argument for why he should run.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, each of whom would compete with Mr. Romney for the support of center-right donors and voters, have moved to create political operations and are actively courting potential supporters and financial backers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Accounting Problem", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGreece is back as a focal point of the world financial crisis. While coming elections are spooking the markets, the supposed cause of the crisis has not changed. Greece has a declared debt of 319 billion euros, or about $369 billion, 175 percent of its 182-billion-euro ($210 billion) gross domestic product. This sounds like a nearly impossible task for any government: to govern effectively, spur economic growth and avoid default. The shackles of the declared Greek debt have effectively paralyzed the country. Yet maybe all of this debt drama is unnecessary.The way this story is usually told, inside and outside Greece, is as a morality play: the profligate Greeks don\u2019t pay taxes and their banks and elites, in turn, rob Greek citizens and foreign investors alike. The Greeks, it seems, need to be held accountable and to pay back their debt at any cost.The brutal and counterproductive response has been austerity. But given Greece\u2019s problems, what the country really needs is transparency and accountability. Greece has a very weak tradition of accounting, with few homebred trained accountants. The government does not use International Public Sector Accounting Standards, or Ipsas, which measure liabilities and assets over time, similar standards to those used by leading governments, businesses, banks and investors at all levels. It\u2019s of little surprise that without internationally verifiable accounting standards, no one feels the need to be accountable.This lack of accountants not only means poor administration; it also means that the Greek government has done a lousy job of accounting for its debt number. In fact, the debt has been calculated to be larger than it actually is, or would be if one used Ipsas.Without real accounting, we also can\u2019t evaluate the claims of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s government \u2014 as well as those of numerous commentators \u2014 that Greece has made improvement in its fiscal position over the last two years. If the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank (known as the troika) are giving Greece 283 billion euros ($327 billion) of financing in return for good economic indicators \u2014 and credit ratings agencies like Moody\u2019s shake Greek and eurozone economies with pronouncements made on these numbers \u2014 one would think they would want to verify the numbers, using Ipsas, which would be much more transparent and something people outside the troika could realistically evaluate.But the Greeks are not the only ones content with bad accounting and fishy numbers. The troika itself does not use Ipsas in calculating Greek debt, but rather what is confusingly called the Maastricht definition of debt, which is based on face value.Think of face value as a promise to pay something in the so-far-distant future because its value is essentially worthless today if you don\u2019t get interest payments. This means that the troika calculates debt neither according to its financial worth, but rather according to a political agreement that ignores very low interest rates and the fact that money increases in value the longer you can hold and invest it. This is working to Greece\u2019s advantage, but Greece can\u2019t show it, and thus benefit from better credit ratings.Neither economic principles nor international accounting standards would regard this as an acceptable way to report a debt position. Greece was so cash-strapped and used to European Union handouts that its leaders signed off on the bailout deal without international accounting standards.The fact that Germany has acted as a vigilant gatekeeper over Greece\u2019s agreement to abide by the agreed debt and austerity measures should deserve scrutiny. Look again at the 57 billion euros ($66 billion) in German loans through the lens of accounting logic. The loans have been made at under 2 percent with maturities as far out as 2054.That means that, in reality, the interest on this loan is under market rates. Giving loans well under market rates with gaping repayment schedules amounts to a grant. According to Ipsas standards on German debts, this portion of the debt alone would require only about 13 billion euros ($15 billion), leaving Germany with a considerable 44-billion-euro ($51 billion) loss.But given the current draconian austerity conditions, Germany might be able to avoid showing the losses on the loan, yet it will destroy Greece in the process. Germany\u2019s demands for both austerity and overvaluing of the debt are both unjust and counterproductive for Greek and European stability.Greek debt is not what it seems. One reason might be that the Germans have refused to price the debt fairly, or properly report its value, which means in the short run that they extract more austerity from the Greeks than they should, and that they also keep this loan off the budget balance sheets because it would come up as a loss under any legitimate accounting standard.A little-known fact is that the Germans also do not use Ipsas and have notably opaque public finance standards. This means their potential loss on the Greek loan is out of sight of the German public, who, not great fans of the Greek bailout, would be even less enthusiastic if they understood the terms.It should also be noted that the Greek crisis has contributed to the 15 percent drop in value of the euro over the last year, and, with this low rate, German exports have been given a huge boost.By overstating Greek debt and effectively creating a false sense of crisis (the Greeks have been bailed out), the troika is undermining growth and investment through both the drama of overstated debt and by austerity measures that are ripping apart Greek society. If Greece continues with the yoke of this inaccurate debt number, it faces more recession and possibly political unrest, further destabilizing a hobbled Europe and the euro.Greek leaders should demand neither more austerity nor debt default. They should simply ask that the debt be calculated using Ipsas. And while they are at it, they should implement Ipsas at home to boost confidence, investment, credit and political stability. Clear accounting would show the Greek debt to be lower, stabilize the country, and bring confidence to Greece and, correspondingly, to the euro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Economy Shows Hints of Improvement, Survey Indicates", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkit\u2019s composite output index for the eurozone rose to its highest level in five months in January, at 52.2, up from 51.4 in December. A number above 50 signals that the economy is expanding, while a figure below that suggests contraction.Based on the most recent official European Union statistics, the eurozone economy grew only 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, for a 0.6 percent annual rate, far behind the 5 percent annual pace in the United States.But according to Markit, both the manufacturing and services sectors improved in January, though the firm cautioned that \u201cthe rates of increase remained weak by historical standards, most notably for new orders in the goods-producing sector.\u201dThe European economy has not yet recovered to its levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the financial crisis that followed. Consumer demand and business investment remain feeble, and governments in the bloc have so far largely resisted suggestions that they increase spending to restore momentum. The unemployment rate has not dipped below 11 percent since early 2012.Manufacturers, at least those that export goods outside the eurozone, may be benefiting from the sharp fall in the value of the euro, which has sunk to 11-year lows against the dollar. The euro, which fell 2 percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank announced its stimulus plan, continued to decline on Friday, falling another 1.4 percent to $1.1202 in afternoon trading.The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue-chip eurozone equities was up 1.9 percent after a 1.6 percent gain on Thursday.On Thursday, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, announced a program of so-called quantitative easing, under which the central bank will buy up to 60 billion euros, or $69 billion, a month of bonds. The plan, which has already been used with varying degrees of success by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, is meant to flood the financial system with liquidity and restore credit, lifting the economy.Bonds rallied on expectations that the central bank would soon enter the market. Their yields, which move in the opposite direction of the price, continued moving toward record lows. Interest rates on government 10-year bonds declined to just 0.37 percent in Germany, 1.34 percent in Spain and 1.49 percent in Italy.Highlighting a concern addressed by the central bank, Markit noted that lower energy costs were translating into falling input prices for businesses. As a consequence, the prices they charged \u201cfell at the fastest rate since February 2010 as lower costs were passed on to customers.\u201d Falling prices, if they continue, can be a drag on the economy.In Germany, the largest eurozone economy, activity accelerated modestly in January, Markit said. But in France, the second-largest, the picture was worse, with purchasing managers reporting that activity fell for the ninth straight month.Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement that while the slight improvement from late 2014 was welcome, \u201cthe rate of expansion remains worryingly weak,\u201d indicating growth in gross domestic product of 0.2 percent at a quarterly pace.The eurozone economy remains \u201cboth fragile and susceptible to shocks and further setbacks,\u201d Mr. Williamson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Young Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 When Jordan Casey took to the stage to present his technology business, he jumped onto the platform rather than walking up the access ramp.Entrepreneurial energy? Yes, but also adolescent enthusiasm.\u201cI feel I\u2019ve got a head start,\u201d Mr. Casey told the audience here, a group of 200 or so teenage achievers, some of them intent on breaking through what many consider European obstacles to business. \u201cIn 10 years, I will be 25 and I will already have 13 years of experience working in the industry, so that is kind of cool.\u201dPotential hurdles to the young and business-minded that were discussed during the three-day conference were a rigid education system in many of the European Union\u2019s 28 countries; a cultural aversion to risk-taking in some parts of the region; and a stagnant economy in which youth unemployment is a pressing social problem. The role of speakers like Mr. Casey was to provide can-do pep talks.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m still Europe\u2019s youngest chief executive, but I certainly feel I\u2019ve got a head start,\u201d Mr. Casey said later in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t be doing as much work as I like to, because I sort of have to go to school as well, play football and be a kid.\u201dMr. Casey, from Waterford, Ireland, is a software developer.He started computer programming when he was 9. He then developed a game called Alien Ball vs. Humans that topped the charts in the Apple Store in Ireland. In 2012, he registered his first company, Casey Games, with a staff of two \u201cwho also didn\u2019t find it easy to work because of all the school exams,\u201d he said. Since then, he has launched two business apps, one for teachers and another for event organizers, while continuing to attend high school in Waterford.Notably, one prospect the precocious entrepreneur does not find enticing is attending college.\u201cI really don\u2019t see what university could teach me that I can\u2019t learn for free immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of skills that you can learn yourself and just by using the Internet.\u201dIn the United States, the lore of the tech industry has its many teen touchstones \u2014 whether Steve Jobs founding Apple in his parents\u2019 garage at 19, or the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg starting his first software-based company while still in high school.But in Europe, young people with the brains and DNA to build businesses from an early age do not often see or seize the opportunities the way Jordan Casey has \u2014 or the way Nick D\u2019Aloisio did.One of the young Spanish entrepreneurs addressing the conference, Luis Iv\u00e1n Cuende, 19, argued that Spain\u2019s oppressively high youth unemployment \u2014 52 percent at the end of 2014 \u2014 is \u201cbecause of the enormous gap between our rigid and theoretical education system and the labor market, which means you come out of many years at school without a clue about the outside world.\u201dMr. Cuende, who started programing on his own when he was 12, complained in an interview that Spain\u2019s education system was run by \u201cpeople stuck in the past.\u201d He recalled that the technology course he took in high school in Oviedo, was given by \u201ca teacher who knew nothing about computing and was about to retire.\u201dMr. Cuende plans to roll out next month Stampery, an online copyright certification system that will use technology similar to that of the Bitcoin payment system. \u201cWhat I most enjoy is just to develop a product,\u201d Mr. Cuende said.But he acknowledged a missed opportunity. He still keeps on his phone a one-line text message \u2014 \u201cyou should come work with us\u201d \u2014 that he received in November 2013 from Jan Koum, the Ukrainian-born American who was a co-founder of WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application.The company was acquired by Facebook a few months later. \u201cI turned down his offer, but since his company then got sold for $19 billion and every employee held some options, it\u2019s a bit painful to think about that decision,\u201d Mr. Cuende said.Endesa, a Spanish utility, was among the sponsors of the Madrid conference. Federico Fea, the company\u2019s chief innovation officer, said he wanted to start recruiting to his team employees \u201cjust based on talent,\u201d independent of age or whether they have a college education.Endesa employs 10,500 people in Spain, a majority of whom are from 45 to 54 years old. Given the high unemployment in Spain and the region generally \u2014 nearly 10 percent for the European Union over all \u2014 \u201cEurope needs to become more flexible in its approach to the labor market,\u201d Mr. Fea said.Mr. Fea said that in terms of promoting entrepreneurship, though, Europe\u2019s biggest hurdle was not structural but instead \u201cour incredible fear of failure,\u201d particularly in southern countries like Spain and Italy. In the United States, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re nobody until you have failed once or twice.\u201dThe European Union is not a monolith, of course. So entrepreneurial attitudes and opportunities vary.Eiso Kant, a 24-year-old Dutch entrepreneur \u2014 a veteran, by the conference\u2019s standards \u2014 has settled in Madrid.

A spending plan of $6.1 billion for 2015, passed by the Legislature last year, will fall $3.5 billion short, or more, if oil prices keep falling. Alaska collects no state sales or income taxes to pick up the slack; a savings fund from past oil earnings will help, but it cannot fully fill the gap either.\u201cEven if you lay off every state employee, that only saves us a billion,\u201d said Representative Chris Tuck, a Democrat and the minority leader in the Alaska House of Representatives, putting the problem in context. \u201cWe\u2019d still have $2.5 billion to go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about deep cuts, and they will hurt,\u201d Mr. Walker said in a prime-time address last week.Republicans who control both chambers of the Legislature \u2014 many of whom were Parnell allies \u2014 are already signaling that they may not embrace Mr. Walker\u2019s ideas for solving the crisis. A 63-year-old businessman, lawyer and former Republican, Mr. Walker had a Democrat as his running mate, and last held elected office in the 1970s, as mayor of the small town of Valdez.\u201cWe might agree to disagree,\u201d said Mike Chenault, the Republican Speaker of the House. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to keep an open mind and keep all avenues of conversation open, and I\u2019ll continue to do that until we either decide that we can make this work or we can\u2019t.\u201dDemocrats, long accustomed to being on the outside looking in at power in this right-leaning state, have almost nothing but praise for the new governor and his proposals.\u201cHe\u2019s in a beautiful position in some respects, because he doesn\u2019t owe the traditional political establishment anything,\u201d said Senator Berta Gardner, a Democrat and the Senate minority leader. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician, and that\u2019s going to create some hurdles for him, but he has made some very good choices.\u201d The new governor, for his part, has said that Alaska\u2019s distinctive political culture, economy and history \u2014 its days as a territory before statehood in 1959 still fresh and resonant, its relatively small population accustomed to politics with a homespun accessibility \u2014 will make for a unique, if tough, solution.In one respect, Alaska is also extremely lucky: lawmakers set aside about $14 billion in savings during the fat years, which Mr. Walker has called \u201ca bridge,\u201d which must be trod gingerly. Tapping too little of it, he said, would force even more drastic spending cuts; spending too much could deplete the fund before the crisis has past.\u201cBefore we had money, we had guts,\u201d he said in a recent speech, quoting Walter J. Hickel, the former Alaska governor and United States interior secretary, whom Mr. Walker has called a personal hero and mentor.But an alternative model for the new Walker administration has also emerged \u2014 a surprising one, perhaps \u2014 in Sarah Palin. Mr. Walker and his allies say the current moment harks back to her election as governor in 2006: She was outside her party establishment, though nominally a Republican, and worked with a coalition of Democrats and Republicans after a spate of scandals involving the oil industry. (Ms. Palin endorsed Mr. Walker last fall, though they have not communicated since the election.)\u201cShe took on an incumbent governor, as I did,\u201d Mr. Walker said in an interview. \u201cShe did it within the party, I did it outside the party \u2014 so there could be some comparisons.\u201dOil production, meanwhile, has slid \u2014 to barely a fourth of what it was at its peak in the late 1980s \u2014 as old wells drilled a generation ago produce less. Declining oil sales have compounded the impact of the price declines.The governor\u2019s secret weapon, though, his allies said, might be public support \u2014 if he can sustain it and use it as a lobbying force.\u201cThat\u2019s my challenge and my opportunity \u2014 to reach out to those folks and let them know we have an open door,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to turn our cards face up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Lost Time", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Russia, where religious holidays have not supplanted secular ones, New Year\u2019s Eve is much more important than Christmas. The fact that the country\u2019s biggest holiday marks the turn of the calendar illustrates the special relationship Russians \u2014 and particularly their rulers \u2014 have with time. Historically, many Russian leaders have fallen into two broad categories: those who tried to freeze time (Czar Nicholas I and Leonid Brezhnev, for example), and those who wanted to speed it up (Peter the Great, Alexander II, Nikita Khrushchev). The former group worshiped tradition, the latter emphasized change. In any case, attempts to turn back the clock have always alternated with outbursts of frenetic activity.\u201cThe choice is either death or catching up with and overtaking the advanced capitalist countries,\u201d Lenin warned his cohorts. And Stalin, in defending his forced industrialization program, declared: \u201cWe are 50 or a 100 years behind the advanced countries. We must run that same distance in 10 years. Either we do it or they crush us.\u201d Vladimir V. Putin defies both these categories, yet when it comes to keeping power, his sense of timing is masterful. Take the case of the popular opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, who was scheduled to be sentenced on politically motivated embezzlement charges on Jan. 15. Suddenly, as the threat of protests loomed, the government rescheduled the sentencing to this past Tuesday. And instead of the 10-year prison term prosecutors had requested, Navalny received a suspended sentence. But his brother and co-defendant, Oleg, was sentenced to three and a half years in jail, a ruling that many saw as a way to punish Alexei obliquely. There was nothing really unusual about this. Many Russian rulers have aspired to be masters of time \u2014 including the time they spend at the seat of power. No Russian reign has ever had predefined limits. Most pre-revolutionary rulers died on the throne, or were overthrown and murdered. As hereditary monarchs, the czars\u2019 days in power were limited only by accident, disease or their relatives\u2019 eagerness to take their place. Nicholas II abdicated in 1917 but was later shot by the Bolshevik political police.Soviet leaders, except for Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev, also held their posts for life. Khrushchev, overthrown by the party leadership in 1964, was the first to live to write his memoirs and die of natural causes. Gorbachev not so much vacated the seat of power as saw it slip from under him as the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991. Boris Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s first post-Soviet president, resigned at the end of 1999, thus becoming the first Russian leader to relinquish the post voluntarily.Dmitri A. Medvedev, the current prime minister, served one full presidential term between 2008 and 2012. Though there was a chance, however slim, for him to seek a second term, cynics (or, if you prefer, realists) knew that he was merely a placeholder for Mr. Putin. In a perfectly timed switch, the two men traded places in 2012.Unfortunately for their countrymen, the move will keep Russia behind the times and out of step with its immediate neighbors. In a recent Foreign Affairs article, \u201cNormal Countries: The East 25 Years After Communism,\u201d the social scientists Andrei Shleifer and Daniel Treisman divide post-Soviet bloc nations into \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d reformers. They find that the faster and more thorough the reforms, the less economic pain. \u201cThe gradual reformers eventually caught up to the radical reformers,\u201d they write, \u201cbut not before suffering many years of costly underperformance.\u201dAnother interesting finding is that post-Communist nations, while trying to catch up with the West, tend to emulate their neighbors. The Baltic states have learned from Finland; those of Central Europe from Austria and Germany; the countries of the Caucasus from Iran and Turkey. The economies of those countries once out of step with one other are now synchronizing. One reason Moscow seems out of sync with most of its neighbors is that Russia could never expect to become a part of the European Union, a prospect that provided a powerful incentive for change in nations like the Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland. These countries were escaping Russia and joining Europe. Russia could not escape itself. But there is an even more important difference, something the Romanian-born philosopher Emil Cioran called Russia\u2019s \u201chistorical belatedness.\u201d For decades Russia could sustain long periods of inaction on pressing issues, mostly out of fear. The czars postponed the abolition of serfdom for decades because they feared that the move would upset the delicate status quo between nobility and peasantry. Reform, when it finally came, was executed gradually and didn\u2019t succeed in producing enough independent and economically stable property owners who would be immune to revolutionary calls for land redistribution. Czarist attempts to maintain the status quo led to the country\u2019s explosion. A similarly pressing issue today is reform of the Russian judicial and law-enforcement systems \u2014 something the Kremlin has indefinitely postponed. A dependent judiciary and police force inherited from the Soviets and never meant to protect civil and property rights is a reliable tool to keep political control. But the absence of a rule-based environment has prevented Russia from developing enough independent and economically viable property owners with a stake in maintaining the status quo. In an isolated, economically reeling nation, people who don\u2019t have a stake in the system will turn against it. Once again, attempts to maintain the status quo may lead to an explosion. Political time in Russia seems to drag on for ages. Our New Year celebrations will not be a mark of coming change. They will simply remind us of the reality that Russia is, once more, dangerously behind the times. As with many previous regimes, our current leaders have died a moral death long before their days in power end. When they leave, the next generation of Russian leaders will once again have to play catch-up. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sri Lanka to Free Tamils and Return Their Land", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 The Sri Lankan government pledged Thursday to free hundreds of minority Tamil detainees and return much of the Tamil land in the north and east that the military seized and continues to hold years after the end of the country\u2019s bitter civil war.The promises represent the most significant efforts yet announced by the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena to heal the still-festering wounds of a decades-long civil war that ended in 2009. Thousands of civilians were killed in the final weeks of the war, waged by separatist Tamil rebels who had long felt marginalized by the dominant ethnic Sinhalese group. Hundreds of civilians surrendered to government forces, only to disappear while in government custody. The question of whether those who disappeared were killed by government forces or are still alive in a camp somewhere has long tortured families in the formerly restive provinces.Rajitha Senaratne, the minister of health and a spokesman for the new government, said this week that 275 people detained on suspicion of rebel involvement were still held in camps and jails, but he added that no one seemed to know how many face charges or have languished without formal proceedings against them.The promise to return seized lands will also give hope to thousands who have been living in refugee camps for decades. In many cases, the government seized the lands not for security purposes but simply because the holdings were attractive for development, often providing no compensation in return. Thousands filed suit in cases that have long languished in the courts.Much of the land was used by the military to develop tourist hotels, golf resorts, and poultry and vegetable farms in former conflict zones in the northern and eastern parts of the country, making the military a significant force in the country\u2019s civilian economy.Former landowners were mostly barred from visiting the seized areas, and their homes were often bulldozed or left to rot.\u201cWhatever was acquired for business purposes, other than security purposes, we want to give back to the owners,\u201d said Dr. Senaratne.Dr. Senaratne said the new policy was a profound change in the government\u2019s philosophy about how to prevent a resurgence of separatist sentiment among the Tamils.Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the government was waiting for a list of legal titleholders to begin releasing the land to its rightful owners. \u201cThe process should start very soon,\u201d he said in an interview.The new government has taken several steps toward reconciliation with the Tamil minority since assuming office three weeks ago. The new governor, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, a retired diplomat, will assume his new duties on Monday in Jaffna, the northern provincial capital.Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Gardiner Harris from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A. With Charles Plosser of the Fed: Raise Rates Sooner Rather Than Later", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe Fed changes the membership of its policy-making committee each year, and in the latest rotation, some of the most frequent dissidents lost their voting seats.Those officials, however, remain concerned about the course of policy. In an interview before the most recent meeting, Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, described his reasons for fearing that the Fed was retreating too slowly from its stimulus campaign.You want the Fed to move more quickly toward raising short-term interest rates even as inflation decelerates. Why aren\u2019t you worried that inflation is below your 2 percent target?We\u2019ve all been kind of expecting this given what oil prices are doing. A few years ago when oil prices shot up, we looked through that, and it\u2019s important that we do that now. It\u2019s not been surprising to me that the headline numbers have been soft. The bigger question is what happens in four to six months. Will inflation begin to drift back up toward our target? I think it will. I\u2019m kind of comfortable with that for now. The oil decline does seem to have at least stabilized.Does your confidence basically rest on the stability of inflation expectations?Why do you think survey-based measures of expectations, which have held steady, are more accurate than market-based measures, which have declined recently?Forecasters have been better judges than the market measures. It\u2019s one of those areas where there\u2019s theory and empirical work, and the empirical evidence seems to be that inflation is kind of sticky. The underlying inflation seems pretty slow-moving and persistent. Forecasters generally understand that, even if we don\u2019t fully understand why, and so forecasts that rely on that persistence seem to do well. The bigger challenge is trying to understand why that\u2019s the case. That\u2019s a story and it\u2019s kind of the best thing we\u2019ve got going for us.You also don\u2019t see low inflation as an indication that the economy is still weak.I think that view clearly and historically was challenged rather significantly in the '70s and it failed, and I think that view failed in the early part of this recession when the economy fell out of bed by anybody\u2019s definition and inflation didn\u2019t move that much.It\u2019s a question in part I believe about uncertainty and measurement error. I think working with slack is a really challenging thing that we measure with error \u2014 we don\u2019t even have good theories of what we ought to be looking at in the first place \u2014 and so I oftentimes have said, \u201cLook, as a policy maker when you want to make policy, the general principle is that you try not to place too much weight on something you measure with a lot of error.\u201dYour dissents over the last year basically took issue both with the Fed\u2019s communications strategy and with the content of the message. What is wrong with the message?We have had a better economy than we thought it was going to be; we\u2019re way ahead of where we thought we were going to be. As a committee we say we\u2019re data dependent. And if we\u2019re going to be data dependent, we need to explain why we\u2019re ignoring the data, why we\u2019re not reacting to the data. Our forecasts are changing. Why aren\u2019t we changing the message?By standing still do you think that the Fed effectively has loosened policy?By keeping the balance sheet flat and leaving the forward guidance in place, yeah.Given the low level of inflation, what\u2019s so dangerous about pressing for faster growth?It may work out just fine, but there\u2019s a risk to that strategy, and the risk is that we wait until the point where markets force us to raise rates and then we have to react quickly and aggressively. I believe that if we wait too long, then we run the risk of falling very far behind the curve or disrupting the economy by rapid rate increases. I would prefer us not to be in that bind because then we really will be between a rock and a hard place. There\u2019s no way at the end of the day that we can change policy without having some volatility. But I would prefer us trying to be a little more \u2014 I guess Greenspan would have called it pre-emptive \u2014 but monetary policy works with pretty long lags sometimes and so I think we have to be prepared. I\u2019d prefer us acting a little earlier and being able to go gradually than having to wait a long time and having to go rapidly.Trying to avoid the kind of thing that just happened in Switzerland?I have a lot of sympathy for Switzerland. It\u2019s a small country that depends heavily on the eurozone for its exports. They\u2019re at risk because of that. Nothing they can do about it. And the danger is any time you try to use monetary policy to either thwart or offset or fix something that you\u2019d like to change in the real economy, you typically fail. Market forces overwhelm you.In Switzerland\u2019s case they tried to peg their currency as a way to keep it from rising and support the real economy. But Europe is weak. The E.C.B. can\u2019t solve the structural problems that Europe has, and if Europe is going to remain weak, Switzerland also has a problem. And they can\u2019t cover it up with monetary policy. They can\u2019t afford to do it anymore. They can\u2019t solve the fundamental problem of the trade relationship between a small open country in the middle of Europe and the rest of the continent.The history is that monetary policy is not ultimately a very effective tool at solving real economic structural problems. It can try for a while but the problem then is that it\u2019s only temporarily effective, and when you can\u2019t do it anymore you get the explosion yesterday in the Swiss market.One of the things I\u2019ve tried to argue is look, if we believe that monetary policy is doing what we say it\u2019s doing and depressing real interest rates and goosing the economy and we\u2019re in some sense distorting what might be the normal market outcomes at some point, we\u2019re going to have to stop doing it. At some point the pressure is going to be too great. The market forces are going to overwhelm us. We\u2019re not going to be able to hold the line anymore. And then you get that rapid snapback in premiums as the market realizes that central banks can\u2019t do this forever. And that\u2019s going to cause volatility and disruption.O.K., now for the way that the Fed communicates. How should the Fed describe its plans?I would like us to focus more on describing how monetary policy reacts to data. We need to talk about, \u201cThis happens and we\u2019re going to do this, that happens and we\u2019re going to do that.\" And in doing so you begin to communicate more to the public about, \u201cHow does the F.O.M.C. think?\" And you try to provide some consistency and then the public and the markets learn from that how we\u2019re likely to act in the future. To me that\u2019s better than forward guidance. Why do we want to make commitments about the future when we don\u2019t know what it holds?Date-based guidance sometimes seems like a way for the Fed to achieve a consensus without actually achieving agreement. That\u2019s actually part of a challenge for the goal of consensus policy-making. To build a consensus you make vague statements that everybody can interpret any way they want to. Is that good communication? No, because everyone on the committee gets to interpret it their own way and then people get confused as to what it really means.In retrospect, in reflecting upon the way that policy gets made, I think the desire to create big tents in the language actually becomes somewhat counterproductive to effective communication. I don\u2019t have an easy answer. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s worth thinking about.You go to the Bank of England, you see votes there 5-4, 6-3, all the time, and it\u2019s not a big deal. People disagree but by disagreeing it allows the statement to more accurately reflect the views of the people that voted for it, and so the people that didn\u2019t vote for it can be more articulate about why they disagree, so the differences and the range of views becomes more clear.A lot of people speculated when the Bank of England started doing this that it was going to cause disruptions. It didn\u2019t. It allowed people to better assess what the future might look like because the differences weren\u2019t papered over.Basically prioritize precision over consensus.Yeah.Some of your colleagues don\u2019t see dissent as a useful gesture. Do you think your dissents have been effective?I don\u2019t know how effective it has been. I\u2019m trying to accomplish a couple of things. I think it\u2019s very important in the Fed and in other organizations that we openly discuss and debate different points of view. I think this has been extraordinarily important, even more so in challenging times than in normal times. We\u2019ve entered a period where we\u2019re kind of in uncharted territory. We don\u2019t fully understand what happened or what made it happen. Economists are still debating the Great Depression. We\u2019re going to be debating this for a long time, too. So this is a period of uncertainty and so you have good people sitting in that room, smart people, trying to figure it out. And it shouldn\u2019t be surprising at all that all of these smart people have different ways of thinking about this. This is not a conventional episode.I also think it\u2019s an important thing to convey to the public that all of these different views are being debated within the Fed. It ought to be \u2014 I know the markets don\u2019t like it \u2014 but ought to be reassuring in terms of public confidence that there\u2019s a healthy debate going on. Always striving for unanimity creates a false sense of certainty that we know more than we actually do.I also think if I\u2019m going to go out in speeches and communicate ideas and differences of opinion and then not vote, that\u2019s not very credible. That\u2019s saying one thing and doing another. Why would you have a different view in public but not live up to that view inside the meeting when you take a vote? I think I have to match those two things.Would the economy be better off if the Fed had stopped buying bonds in 2010?I do think of QE1 and the subsequent QEs as very different. QE1 was a true liquidity event as far as I\u2019m concerned. It was a financial crisis. I have some disagreements about how we went about doing that, but I think it was entirely appropriate for the Fed to address the liquidity issues in the midst of the crisis. We did what a central bank ought to do.But by 2010 we weren\u2019t in a financial crisis anymore. My own view is that the rationale switched completely. It was no longer about providing liquidity; it was about providing stimulus at the zero lower bound.I think the benefits were small. I haven\u2019t changed my view about the benefits. And I think the jury is still out on the costs. Because the cost I was worried about was the longer-term cost of unraveling all of this. So maybe I was right, maybe I was wrong. That remains to be seen.I do worry about the longer-term implications for the institution. Part of my criticism has been that we have pushed the boundaries into fiscal rather than monetary policy. That has brought us praise and opprobrium. Perhaps justifiably on both counts. I do wonder as I look down the road five or 10 years, how will that shape the institution? What happens to our independence? What happens to our ability to do things effectively? Given all that we\u2019ve done \u2014 maybe it was all for the best, but even if it was \u2014 are there going to be longer-term ramifications that we may end up regretting later?What comes next for Charles Plosser?Who knows? I\u2019m 66 and it\u2019s time to slow down a little bit. I will hang around teaching, writing, but who knows what opportunities will present themselves? I haven\u2019t made any commitments.

The desk bears the gentle clutter of somebody busy but not overwhelmed: a leaning stack of papers, a cup filled with too many pencils, a tangle of paper clips. The woman wears a plum-brown dress, cinched at the waist and unbuttoned at the collar, large button-pearl earrings and still more pearls looped around her neck, along with a gold pendant chain. With her hands clasped loosely in her lap, she smiles, her mouth curved into a languid grin.Helen Gurley Brown was 60 when this picture was taken, and she had reason to be pleased. She had been editing Cosmopolitan magazine for nearly two decades, bringing her mix of workplace confessionals and candid sex tips to a growing demographic of single working women. The photograph would be the cover of her next book, \u201cHaving It All: Love, Success, Sex, Money .\u2009.\u2009. Even if You\u2019re Starting With Nothing,\u201d published in 1982.Today, \u201chaving it all\u201d is evoked so frequently and facetiously that it has become akin to some malign joke \u2014 heard, hated, yet repeated ad nauseam. When the question is posed about whether women can \u201chave it all,\u201d the answer arrived at is typically no, along with some incredulous scolding of those women who ever had the nerve to think they could. (In an article titled \u201cWhy Men Still Can\u2019t Have It All,\u201d a correspondent for Esquire magazine expended some 6,000 words to complain that women were complaining too much.) \u201cPlease, let\u2019s stop talking about \u2018having it all\u2019 and start talking about the real challenges of \u2018doing it all,'\u2009\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand wrote in her recent book, \u201cOff the Sidelines,\u201d dismissing the phrase as \u201can absurd frame.\u201d Even Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning for the State Department, who has suggested that \u201chaving it all\u201d might sound less ridiculous if the American government offered more support for working parents, acknowledges that the term carries little currency these days; in a 2012 cover story for The Atlantic, she recalled that younger women would thank her for \u201cnot giving just one more fatuous \u2018You can have it all\u2019 talk.\u201dThe popular thinking is that the term went from empowering to delusional, running up against the hard truths of reality to get worn down to the spurious fantasy underneath. Feminists, according to this narrative, were the ones who promised women they could have it all \u2014 rewarding career, loving partner, cheerful brood \u2014 and then couldn\u2019t deliver. Conservatives have been particularly enamored of this story. \u201cFeminist groups like to pretend that women can have it all without sacrificing time with families,\u201d Carrie L. Lukas, a managing director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, wrote in her 2006 book about feminism. The Federalist peddled a similar argument: \u201cWomen ask about having it all because they were told they could have it all .\u2009.\u2009. by women like [Gloria] Steinem.\u201dOnce you start digging into the origins of the phrase, however, this narrative begins to unravel. \u201cHaving it all,\u201d at least as it applies to women and work, has a relatively limited pedigree. Ruth Rosen, a scholar who has written extensively about the history of feminism, told me that you can\u2019t find much archival evidence of the phrase before the tail end of the 1970s \u2014 and even then, it wasn\u2019t so much a feminist mantra as a marketing pitch directed toward the well-heeled \u201cliberated\u201d consumer. In 1980, two years before Brown\u2019s book, Joyce Gabriel and Bettye Baldwin published \u201cHaving It All: A Practical Guide to Managing a Home and a Career\u201d; true to its promise, Gabriel and Baldwin\u2019s book offers straightforward tips on how a working mother might make the most of her scarce time. (\u201cStrive to do two things at once,\u201d the authors advise, like letting your nail polish set while you blow-dry your hair.) Women\u2019s magazines and Madison Avenue might have been selling the concept, but it was after Brown\u2019s book landed on the best-seller list, Rosen says, that the phrase gathered real cultural momentum, becoming shorthand for having kids and a career.What\u2019s more, the book\u2019s title wasn\u2019t her idea. She detested it. Her biographer, Jennifer Scanlon, told me that months before \u201cHaving It All\u201d was published, Brown wrote a letter to her editors pleading with them to use the title she wanted, \u201cThe Mouseburger Plan.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always always visualized this as a book for the downtrodden,\u201d Brown said, \u201ca book by a near loser who got to be a winner, instead of somebody who sounds \u2014 based on the title \u2014 like a smartass all-the-time winner from the beginning.\u201d (Which might explain the surprisingly cozy cover image; the photographer, Klaus Lucka, told me that Brown was adamant about the d\u00e9cor. It conveys, he said, the warmth of a \u201csuburban home office\u201d rather than anything too corporate and sleek.) She conceded that she would accept her editors\u2019 choice, but not before emphatically reiterating her objections: \u201c\u2009'Having It All\u2019 sounds so [expletive] clich\u00e9 to me.\u201dAnd there you have it \u2014 we somehow took a puffed-up corporate come-on, one that made Brown herself chafe more than 30 years ago, and twisted it in the collective memory into a false promise of feminism. The built-in vapidity, the vagueness with which \u201chaving it all\u201d specifies everything and therefore nothing, allows us to talk as if we know everything we need to know about working mothers while saying nothing substantive about the particular challenges they face. To say that women expect to \u201chave it all\u201d is to trivialize issues like parental leave, equal pay and safe, affordable child care; it makes women sound like entitled, narcissistic battle-axes while also casting them as fools.This rewriting of recent history that blames the women\u2019s movement for women\u2019s troubles is just one part of the \u201cbacklash\u201d that Susan Faludi wrote about more than two decades ago. It is a self-perpetuating feedback loop of distortions and half-truths. The false accusation of betrayal has \u201ca way of turning women away from making demands on society,\u201d Rosen says. The real betrayal lies not with the women\u2019s movement but with those who would rather keep us distracted by a never-ending sideshow than pay attention to the world as it really is.Jennifer Szalai is an editor at The New York Times\nBook Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Nazis Never Die", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisAS the decades roll by, there are fewer and fewer Nazi war criminals left alive to track down. Which made the recent reports suggesting that Alois Brunner, the top lieutenant to Adolf Eichmann, may have died as recently as a few years ago in his late 90s all the more surprising. Even more startling for many, though, was the fact that he wasn\u2019t hiding in Argentina or Brazil but in Damascus, Syria, where he had lived from the 1950s under the name Georg Fischer. Apparently, he may have even advised the Syrian government, according to Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center\u2019s Israel office (though without the benefit of an eye and three fingers he lost opening letter bombs over the years).It turns out Mr. Brunner wasn\u2019t an anomaly. Many of the most notorious Nazi fugitives \u2014 members of the SS and the Gestapo \u2014 fled to South America after the war, but hundreds fanned out through the Middle East, primarily to Egypt and Syria. Eichmann was captured by the Mossad in Buenos Aires and brought back to Israel for trial and execution. But his deputy, Mr. Brunner, was among those who carved out new lives in the Middle East, where governments sometimes recruited them to build up military and intelligence programs. A few years ago, as The Times\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, I worked with a colleague on an article about the most-wanted Nazi in the world, Dr. Aribert Heim. Investigators and Nazi hunters were searching for him in Chile, but we discovered that Heim had absconded to Egypt, converted to Islam and quietly lived out his days in a working-class neighborhood of Cairo.Like Brunner, he was part of a wave of German soldiers and scientists who made their way to North Africa and the Middle East. Leaders in Egypt and Syria especially viewed the Germans as more sympathetic to their aspirations than Britain and France, which still had significant interests in the region. During World War II, many Arab nationalists hoped the German field marshal Erwin Rommel would sweep the Allies out of the Middle East. That respect for German military might and expertise survived the fall of the Third Reich. Following the defeat of the Arab coalition by the Israelis in 1948, German advisers were discreetly sought out as the best resources for building new, stronger armies. In a French documentary last year, \u201cThe Nazi Exiles: The Promise of the Orient,\u201d the French-German filmmaker G\u00e9raldine Schwarz traced the paths of German soldiers of fortune, fugitives and propagandists, including Lt. Gen. Artur Schmitt, who fought with Rommel in North Africa. The Arab League recruited Schmitt to help form a more effective fighting force. After a trip to the Golan Heights in 1951, Schmitt wrote to an Egyptian colleague that the Arab defeat by Israel had been \u201cthe consequence of Egyptian leaders\u2019 inability to take advantage of the early stages of fighting to wipe the state of Israel off the map with a blitzkrieg of two weeks at most.\u201dMeanwhile, a Syrian agent traveled to Rome to seek out Walter Rauff, who helped develop the vans used as mobile gas chambers, to lead a search for military and intelligence advisers. Within months dozens of Nazis made their way to Damascus, including Franz Stangl, who had commanded the Sobibor death camp. More than 50 Germans were known to have gone to Syria, while at least 70 more went to Egypt. Many fugitives, like Heim, converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names, making them more difficult to track. In most cases, the recruitment of people accused of war crimes was kept discreet. Yet many of the Germans in 1950s Cairo, known as the \u201cAlemanni,\u201d lived openly as they helped modernize and train the Egyptian army. Their ample salaries arrived half in Egyptian pounds at local banks and half in francs sent to Swiss bank accounts. They rented luxury apartments, drove Mercedes-Benzes on their weekend trips to the Red Sea and had memberships at country clubs.In some cases they were merely following the jobs. With military activity suspended in postwar West Germany, a career officer had few options but to find a new profession or seek his fortune abroad. In her film, Ms. Schwarz tracked down the villa in Cairo where Dr. Wilhelm Voss, a leader of the German defense economy and former SS standartenf\u00fchrer, lived with his entourage. The Waffen-SS member and German Special Forces commando Gerhard Mertins trained Egyptian paratroopers but also represented German businesses like Mercedes and Siemens.Often enough the government in Bonn was happy to see its former soldiers at work in the Egyptian capital, as long as their Nazi pasts did not cause embarrassment. \u201cContact with the German military advisers\u201d led to \u201ca fundamentally positive attitude toward the Federal Republic, which has repeatedly made itself felt agreeably in negotiations,\u201d a staff member at the German Embassy in Cairo wrote in 1957. Some, like the propagandist Johann von Leers, remained committed Nazis and anti-Semites, and were well aware that Egyptian leaders hoped to avenge the humiliating defeat by Israel. Dr. Hans Eisele, twice convicted for crimes as a concentration camp physician, fled to Cairo as investigators once again closed in on him. When the West German government demanded that the Egyptians extradite him, they bluntly refused.The Israelis were concerned enough about the Cairo Germans \u2014 in particular their missile-making expertise \u2014 to dispatch an undercover agent to Cairo. A letter bomb nearly blinded the German secretary working for one of the rocket scientists. Another device addressed to Dr. Eisele exploded prematurely in the hand of his Egyptian postman. But by and large they escaped retribution. The question for future researchers is how much influence the Germans had over these rapidly changing nations and their security apparatus. \u201cThe world as it is today was shaped after World War II, so the \u201950s are a really key era,\u201d Ms. Schwarz said by telephone from Berlin. \u201cThe Germans were advising the army, the secret service and the police at the moment when these countries were being built.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hating Good Government", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf course not. Evidence doesn\u2019t matter for the \u201cdebate\u201d over climate policy, where I put scare quotes around \u201cdebate\u201d because, given the obvious irrelevance of logic and evidence, it\u2019s not really a debate in any normal sense. And this situation is by no means unique. Indeed, at this point it\u2019s hard to think of a major policy dispute where facts actually do matter; it\u2019s unshakable dogma, across the board. And the real question is why.Before I get into that, let me remind you of some other news that won\u2019t matter.So will we see conservatives scaling back their claims about the magical efficacy of tax cuts as a form of economic stimulus? Of course not. If evidence mattered, supply-side economics would have faded into obscurity decades ago. Instead, it has only strengthened its grip on the Republican Party.All this is utterly at odds with dire predictions that reform would lead to declining coverage and soaring costs. So will we see any of the people claiming that Obamacare is doomed to utter failure revising their position? You know the answer.And the list goes on. On issues that range from monetary policy to the control of infectious disease, a big chunk of America\u2019s body politic holds views that are completely at odds with, and completely unmovable by, actual experience. And no matter the issue, it\u2019s the same chunk. If you\u2019ve gotten involved in any of these debates, you know that these people aren\u2019t happy warriors; they\u2019re red-faced angry, with special rage directed at know-it-alls who snootily point out that the facts don\u2019t support their position.The question, as I said at the beginning, is why. Why the dogmatism? Why the rage? And why do these issues go together, with the set of people insisting that climate change is a hoax pretty much the same as the set of people insisting that any attempt at providing universal health insurance must lead to disaster and tyranny?Well, it strikes me that the immovable position in each of these cases is bound up with rejecting any role for government that serves the public interest. If you don\u2019t want the government to impose controls or fees on polluters, you want to deny that there is any reason to limit emissions. If you don\u2019t want the combination of regulation, mandates and subsidies that is needed to extend coverage to the uninsured, you want to deny that expanding coverage is even possible. And claims about the magical powers of tax cuts are often little more than a mask for the real agenda of crippling government by starving it of revenue. Whether this is the right explanation or not, the fact is that we\u2019re living in a political era in which facts don\u2019t matter. This doesn\u2019t mean that those of us who care about evidence should stop seeking it out. But we should be realistic in our expectations, and not expect even the most decisive evidence to make much difference.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Gomorrah\u2019: Italy\u2019s Criminally Great TV Show", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAPLES, Italy \u2014 \u201cGomorrah,\u201d which recounts the exploits of the fictional Savastanos crime family, is Italy\u2019s all-time most popular TV series. And it is starting to go global: Twelve of the first episodes have already been sold for broadcast in 50 countries. \u201cGomorrah\u201d will tell world viewers a great story. But what will it tell them about Italy itself?The Savastanos are part of the Camorra, Naples\u2019s version of the Mafia. The boss, Pietro, is married to Imma; their son is Gennaro, better known as Genny. Ciro is their go-to hit man, and Salvatore Conte is their rival. These meticulous, over-the-top killers manage to square a love of music with violence, drug dealing, exotic interior d\u00e9cor, devotion to the saints and a passion for firearms. The setting is the outskirts of Naples, a tangle of overpasses, badly lit parking lots and outsize concrete housing projects, including the infamous Le Vele. Occasionally, as contrast, a picture-postcard Mediterranean appears in the background, the view tourists see on their way to the Amalfi Coast. \u201cGomorrah,\u201d based on the best-selling book of the same name by the journalist Roberto Saviano, takes its title from the sinful city in the Bible; handily, it also rhymes with Camorra. The Italy that \u201cGomorrah\u201d portrays is squalid, brutal and comes as a surprise to some. \u201cFor those of us who romanticize Italy, \u2018Gomorrah\u2019 is a fizzing antidote,\u201d according to London\u2019s Daily Telegraph. It\u2019s not the first time that Italian-style criminality has inspired spectacular artistic results. From \u201cThe Godfather\u201d to \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d filmmakers have long worked with Mafia-centered plots. Television came along later, but has shown equal enthusiasm. Six seasons and 86 episodes, running from 1999 to 2007, made \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d an enviable success. That chronicle of an Italian-American family exemplified the mix of dishonesty and sympathy, love and cruelty, that allegedly runs through Italian organized crime, and it quickly won over millions of international viewers.\u201cGomorrah\u201d is more realistic. The criminals aren\u2019t glorified; there are no lovable monsters like Tony Soprano. Its story lines are fictional, but they draw on current events. With stunning camerawork, fast-paced tempos and well-written dialogue that rolls out in accurately rendered Neapolitan Italian, it is proof, if proof were needed, that Italians can turn out first-rate television. Before shooting \u201cGomorrah,\u201d the director Stefano Sollima had made the popular Rome-based TV series \u201cRomanzo Criminale\u201d (\u201cCriminal Novel\u201d). Before that, Mr. Sollima worked as a cameraman for global news networks like CNN, NBC and CBS, sometimes in war zones. In short, Italy has created a popular, realistic, beautifully rendered TV series \u2014 which is what has so many people worried. The international success of \u201cGomorrah\u201d could turn into bad publicity for Naples and Italy, just as the young government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is trying so hard to restore confidence among foreigners. Italy has worked hard to move beyond the national stereotype of the unprincipled, untrustworthy wheeler-dealer toting a pistol in one hand and a plate of spaghetti (or, in \u201cGomorrah,\u201d a fried fish) in the other. The very realism that critics and viewers love could easily backfire, reinforcing the idea that something is rotten in the state of Italy.Similar charges were leveled at \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which is set in New Jersey. The Italian-American community took umbrage, claiming the series fostered the worst clich\u00e9s to the point of being defamatory. The National Italian American Foundation and Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, protested. The cast members were kept away from Columbus Day parades. In 2001, a PublicMind poll reported that viewers who watched \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d tended to regard Italian-Americans and New Jersey negatively. Will \u201cGomorrah\u201d do the same for the city and people of Naples?Many of my compatriots are wringing their hands over this question. But I think their concerns are, fortunately, misplaced, precisely because of the show\u2019s realism. The Savastanos are not going to be the new Sopranos. Characters in \u201cGomorrah\u201d compel \u2014 as they do in any good TV series \u2014 but they don\u2019t charm. Empathy is absent. \u201cGomorrah\u201d hasn\u2019t got goodies and baddies; just baddies and worsies. Viewers observe and learn, but don\u2019t identify with them. And what they learn is that Italy, like every other society on Earth, has a dark side. But \u201cGomorrah\u201d also makes clear that this is just a \u201cside,\u201d that it is not all of Italy. The Naples in which the criminals operate is also shown to have the second-largest passenger port in the world, Italy\u2019s fourth-largest urban economy and Europe\u2019s largest historic center, a Unesco World Heritage site. The realism in \u201cGomorrah\u201d is never lurid or sensational; it is measured, so that viewers sense that there is a world beyond it, an Italy that is not about corruption and murder. In this way, it is more like \u201cThe Wire,\u201d David Simon\u2019s masterpiece about drugs, cops and poverty in Baltimore. As tightly focused as that series is, there is always a sense that there is more to the city, and to American society, than cocaine, graft and guns. So my fellow Italians should just relax, and enjoy some great TV. Camorra is bad for Italy. \u201cGomorrah\u201d isn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Battle for Ukraine ", "Date": "2015-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCAN a group of young reformers fix a broken country?That is the question that Dmytro Shymkiv, the first deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, is getting a lot these days. About a year ago, Mr. Shymkiv was running Microsoft in Ukraine and pondering accepting a promotion to the company\u2019s offices in Latin America. But history intervened. A mass protest movement toppled Ukraine\u2019s government last February, precipitating some of the most momentous events of Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet life: a rethinking of its national identity, a war with Russia and the effective loss of control over a slice of eastern territory.Now Mr. Shymkiv, 39, is helping to steer reform in Ukraine, a task that on some days seems exhilarating, and on others impossible.\u201cIf you told me a year ago that I would be in the government, I would have said you are out of your mind,\u201d Mr. Shymkiv said by telephone last month from his office in Kiev. \u201cI\u2019m working in an international corporation with great career development prospects and I\u2019m going to do what?\u201dThe war in eastern Ukraine, still grinding on despite a September cease-fire, may have captured the world\u2019s attention. But just as important for the country\u2019s future is what is happening in a handful of offices in Kiev, where a small team of young reformers has recently gotten to work.They say they want to save their country by transforming it into something it has never been: honest. The task goes far beyond economic tinkering. It requires a fundamental shift in the way society and the state interact, a rewiring of the assumption \u2014 nearly universal in post-Soviet societies \u2014 that you may as well grab what you can today, because everything might be taken away tomorrow.It is a tall order. No former Soviet republic (with the exception of the Baltic States) has managed to fundamentally remake itself and rid itself of corruption, much less one that is this important (50 million people on the edge of Europe and NATO). Ukraine itself has failed on many occasions, most recently in 2005, and anyone with a sense of history is asking why this time would be any different. What is more, Ukraine\u2019s old guard still forms the flesh and bones of the bureaucracy. \u201cThere is this tendency to either see the second coming of Christ or the apocalypse when it comes to change in Ukraine,\u201d said Samuel Charap, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cBut the reality up till now is that they have always muddled through.\u201dBut there may now be a moment for change. Ukraine\u2019s economy is in withdrawal from its long-term addiction to cheap Russian gas. Russia has gobbled up chunks of its territory, including a quarter of its export muscle. And with Russia no longer willing to foot the bill, Ukraine is asking the West for money, but the war and economic losses have increased its needs and there are doubts about whether the West will come through in time. In a strange twist, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is both the man who most wants change stopped and the one who has created the best opportunity for it. The war frightened everyone, including people in Ukraine\u2019s south and east who for decades had been deeply ambivalent about being Ukrainian.It has also electrified a new generation of activists, who are the moral conscience of the new government, watching what it does from their seats in Parliament and reporting back to the public, like a Greek chorus. (Recent stunts include throwing rotten tomatoes at a board stapled with politicians\u2019 faces.)So who are Ukraine\u2019s reformers? Many have come from business. Most came of age in the twilight of the Soviet Union. A number of them ran investment funds. There is even a Ukrainian-American, Natalie Jaresko, from Chicago, who moved to Ukraine in the early 1990s to work for the American government. She is now finance minister.\u201cThe type of people coming in are very different from what I\u2019ve seen before in Ukrainian politics,\u201d said Erik Berglof, director of the Institute for Global Affairs at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are young. Many were trained abroad. Most are well off. They are from business and many have run complex organizations.\u201dAnders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, pointed out that only two of the new ministers do not speak English, the opposite of the previous government in which only two ministers did speak English. For Mr. Shymkiv, even the smallest changes have been difficult. Only half of the more than 400 employees of the presidential administration had ever used email (a third had never used a computer), and getting them to overcome their strong affection for the fax machine has been hard. A person of the wired world, Mr. Shymkiv is using a Windows smartphone in an office where giant Soviet telephones sit like bricks on his desk.One immediate problem is cash. The country is running on fumes in terms of hard currency reserves, in part a result of a large payment recently to Russia for its gas debt. Without a substantial cash infusion from the International Monetary Fund, the country is likely to suffer an economic meltdown, with far-reaching consequences for its currency, banking system and its new government\u2019s reputation. Russia\u2019s wobbly finances do not help \u2014 about a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s exports go to Russia.One big test for the new government will be Igor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian oligarch whose PrivatBank, one of the largest commercial banks in the country, is at the center of a murky web of financial transactions, symbolizing much of what is wrong with the Ukrainian banking industry. Taking him on will be complicated: He is a friend of the new government and the revolution that put it there. He is governor of the eastern region of Dnepropetrovsk.

{"Headline": "As New Leadership Takes Over in Washington, a Major Fiscal Clash Takes Shape", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will propose breaching statutory spending caps in the fiscal year that begins in October, putting out a budget Monday that raises spending at Congress\u2019s discretion by $74 billion \u2014 or 7 percent, the White House announced Thursday.With the era of falling budget deficits coming to an end, Mr. Obama and Congress are hurtling toward a major fiscal clash over spending as the White House and Democrats press for an easing of fiscal spending austerity just as Republicans redouble efforts to balance the budget.The president\u2019s budget would raise military spending next year by $37 billion over caps set in the 2011 Budget Control Act, a measure reached after hard-fought negotiations with the new Republican-led House. Domestic spending would rise $38 billion over the cap for fiscal 2016.While both sides say they are trying to aim their policies at the squeezed middle class, the divide between the two parties on actual fiscal policy may be as stark as any time since Bill Clinton\u2019s first term and government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. Since then, Washington policy makers have been focused either on issues like national defense, financial crises and recession or at least on professing a common goal of balanced budgets and fiscal rectitude.But solid economic numbers and new leadership on important congressional committees have driven the parties apart. As one senior Democratic budget aide said, \u201cWe\u2019re on different planets.\u201d\u201cCongress is under new management, and so is this committee,\u201d Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Wednesday at the panel\u2019s first hearing of the new Congress. \u201cI intend to run a budget committee dedicated to the proposition that we must confront spending, bring the deficit to an end and, ultimately, balance the budget.\u201dSenator Bernard Sanders, a liberal independent from Vermont and the panel\u2019s new ranking member, retorted: \u201cThere are other deficits in our society that have been causing horrendous pain for the vast majority of the American people. These are deficits in decent-paying jobs, deficits in infrastructure, deficits in income, deficits in equality.\u201dIt is not just Mr. Sanders. Mr. Obama and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, are pushing measures to raise taxes on the rich to bolster the incomes of middle-class families. Democrats on the budget committee were once led by moderate fiscal hawks; now, the ranking members are far more liberal.And while Republicans are also speaking more about wage stagnation and income inequality, the party remains united around a traditional platform of spending constraint and deficit reduction, which leaders still say is the answer to sluggish growth and bridging the divide in incomes.A series of fiscal showdowns is coming, starting with an end to Department of Homeland Security funding on Feb. 28, a sharp cut in physician payments under Medicare on March 31, the depletion of the highway trust fund on May 31, a debt-ceiling showdown this summer or fall and the return of across-the-board mandatory cuts known as sequestration on Oct. 1.If those cuts happen, \u201cwe will not be able to defeat an adversary, deny another adversary and defend the homeland,\u201d Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, the Air Force chief of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. \u201cI do not believe that is good for America.\u201dHelene Cooper contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And, he told an audience at the German Council on Foreign Relations, a nongovernmental group, that \u201csanctions are extremely important\u201d to keep the pressure on Russia.On Wednesday, as the Ukrainian prime minister headed to Germany, at least three official German websites went offline after an apparent effort by hackers who demanded that Berlin cease support for the government in Kiev.

According to Germany\u2019s Office for Security in Information Technology, or B.S.I., hackers regularly try to attack government websites, including daily attempts by what the office believes to be a foreign intelligence agency. The office was investigating the attack.Ms. Merkel gave the Ukrainian leader a warm welcome at her chancellery, and she reiterated that \u201cGermany will continue to do everything to support Ukraine.\u201dMr. Yatsenyuk had outlined impressive overhauls, she said. The Ukrainian leader is seeking additional credit to deal with current bailout payments, even as his country struggles to come to grips with entrenched problems such as corruption, tax evasion and lagging government asset sales. Many creditors fear that Ukraine is not moving swiftly enough to enact needed economic changes.Germany agreed on Wednesday to guarantee credit worth 500 million euros, or nearly $593 million, for Ukraine, contingent on prior approval for the specific use of the funds, said Beate Braams, a spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry. The German government is seeking prior approval to ensure that the funds are not used for any military purpose.Mr. Yatsenyuk, in his appearance at the foreign policy society, encouraged Germans to do business in his country, lamenting that only 400 or so German firms were active in Ukraine, compared to a reported 8,000 in Romania.He and Andriy Kobolyev, head of Ukraine\u2019s state gas company, Naftogaz, also insisted that Ukraine is cleaning up its corrupt gas industry and encouraged more German and European involvement in that field.Before winter, Germany and the European Union helped Russia and Ukraine negotiate a difficult agreement on natural gas deliveries from Russia, both to Ukraine and in transit to other European countries. The agreement runs until March 31.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Garbage Incinerators Make Comeback, Kindling Both Garbage and Debate", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new waste-to-energy incinerator plant has been proposed in the Curtis Bay neighborhood of Baltimore. The area already hosts a 200-acre coal pier, seen here in the background, across the street from the Curtis Bay Recreation Center.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Rising from a denuded landscape not far from this area\u2019s famed beaches, the nation\u2019s first new commercial garbage incinerator in 20 years is about to be fired up, ready to blast up to 3,000 tons of trash a day into electricity for thousands of houses.\u201cPeople said 30 years ago there wouldn\u2019t be a need to have waste-to-energy sites,\u201d said Ted Michaels, president of the Energy Recovery Council, a trade association, recalling optimism over garbage reduction and vast increases in recycling. Today, few other options are available.But while the Environmental Protection Agency has given its seal of approval by classifying the new plants as renewable energy \u2014 akin to solar and wind power \u2014 the facilities are an expensive and perhaps risky gamble.Environmental groups oppose them, saying that although cleaner than the incinerators of the past, waste-to-energy plants still emit mercury, lead, dioxins and a variety of other toxic substances. And the history of incineration offers a cautionary tale, producing alarm among some who live nearby.In the Curtis Bay neighborhood of Baltimore, for example, a waste-to-energy plant is being built at an expected cost of $1 billion, and concerns about its viability and health risks are mounting.The plant will be even larger than the one about to open in West Palm Beach, able to combust 4,000 tons of material per day processed from residential garbage, wood, tires and the remains of automobiles.The problem is that Curtis Bay already hosts a 200-acre coal pier that produces black dust that collects on local streets and drifts inside windows, a fertilizer plant reeking of fresh manure, one of the nation\u2019s largest medical waste incinerators, chemical plants, fuel depots, and an open-air composting site.The M.I.T. report found that 130 of every 100,000 Baltimore residents \u201clikely die in a given year due to long-term exposure to air pollution.\u201dThe proposed facility would be allowed to emit up to 240 pounds of mercury and 1,000 pounds of lead annually in a neighborhood with three schools and high rates of cancer and asthma.Donna Harrison, 51, who bought a $64,000 house in Curtis Bay with her husband in 2010, said she often saw dead birds on the street. And she spoke of a smell she described as being \u201clike road kill all blended up and someone took the lid off.\u201d\u201cWe thought about selling our house, but it\u2019s not feasible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now an incinerator? For the love of God. And not just an incinerator but the biggest damn incinerator in the United States. I feel I\u2019ve taken my $64,000 and burned it.\u201dOther residents say they are eager for the plant to be built, in part because Energy Answers has pledged to create jobs and signed an agreement promising at least $50,000 a year to be used for job training, low-interest home loans, G.E.D. courses and new recreational facilities once the plant opens. The agreement includes a provision that would require Energy Answers to pay a fine directly to the community if emission standards were exceeded.Andy Dize, president of the Community of Curtis Bay Association, said the plant would be a clear boon to the neighborhood, given the agreement and the promised jobs. \u201cThere\u2019s always got to be some give and take, and Curtis Bay will be worse off if this isn\u2019t built,\u201d he said.The Florida plant, topped by an 80-foot smokestack, has encountered far less opposition, though there has been dissent over a plan to accept trash from outside Palm Beach County for at least eight years, until the county\u2019s population catches up with the incinerator\u2019s capacity.Some residents have said the plant \u2014 and the garbage trucks going back and forth along Jog Road \u2014 could besmirch the area\u2019s reputation and harm tourism.\u201cDo we really want to be the trash capital of South Florida?\u201d asked Donald E. Gundermann, a West Palm Beach resident. He said he did not object to the incinerator, but did oppose importing garbage from outside the county.Mark Hammond, executive director of the county\u2019s Solid Waste Authority, said the incinerator was the best available way to dispose of waste \u2014 and a far better solution than placing a new landfill near the Everglades, which was the county\u2019s original plan.\u201cThis will be the cleanest waste-to-energy plant in the United States,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.Though recycling rose steadily during the 1990s \u2014 the national recycling and composting rate jumped to 31.4 percent in 2005 from 16 percent in 1990 \u2014 curbside recycling has more recently been deemed an expensive luxury by a number of municipalities.\u201cSome parts of the country realized it was costlier than they\u2019d anticipated,\u201d he said, \u201cand it really comes down to economies of scale. The more people who take part, the less expensive it becomes.\u201dBaltimore and Palm Beach County each have recycling rates of about 30 percent. If, as expected, the national rates continue to lag, new incinerators will probably be part of the solution.\u201cWe\u2019ve been building plants around the world, so the technology is there,\u201d said Larry A. Hiner, a manager with Babcock & Wilcox, the North Carolina-based company building the Florida plant. \u201cI think with education the public\u2019s perception of waste-to-energy will change. Time is on our side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, in Bid to Ease Home Buying, Cuts Mortgage Insurance Rate", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 President Obama announced on Thursday new measures to try to assist a still-sluggish housing market, even as he hailed an economic recovery that he said was finally roaring ahead.Speaking in Arizona, a state that was hit hard by the country\u2019s mortgage crisis, Mr. Obama said his decision to lower insurance rates on federally issued mortgages would make purchasing a home cheaper for hundreds of thousands of people across the country.\u201cHundreds of thousands of new buyers is going to mean a healthier housing market for everyone,\u201d Mr. Obama told a small crowd of supporters in the Central High School gymnasium. \u201cWe do want to make sure that the housing market is strong and that responsible homeowners can get a good deal.\u201dThe president said the changes would help improve an economy that was already on the rebound. He said the country had added jobs, lowered the cost of gas and insured more people since he came into office.\u201cLet there be no doubt. Thanks to the steps we took to rescue our economy, to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real.\u201dThe president is hoping that the modest move on housing \u2014 it could produce savings of about $900 for each home buyer \u2014 will help address tighter lending that has made home loans harder to come by for many people, one of the lingering effects of the economic collapse in 2008.Mr. Obama is also using the housing action to underscore what the White House says is a continuing effort to address financial concerns of the middle class. Officials said the housing announcement was the first in a series of \u201cS.O.T.U. spoilers\u201d that the president will reveal in a series of speeches leading up to the State of the Union address in front of Congress.On Wednesday, the president was in Detroit talking about the recovery of the auto industry and the broader manufacturing sector. In a speech in Knoxville, Tenn., on Friday, Mr. Obama is expected to announce measures intended to make college more affordable.The speech in Phoenix is a return to a state that was devastated by the nation\u2019s mortgage and foreclosure crisis. In February 2009, barely a month into his presidency, Mr. Obama traveled to Mesa, Ariz., near Phoenix, to announce a plan to confront what he called \u201ca crisis that strikes at the heart of the middle class.\u201dAt the time, homes across Phoenix were dropping into foreclosure as the housing bubble burst nationally. In his 2009 remarks, Mr. Obama noted that \u201chome values have fallen so sharply that even if you make a large down payment, the current value of your mortgage may still be higher than the current value of your house.\u201dHe added, \u201cSo no bank will return your calls, and no sale will return your investment.\u201dSix years later, the president\u2019s message was more upbeat. He said that the nation\u2019s economic recovery had helped lift property values and that financial regulations put in place by his administration had helped bring stability to the banking system.But he acknowledged that the housing market continued to be tough, especially for first-time home buyers. Finding a bank willing to offer a mortgage can be tricky he said, denying the American dream to many in the middle class. He said his new measures would help.\u201cIt means fewer foreclosure signs, it means more construction, which means more jobs,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis is the kind of boost we need to keep the momentum we\u2019ve seen, to keep it going.\u201dIn Washington, Speaker John A. Boehner said the president was bragging about an \u201ceconomy that we all know could be doing better.\u201d And he criticized the president for not visiting the Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix that was at the heart of a scandal involving delayed care.\u201cThe system is still broken, and needs to be fundamentally transformed in a way that puts the needs of veterans before the needs of the bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cWe call on the president to offer a long-term vision for reforming the systemic problems at the V.A.

{"Headline": "Mr. Maduro in His Labyrinth", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPosters of his predecessor also abounded when Mr. Maduro, a former bus driver, arrived home to a carnival-like welcome, as he drove the lead coach of a convoy that snaked through crowds of supporters. Since he was voted into office in April 2013 by a minuscule margin after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death, Mr. Maduro has leaned heavily on the legacy of his predecessor, a populist who governed poorly but had magnetic charisma and shrewd political instincts. Woefully lacking on both fronts, Mr. Maduro has become increasingly erratic and despotic in a quest for political survival that seems more daunting by the day. Healthy oil export revenue allowed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to build a robust network of patronage and create generous welfare programs during his 14 years in power. Those are becoming increasingly paltry on Mr. Maduro\u2019s watch. Mr. Maduro has been vague about the type of painful economic measures his government has been willing to embrace, yet he bafflingly has promised to expand social programs and raise salaries. Far from acknowledging responsibility for the crisis, he and his loyalists have blamed the revenue shortfalls on political opponents they accuse of enabling an international conspiracy. They have jailed one of the most prominent figures in the opposition, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, since last February on trumped up charges of stoking violent protests a year ago. During Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s Kafkaesque trial, which is still in process, prosecutors have argued that he instigated bloodshed through subliminal messages. The crackdown on the opposition, unobstructed by a weak and compromised press, appears to be an effort to divert attention from Venezuelans\u2019 deteriorating quality of life. Security forces have been deployed to maintain order outside supermarkets, where people line up for hours to scrounge whatever is left on depleted shelves. On a recent afternoon, a Venezuelan woman who had been waiting in line since 4 a.m. showed a television journalist from Al Jazeera English her forearm, where someone had written the number 413 with a black marker to establish her place in line. \u201cNow we are like cattle,\u201d the woman lamented. \u201cThis must end.\u201d Hours later, Mr. Maduro\u2019s government responded with its standard effort to find a scapegoat for the national calamity.

{"Headline": "Five Surprising Economic Trends in 2014, and What They Mean for 2015", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal MarketsIt was a confounding year in global financial markets. Not because it was a disaster for most investors; American stocks and bonds both rose in value. It was confounding because of some major moves that defied expert consensus this time a year ago \u2014 not only what was predicted, but what was even thought plausible.But by understanding what the biggest market moves were, you can also understand the forces that will shape the global economy in 2015.There was an epic collapse in oil prices.It\u2019s not that the price of oil has never moved as far and as fast as it did in 2014. It\u2019s just that usually when that happens, it occurs against the backdrop of much more global volatility, like in a worldwide recession at the end of 2008 and early 2009.What\u2019s remarkable about the roughly 50 percent decline in the price of oil in the second half of the year is that it occurred amid such stability; nothing radical changed in that time about either the global economic outlook or even the supply and demand picture for oil itself.Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off.We\u2019ve already started to see some of the geopolitical consequences of this shift, including the collapse in value of the ruble and new pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But that is probably only the beginning. The budgets of major oil producers, from Venezuela to Indonesia to Texas, will be stretched. Meanwhile, there will be a nice tailwind to growth around the world as cheaper fuel means higher real incomes for consumers.Long-term interest rates kept falling.That narrative was exactly right when it came to the economy and policy. The job market has strengthened, and the Fed has moved to end its interventions in the economy as planned. But the result for bond markets has been the opposite of the conventional wisdom.The yield on United States Treasury bonds fell significantly over the course of the year; the government can borrow money for 30 years for a mere 2.8 percent, down from 4 percent at the end of 2013. These lower costs have translated into cheaper home mortgages and lower borrowing costs for businesses, and higher bond prices (but lower future returns) for investors.Regardless of the cause, it raises the prospect that even as the economy continues to strengthen and the Fed raises rates in 2015, cheap longer-term rates will be here to stay.The U.S. stock market kept cruising.The stock market had a remarkable rally in 2013, and some were skeptical that it could continue the run in 2014.It did. But only in the United States.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 11.4 percent in 2014, not quite the 30 percent return of 2013 but not shabby by any measure. But while 2013 featured a broad rise among all the major global stock markets, the United States was a major outperformer in 2014.The core reason is that the American economy has performed better than its counterparts in much of the rest of the world, with Europe and Japan facing stagnant growth and emerging markets slowing their once-gangbuster pace. A related factor is that the dollar has appreciated compared with other currencies, so the dollars that American companies make are becoming relatively more valuable.Yet another year of stock prices that rise faster than corporate earnings certainly increases the risk of a sharp correction or a period of subpar returns. But in the meantime, Americans can take comfort in the fact that the referendum of global financial markets is that the United States will continue to be the driver of global economic recovery.The dollar soared.The same fundamentals that helped American stocks log another year of impressive returns drove up the dollar versus virtually all other major currencies \u2014 but a solid year for United States economic growth wasn\u2019t the entirety of the story.A schism has opened up between the Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to stimulate growth and fight deflation in their countries (the B.O.J. has already expanded its easing programs, and the E.C.B. appears on the verge of undertaking a form of bond-buying of its own). But the Fed has been signaling higher rates and tighter money.That has made the dollar more attractive, as has the sense that it is a beacon of economic strength in a troubled world economy. Those factors explain the 12 percent drop in the euro against the dollar and the 14 percent drop in the Japanese yen.But the strengthening dollar has implications for 2015 far beyond the finances of Americans thinking of visiting Paris this spring.If you are a company doing business in Mexico or South Korea, for example, and borrow money in dollars, a rising dollar makes repaying your debts more onerous and has the same effect as a hike in interest rates, potentially squeezing your cash flows or even leading to bankruptcy. Look for those ripple effects of a strong dollar across the globe in 2015.The outlook for inflation fell.Global investors are betting on very, very low inflation, for many years to come. That is the implication, anyway, of the relative prices of inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds in the United States and almost every other major economy.Part of this is easy to explain. The decline in oil and other commodity prices will put downward pressure on prices in 2015. But a broader shift in sentiment happened in recent months. Investors seem to think that very low inflation will persist even after the oil price declines of the last few months fully spread through other consumer prices. Bond prices currently imply that inflation from 2019 to 2024 will be 2.14 percent a year, down from 2.65 percent a year ago.Investor expectations suggest that the Fed may have more leeway than it had seemed a few months ago to keep interest rates low, especially if they see continued weakness in the economy.And given that similar trends are visible across the advanced world, it implies that one of the foremost challenges for policy is finding a way to get the world\u2019s major economies humming enough that deflation is no longer a concern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resistance From Right Slows G.O.P. Press to Redefine Full-Time Worker", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One of the new Republican Congress\u2019s first legislative priorities \u2014 redefining a full-time worker under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is gaining opposition just days before passage from a surprising group: conservatives.The House will take up legislation on Wednesday, the first major bill of the 114th Congress, that would change the definition of a full-time worker under the health law from one who works 30 hours a week to one who works 40 hours. A vote is scheduled for Thursday.\u201cPutting the cutoff for the employer mandate at 40 hours would likely put far, far more people at risk of having their hours cut than leaving it at 30 hours,\u201d Levin wrote. \u201cThat would make for a worse effect on workers and on the economy. So by setting the definition lower, Obamacare\u2019s architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some, and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects.\u201d Instead, he called for a full repeal of the employer coverage mandate.Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, drew more attention to the post when he took to Twitter to bolster Mr. Levin. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Republicans should be taking the lead in an alleged fix of Obamacare that I\u2019m not sure would improve it anyway,\u201d he said Monday.The dispute exemplifies how moving from a slogan to actual legislation may be more tricky for Republicans than they expected. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that\u2019s an easy change,\u201d said Joseph Antos, a health care analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about changing any one sentence in the Affordable Care Act.\u201dAnd the issue goes beyond the health care law.The House and Senate also will move almost immediately to approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 but at a time when the price of oil is so low, investment in Canadian tar sands is expected to dry up.The House on Tuesday will approve a new rule for the coming Congress mandating that the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate the cost of all \u201cmajor legislation\u201d factoring in the bill\u2019s impact on economic growth. That might make tax cuts appear less costly to the Treasury, but depending on how budget office fulfills it, the rule change could also make Democratic bills, like the major infrastructure legislation the House will introduce Tuesday, appear less expensive.Business groups say companies that employ low-wage, low-skilled workers are most likely to reduce their hours below the threshold to avoid the penalty, since such businesses are the most sensitive to worker costs.\u201cWhen you think about who we\u2019ve heard from, admittedly anecdotally, the biggest problem is for those workers traditionally not offered health insurance,\u201d said Katie W. Mahoney, executive director for health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.But other conservatives point to a simple fact: Far more Americans work 40 hours or more than those who work about 30.\u201cAt a full-time definition of 40 hours per week, there are more than twice as many workers at high risk of hours reductions because they are within five hours of the full-time definition at firms that do not offer health insurance coverage,\u201d the study concluded.As the job market strengthens, employers will be less inclined to cut hours or drop coverage because workers will be able to look elsewhere for better benefits, said Stuart Butler, who spent 35 years at the conservative Heritage Foundation before moving to the Brookings Institution.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing as much of a change of behavior among employers as some of us had feared,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cAnd I think that would be the case here, too.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about Republican efforts in Congress to pass legislation that would redefine a full-time worker under the Affordable Care Act misstated the timing of an article in National Review that addressed the issue of setting the cutoff at 40 hours versus 30 hours.

He now owns nearly 28 million shares in total.The company received more than $100 million in the transaction, it said, which it intends to use to repurchase Class A shares \u2014 a different category from the controlling Class B shares held by the Sulzberger family.Mr. Slim, who made his money in telecommunications across Latin America, is one of the world\u2019s richest people, worth about $72 billion, according to Forbes. He lent the Times Company $250 million, at an interest rate of 14 percent, in 2009; at the time, with the world economy struggling and credit tight, the company looked to be in peril. The loan was repaid in 2011, more than three years before it was due. But the warrants, which expired this month, were issued in connection with that deal.\u201cThe option is a lower price,\u201d Mr. Slim said in an interview with Reuters last July. \u201cI\u2019m sure we should exercise the option, but we look at it like a financial investment that has been very good.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares ended trading on Wednesday at $12.28.The Times Company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thompson, said in a statement that a repurchasing of shares was the best use of the cash from Mr. Slim.\u201cWe believe it is in the best interests of the company to continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet, and a prudent view on the allocation of free cash flow,\u201d he said, \u201cand this one-off repurchase program should not be viewed as a change of position about our capital allocation plans.\u201dThe company recently completed a round of buyouts and layoffs in the newsroom of The New York Times after a year of tumult. Last May, Jill Abramson was dismissed as executive editor and replaced with her deputy, Dean Baquet.New ventures like iPhone apps failed to generate significant immediate revenue. Though its digital subscriptions have grown, The Times has been scrambling to make up for the declines in lucrative print advertising that have rocked traditional news organizations as online outlets, and social media, have proliferated.In a call with analysts late last year, Mr. Thompson said the new products reflected a desire to be \u201cunashamedly experimental and willing to adapt.\u201d The chief financial officer, James M. Follo, said the company was \u201cstill in the early stages of a multiyear transformation.\u201dSince taking over the newsroom leadership, Mr. Baquet has invested in an audience development team with the aim of broadening the reach of Times journalism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro and Immigration Promise Challenges for Merkel in 2015 ", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BerlinBERLIN \u2014 Although she is still popular at home and respected abroad, Chancellor Angela Merkel is entering 2015 facing fresh challenges in both arenas.Greece\u2019s crisis threatens once more to undermine the euro and exacerbate tensions between Berlin and the European Central Bank. In Germany itself, her response to the rise of anti-immigration protests has produced a rare attack from within the chancellor\u2019s conservative camp, and posed the perennial question about how best to confront any sentiment on the far right.Might her 10th year in power be the year Ms. Merkel loses her touch?As one year melted into another, Ms. Merkel showed her hand with an unusually direct riposte to anti-immigrant protesters in Dresden, whose ranks swelled to 17,500 last month. Don\u2019t go to these marches, she warned Germans in her New Year\u2019s address, because the organizers have \u201cprejudice, coldness and even hatred in their hearts.\u201dThat challenge will make next Monday\u2019s scheduled protest in Dresden a test of whether Germans heed her call. She won re-election as leader of her Christian Democratic Union with 97.7 percent of the vote at a national party congress in December, but political scientists and some in her own camp assert that she is losing touch with popular sentiment.Outside Germany, whether dealing with the euro crisis or facing down President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over Ukraine, Ms. Merkel has proved patient and determined, sticking to austerity, for instance, despite clamor from markets and other European leaders for a change of direction.But dangers lurk even there. The crisis in Greece may prove more awkward this time around. Polls suggest that the winner of the snap election there on Jan. 25 could be the leftist Alexis Tsipras, who has pledged to ease social misery by renegotiating the terms of the country\u2019s financial rescue package. For Berlin, that means at best a long haggle over a costly new deal; at worst, a rift with the Central Bank and its chief, Mario Draghi, and liability for Greece\u2019s unpaid debts.In 2012, it was Mr. Draghi\u2019s pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d that crucially supported the euro. Now, Round 2 of the euro crisis looms with Mr. Draghi already at odds with Berlin over his widely predicted plan to purchase government bonds as the bank tries to revive Europe\u2019s economy.In Germany, any new money for Greece would be a hard sell to taxpayers \u201cwho still think that those \u2018lazy people\u2019 in Greece, Spain, Italy\u201d fritter away hard-earned cash from Northern Europe, said Gero Neugebauer, a political science professor at Berlin\u2019s Free University. The Draghi plan, though not specific to Greece, is unpopular for much the same reason.Michael Fuchs, a senior member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s party, warned on Wednesday that \u201cthe times when we had to rescue Greece are over.\u201dPotentially, the biggest challenge comes from the Alternative for Germany, a new populist party founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform. Its leaders now threaten to unite that message with rising anti-foreigner sentiment. The platform won them seats in three state legislatures in eastern Germany this fall.Ms. Merkel disdains the party in public, not even mentioning it in a long speech to her party congress. But last weekend, a former minister in her cabinet broke ranks. Ms. Merkel may be hugely popular now, Hans-Peter Friedrich, the former minister, told the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, but she has made a \u201cdisastrous mistake\u201d in shifting her party left, leaving a vacuum on the right that he warned could spell \u201cmortal danger\u201d for established conservatives.This criticism reeked for some of sour grapes. Mr. Friedrich, while still a senior member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, was ousted as agriculture minister last February over a complex possible breach of confidence that left him smarting.But it went to the heart of a long-simmering question about whether Ms. Merkel, famous for her tactical skills but accused by critics of lacking strategic vision, would remain popular if times turned worse in what is Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy.\u201cTurning a blind eye and staying silent is not working,\u201d wrote the influential center-right Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel after Mr. Friedrich\u2019s outburst. \u201cAngela Merkel owes her party \u2014 and the public \u2014 a few answers.\u201dMr. Friedrich\u2019s warnings contain \u201cmuch more than a score to settle with Angela Merkel,\u201d said Werner J. Patzelt, a political science professor at the Technical University in Dresden.Watching the anti-immigrant demonstrations from close up, Mr. Patzelt sees a danger that Germany\u2019s political leaders \u2014 who, like Ms. Merkel, support asylum for war refugees and luring immigrants needed for Germany\u2019s work force \u2014 are losing touch with ordinary people.Almost 50 percent of voters in Saxony did not participate in its Aug. 31 state elections, he noted. \u201cA large share is really people who have grown apart from the political system,\u201d he said. The establishment may have \u201cclear rules about what one can say, or not,\u201d Mr. Patzelt said. \u201cBut what the people really think is in large part something else.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s party congress delivered little on security, immigration or refugees, said Karl-Rudolf Korte, a professor at Duisburg-Essen University. On these issues, he told Deutschlandfunk radio, the Alternative for Germany \u201cis often the voice of the silent majority.\u201dMr. Friedrich openly courted anti-foreigner sentiment, criticizing particularly the decision to grant dual citizenship to children born here of foreign parents \u2014 a policy pushed on Ms. Merkel by the center-left Social Democrats in her \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government.\u201cThis easy attitude to citizenship is wrong, coming precisely when people are questioning their cultural identity, their home and togetherness,\u201d he told Der Spiegel. \u201cGermany is not just any old piece of land, settled more or less by chance by all kinds of people from all kinds of cultures.\u201dMs. Merkel countered in her New Year\u2019s remarks by extolling the virtues of \u201csticking together\u201d in tough times. Proof that this works, she said, is Germany\u2019s soccer squad, which won the World Cup in 2014 while featuring several players of foreign origin.But Alexander Gauland, a leader of the Alternative for Germany, and so far the only German politician of some note to have attended a Dresden rally, immediately signaled that she had a fight on her hands.By urging Germans to boycott the Dresden marches, he said, \u201cshe is condemning from on high people she doesn\u2019t know at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since then he has helped to run an investment fund that specializes in community banks.The position requires Senate confirmation, a difficult prospect for any Obama administration nominee now that Republicans control a majority of seats in that chamber. But Mr. Landon may be helped by the broad bipartisan support for putting a community banker on the Fed board. Draft legislation reserving a board seat for such a candidate passed the House last year, and has attracted wide backing in the Senate.Mr. Landon would become the first Fed governor with community banking experience since Elizabeth A. Duke left the board in 2013.\u201cHe gives a new perspective to the Federal Reserve Board that I believe is missing,\u201d said Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, which is among the groups lobbying for the appointment of a community banker. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have a boots-on-the-ground, Main Street, community banker perspective on the board right now. And we badly need that.\u201dAs a Fed governor, Mr. Landon would most likely focus on banking and regulatory issues, but he also would have a regular vote on monetary policy.His views on the Fed\u2019s role in managing the economy are not known, but two people with knowledge of the Obama administration\u2019s selection process said the White House had considered only nominees likely to support the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, in her campaign to stimulate the economy.Mr. Landon, a graduate of Iowa State University, worked for 18 years at Ernst & Young, auditing and advising community banks, before joining a Tennessee bank, First American, as chief financial officer in 1998. He took a job with Bank of Hawaii in 2000, becoming its president and chief executive four years later.Bank of Hawaii is larger than a typical community bank, which is sometimes defined as an institution with less than $10 billion in assets. Under Mr. Landon\u2019s leadership it grew by about a third, from $9.8 billion in assets to $12.7 billion, surviving the financial crisis without federal help and prospering afterward.Mr. Reppenhagen said Mr. Landon\u2019s \u201cthoughtful, unpretentious\u201d style was illustrated by a trip the two men took to the small town of Quincy, Calif., to visit a bank in which they were considering an investment.\u201cAl and the chief executive jumped in the car to get lunch,\u201d Mr. Reppenhagen said. \u201cAnd the guy ended up driving around the town, showing him what\u2019s going on, and then he drove him over to the community college and introduced him to his wife.\u201dThe partners decided to go ahead with the deal.But Mr. Landon now lives in Utah, and Mr. Reppenhagen said he hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Landon wear the shirts since he returned to the mainland.\u201cI think it may be a little cold for that,\u201d he said.Mr. Laubach is known for his work on economic models that predict, for example, the sustainable levels of interest rates and economic output. In a statement, the Fed cited his \u201cextensive contributions to the board\u2019s approach to forecasting and analyzing the U.S. economy.\u201dHe joined the Fed in 1997 after earning a doctorate in economics from Princeton University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Eyes on Berlin as E.C.B. Readies Bond-Buying Program", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBERLIN \u2014 In August 2012, during a visit to Canada, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany swept aside any doubts about her support for Mario Draghi and his controversial promise, weeks before, to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro.The pledge by Mr. Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, had set off a storm of criticism in Germany. Yet Ms. Merkel told reporters gathered in the Canadian Parliament building in Ottawa that Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks were \u201ccompletely in line\u201d with her own approach to the crisis.Her comments helped convince the financial markets that Mr. Draghi had the political support to back up his bold words with action, calming fears of a catastrophic breakup of the euro currency union.Two and a half years on, the crisis in Europe\u2019s single currency bloc has shifted from acute to chronic. And once again it has fallen to Mr. Draghi to come to the rescue.As Europe stumbles into 2015 dogged by weak growth, stubbornly high unemployment and the prospect of Japanese-style deflation, Mr. Draghi is on the verge of executing mass purchases of government bonds, a tactic known as quantitative easing, in hopes of jolting Europe\u2019s economy back to life. But this time around, it is unclear whether he can count on the same clear message of support from Berlin.Without this backing, the effectiveness of any stimulus program could be undermined. More fundamentally, a rift between Germany and the E.C.B. could herald a dangerous new phase for Europe in which the region\u2019s two most important shapers of policy are pushing against each other, rather than pulling together.In a rare four-page interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt on Friday, Mr. Draghi appeared to be going out of his way to reach out to the skeptics and avert such a clash.Germany\u2019s position on a bond-buying program is \u201carguably the single most important issue for the E.C.B. right now,\u201d said Marcel Fratzscher, head of the DIW economic institute in Berlin and a former senior official at the E.C.B. He added that for any bond-buying program to work, the support of Ms. Merkel and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, \u201cwill be absolutely vital.\u201dWhat has changed since 2012?For one thing, fears of a euro breakup have subsided. That has made it easier for German officials to push back against policies they disagree with.The fear in Berlin is that bond-buying will reduce the pressure on struggling members of the eurozone in southern Europe to reform. Some worry that by pumping new money into the system \u2014 the goal of bond-buying \u2014 the E.C.B. would be sowing the seeds of a future crisis.Further clouding the debate in Berlin is the rise of the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a new euroskeptic political party that did not exist back in 2012. After sweeping into three regional parliaments in eastern Germany in the second half of last year, the AfD will be trying to win its first seats in a western assembly when the city-state of Hamburg votes in mid-February.A bond-buying program, which the markets expect to be announced as soon as the E.C.B.\u2019s next policy meeting on Jan. 22, could play right into the AfD\u2019s hands.Uncertainty surrounding a Jan. 25 election in Greece, which could vault the left-wing Syriza party into power, has further complicated matters. Syriza has promised to cut Greece\u2019s debt load, prompting fears that the country will default on part of its debt, which could result in the E.C.B.\u2019s racking up severe losses on the mountain of Greek bonds that it holds. Should the E.C.B. announce a bond-buying program and, in turn, commit to buying more Greek sovereign bonds before the political outcome in Athens is clear, it would be impossible for the German government to remain silent, several officials said. \u201cThe Greek situation makes it much more difficult to announce\u201d a bond-buying program, said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London.The other big cloud hanging over the stimulus program is the risk of a legal challenge by Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court. In February 2013, the court expressed concerns that Mr. Draghi\u2019s promise to buy bonds if needed to defend the euro, part of his \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech, exceeded the E.C.B\u2019s mandate and violated a ban on funding governments.The German high court referred the case to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, whose adviser is expected to give a preliminary assessment on Jan. 14 before a final ruling in mid-2015. The decision could have big implications for how the E.C.B. structures a bond-buying program. \u201cThe consensus view in the market is that the E.C.J. won\u2019t find anything wrong with the bond-buying scheme, but there is a risk,\u201d said Elga Bartsch, chief European economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cBerlin is clearly worried about the implications of the E.C.J. ruling for the German Constitutional Court,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the E.C.B. is also taking it very seriously.\u201dRegardless of what the European court adviser says, the E.C.B. may feel the need to tread carefully, pending a final ruling. That increases the chances of a bond-buying program in which the credit risks tied to purchased bonds remain with national central banks, an idea that was floated last month by Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president. If the E.C.B. goes down this path, Ms. Merkel could feel more comfortable endorsing the stimulus program, regardless of the criticism that is sure to flow from the AfD and some of her conservative allies in Parliament. But will a bond-buying program designed to address German concerns satisfy the financial markets, which for months have been pricing in bold action from Mr. Draghi? Mr. Odendahl at the Center for European Reform fears it will not. \u201cIf you limit this along national lines, it would clearly be a disappointment, because it would show quite starkly that the E.C.B. is running up against its limits,\u201d he said. \u201cDraghi knows that the announcement itself will be the most important thing. I hope he is bold.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Stop Currency Manipulation", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 IF the new Congress can agree on anything this year, it may well be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal between the United States and 11 other countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Passions run high when it comes to trade deals these days, and the Obama administration is working hard to sell it to labor unions, which roundly oppose it. So far the pitch has been about what the deal, as written, will do to help the American economy \u2014 a pitch that hasn\u2019t won over many, on either side of the partisan divide. But there\u2019s one thing the administration can do that will both win over some opponents and address one of the biggest issues in global trade: add a chapter on currency manipulation.It is not unusual for countries to manage their exchange rate \u2014 the value of their currency relative to others \u2014 to make their exports cheap while making others\u2019 exports to them more expensive. This method has been used extensively by, among others, China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore \u2014 aside from China, all signatories to the partnership. The American dollar is a prime target for these currency managers. First, the dollar is the global trading system\u2019s premier reserve currency, meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors. And Americans are a highly acquisitive people \u2014 a nice way of saying we buy a lot of stuff. Consumer spending as a share of gross domestic product is about 70 percent here, 55 percent in Europe and 35 percent in China. We\u2019re steady customers for export-led economies. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, until these exporters start buying dollars to raise the value of the dollar relative to their own currencies, thus subsidizing their exports and taxing their imports. In the United States, the result is persistent trade deficits that have been a drag on growth and jobs \u2014 better-than-average manufacturing jobs \u2014 for decades.The challenge is in the details. Countries buy foreign currencies for various reasons, not just to gain a trade advantage, and they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be held to account for doing so. Moreover, opponents of such a chapter argue that it would cover the actions of our own central bank, the Federal Reserve, and open it to charges that it also manipulates exchange rates. (When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate, or engages in \u201cquantitative easing\u201d to lower longer-term rates, one clear consequence is to lower the value of the dollar.) But that argument doesn\u2019t quite hold. It\u2019s a matter of intent, and there is a clear test: whether the central bank is engaging in domestic demand management or currency management, and the simplest way to tell is to observe whether the bank is buying foreign currencies. The People\u2019s Bank of China does a great deal of that. Our Fed does almost none.It\u2019s important to recognize that deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership are not necessarily about \u201cfree trade.\u201d They are instead a set of rules; some, like lowering tariffs, lead to freer trade, while others, like expanding patent protections, are more protectionist. Rules governing currency tactics certainly fit the framework.Some purchasing of foreign currency should be fine under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some developing economies collect dollars to cover their external debts in case of financial crises and large outflows of private capital. With this in mind, Mr. Bergsten suggests that holding enough foreign currency to cover a year\u2019s worth of external liabilities might be a sound benchmark; anything more would be questionable. Speaking of China, even though it\u2019s not part of the partnership talks, rules like these, especially reciprocity, should be applied to it as well. Not to do so would put the signatory countries at a distinct disadvantage to a trade behemoth with a history of undervaluing its currency to maintain trade surpluses. As a White House economist in the first few years of the Obama administration, I learned that many of my colleagues shared my concerns about currency management. But all administrations believe the only way to do something about it is through quiet diplomacy. They believe that writing down rules in a trade agreement is too risky, with the potential to scuttle the whole deal. Diplomacy hasn\u2019t worked. A more direct approach is needed. If the trade deal\u2019s supporters want an agreement worthy of broad support, this is a chance they can\u2019t afford to miss.An earlier version of the web summary for this Op-Ed contained an error.

{"Headline": "What a Stronger Dollar Means for the Economy", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrency SwingsIt just might be time to book that vacation in Paris you\u2019ve been thinking about.That is one practical conclusion to draw from a remarkable set of shifts in global currencies that started in the second half of last year and has continued in the early trading days of 2015. The seemingly inexorable rise of the dollar versus the euro and most other currencies has broad implications for the global economy this year and beyond.But the consequences are quite a bit more varied, some straight from Econ 101 and others unique to the current circumstances.If you are United States-based Boeing competing with European Airbus to sell jumbo jets around the world, or a California winemaker trying to persuade global buyers your product is better than its French and Italian counterparts, your competitiveness has fallen. Firms that must pay workers and buy raw materials in now-depreciated currencies like the euro and yen are effectively getting cost savings even without having to cut pay or renegotiate with suppliers.That said, because the currency appreciation has its roots in an improving domestic economy, American manufacturers are hardly panicking. We\u2019ve heard little complaining \u2014 so far at least \u2014 from business interests complaining that other countries are engaging in currency wars.\u201cThe dollar is strengthening in many ways for the right reasons,\u201d said Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, \u201cbecause we\u2019re one of the brighter spots in the world. That will present a challenge in terms of growing exports, but at least to the extent we\u2019re strengthening it\u2019s because the U.S. economy is getting better.\u201dThat said, if the appreciation goes much further, don\u2019t be surprised if United States exporters start to pressure the government to apply diplomatic pressure to reverse the slide.But oil prices are almost always quoted in dollars, so the dollar appreciation exaggerates somewhat the extent to which oil prices are falling for most people around the world.In Europe, notably, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil has fallen 53 percent when measured in dollars since June 30, but only 46 percent when measured in euros. Cheaper oil will be good for consumers everywhere, but the strong dollar means the shift is sharpest for Americans.A more expensive dollar will mean cheaper imported goods for Americans, while making imports more expensive for those overseas. While major central banks don\u2019t normally make currency values the explicit focus of their policies, they are supposed to account for whatever impact their fluctuations have on inflation.In that sense, for the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, the falling currency values could have a welcome effect of helping prices rise a bit faster, at least temporarily. For the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, it could mean even lower inflation and more latitude, should its leaders choose, to wait longer before raising interest rates.This is really a variation of the point above about a strong dollar creating challenges for exporters, in the sense that a Japanese tourist who visits California and spends $5,000 has pretty much the same impact, in terms of trade and balance of payments effects, as our California winemaker shipping $5,000 worth of wine to Tokyo.But as people make their summer plans, the fact that, for example, European destinations are 12.5 percent cheaper than they were six months ago in dollar terms could both make locations abroad more attractive to Americans and United States travel less attractive to would-be foreign visitors.The effect shouldn\u2019t be enormous, argues David Huether, the senior vice president for research at the U.S. Travel Association; their analysis suggests that a 10 percent rise in the dollar should translate into only a 0.2 percent drop in the number of visitors from abroad.\u201cThe value of the dollar will have some impact, but I think travel will be less impacted than other goods and services, where a piece of steel is a piece of steel,\u201d said Mr. Huether, arguing that the United States\u2019 distinct offerings are attractive enough that travelers will pay a higher price to visit.Barring a reversal in currencies, 2015 is shaping up to be a year of testing just how high a price they\u2019re willing to pay.Advertisement"}

So when a self-taught cook manages to pull it off using only a hot plate, a plug-in stew pot and a panini press, the results can seem like feats of culinary magic. Part of the wizardry here has to do with ambience. Wine bars can be intimidating, especially for novices. But the married co-owners, Andrew Hotis and Michelle Chadwick-Hotis, who work the space together every evening, have an easy warmth and an appealing, plain-spoken way of discussing terroir and varietals that immediately dispel any shyness. (Ms. Chadwick-Hotis described a Spanish red to me as \u201cgravelly, you know? It has a little bite to it.\u201d) Though each spent years working in upscale bars and eateries around the country \u2014 most recently in Manhattan \u2014 they comport themselves here, in their first shared venture, as if entertaining friends in their own living room. The space itself is inviting in a deeply personal way. Before opening the restaurant, the couple spent 10 months refurbishing the 1920s-era, 350-square-foot room (once a goldsmith shop, and before that a headquarters for a local election campaign), painstakingly restoring the pressed-tin ceilings and wide-plank floors themselves. Their labors somehow imbue the place with a cherished, intimate feel; so do the quirky personal items they have used to decorate.

Old clothbound copies of Shakespeare plays are piled here and there, too \u2014 and are used to tuck bar bills into.The most startling sorcery at August, however, happens in the tight alcove \u2014 right next to the wine rack and shelves of Reidel goblets \u2014 where Mr. Hotis cooks. Building on what he learned working in esteemed spots like Lelabar in the West Village, he has crafted a small, seasonally changing menu based not just on high-quality ingredients, but on what he can prepare at a station roughly the size of a speaker\u2019s lectern. A miracle of space economy, his niche evokes the galley of a sailboat \u2014 incorporating hidden mini-fridges and artfully stacked cutting boards and utensils, and a meat slicer that pulls out on a sliding shelf so Mr. Hotis can compose charcuterie plates.\u201cBelieve it or not, I actually prefer working in this sort of limited space,\u201d Mr. Hotis told me after several visits. \u201cIt forces me to be more creative, to make more intelligent choices about what to cook.\u201d His one-page menu is succinct, but it always has a few of what he calls \u201ccurveballs\u201d in it: unusual ingredients that marry in surprisingly nuanced ways. Among the excellent dishes I tried were a \u201cwinter stew\u201d (actually more of a richly flavored soup) bobbing with coins of rabbit sausage and heirloom Royal Corona beans; a thick-crusted panini sandwich layered with meaty Spanish sardines, a shallot lemon zest gremolata, and a smear of Sriracha mayo; and a hearty salad of slow-cooked wheat berries and kale, studded with wine-soaked raisins and maple-glazed walnuts (Mr. Hotis prepares the raisins and walnuts in house, as he does almost all his condiments.) The one drawback to working on such a small scale is that menu items sometimes run out; it was with great wistfulness that friends and I watched one night as the last plate of delicate smoked-salmon rillette was delivered to the couple seated next to us. But we were placated by the arrival of two splendid desserts \u2014 a silken goat-milk panna cotta and a luxuriant salted caramel pudding (the first made by Mr. Hotis, the second by Ms. Chadwick-Hotis). Also, by the realization that we now had a perfect excuse to return.\u25cfAugust: Upscale Bar and Eatery3 Edwards StreetNew Haven203-745-4531Very GoodAdvertisement"}

I didn\u2019t think so. At some point, you have to stop trying to find every new tool for and shortcut to bargains as they appear and just wait to see which ones stick. By now, you surely know some basics: You probably use meta-search sites to compare airfare and hotel prices; you\u2019ve either tried or consciously avoided \u201csharing economy\u201d services like Uber; you know that most domestic car rental reservations can be canceled with no penalty should you find a better rate even on the day of the trip.So instead of offering wacky tricks, here are eight ways to take strategies you already know and do them better \u2014 with, O.K., a few new appealing tools thrown in.If even cars are a bit much for you, how about renting someone\u2019s bike? Spinlister.com started in 2012 and has since spread across the world; last December it added skis and this past summer expanded to surfboards and standup paddle boards.Nothing on Airbnb says you can negotiate a better price when you book rooms or apartments or houses or yurts, but nothing says you can\u2019t, either. Write the host a note that goes something like this: \u201cYour place looks great but it\u2019s a bit outside my price range. Would you consider $60 a night?\u201d (It\u2019s not as likely to work if the property is managed by a third party rather than directly by the owner.) You\u2019ve also probably noticed Airbnb\u2019s service fees of 6 to 12 percent when they ambush you before you finalize your reservation. A new start-up with a cute name, hovelstay.com, charges a lower 3 percent service fee and caps its (pre-fee) prices at $99 a night \u2014 no more browsing jealously through those gorgeous, unaffordable Airbnb digs.

But a stopover in Kiev? That\u2019s new. Ukrainian International Airlines began flying out of New York in late April \u2014 tragically bad timing. Less than three months later, a Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down near the Ukraine-Russia border amid unrest in the southern and eastern parts of the country itself (far from Kiev). But the airline staged a comeback with almost absurd promotional rates from New York (Dubai for $453?), and although tickets are going fast, as of this writing you can still get from New York to Istanbul or Athens for $479 in February, for example; to Bangkok for $953 in May. All have very reasonable layovers. I couldn\u2019t resist, and booked a flight from New York to Tbilisi, Georgia, and back from Yerevan, Armenia, for $493, with two checked bags (great!) and Ukrainian airplane food (hmmmm).Probably the most common question I get is where to sleep cheaply in New York. I used to hem and haw and mumble something about Priceline bidding, but now I have a new answer: Stay in Long Island \u00adCity, Queens, just across the East River. When I checked what a week\u2019s stay would cost in March at hotels one or two subway stops from Midtown, I was shocked to find that 18 of 20 hotels were $151 a night or less. (With taxes it\u2019s $180 or less.) Do you know what Manhattan hotels cost? For that matter, do you know what Manhattan rents are? Even some city residents could save cash (and gain housekeeping service) just by moving in. The same idea can apply to other cities that have secondary clusters outside the main business district but near public transportation. Use Hipmunk\u2019s great maps to scout out the city you\u2019re visiting.Budget travelers are quick to assume their credit card will make the collision damage waiver sold by car rental companies unnecessary, and that their health insurance will cover them fully while abroad. Those can be costly assumptions; credit cards normally don\u2019t cover liability and may not cover collision in all countries, for example. Between now and your next trip, make a cup of coffee, take a deep breath, and plow through the small print of your favorite credit card\u2019s benefit package and your health insurance\u2019s international coverage. Everything\u2019s online, of course, so \u201csmall print\u201d is just a figure of speech.

For much of that period, each generation got about two more years of education than their parents. Accumulated over several generations, this led the average number of years the average American invested in education to roughly double.The macroeconomic consequences are profound. Economists believe that there are really only three ways to raise living standards over the long run: to invest more in education, to invest more in machines or to innovate so that the same people and machines can more effectively be combined to produce more output.Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal is an effort to revive education as one of the drivers of economic growth. If he succeeds in persuading more of the next generation to continue beyond high school, and to invest in community college and possibly beyond, there\u2019s a strong chance the rate of economic growth will be bolstered for decades to come. And relative to other ways of strengthening growth, investment in community college is most likely to ensure that the middle class shares in the benefits of it.It remains to be seen whether Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal will come to fruition, and whether community colleges can do their part. But in the long run of history, something like Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal \u2014 let\u2019s call it the \u201ccollege movement\u201d \u2014 is the obvious next step beyond the high school movement.

During a 20-minute harangue, she ordered the plane to return to the gate to kick out Park Chang-jin, the head of the cabin crew, they said.\u201cThe unprecedented turnaround of the plane undermined the credibility of Korean Air and the national image of South Korea,\u201d the prosecutors said in a statement.The \u201cnut rage\u201d incident, as Ms. Cho\u2019s case became known, drew extensive attention in South Korea, where many people considered it to be far more than a tantrum by the spoiled daughter of a tycoon. They believed that the way Korean Air and the Transport Ministry had handled the episode confirmed some of their worst misgivings about the chaebol and their relations with government regulators.Since the Korean War, a handful of chaebol families have built conglomerates like Samsung and Hyundai that dominate the South Korean economy. But they have also developed a reputation for running their corporate empires like dictators and for maintaining collusive ties with regulators. Indicted along with Ms. Cho on Wednesday was a Korean Air executive, identified by the family name Yeo, who was accused of coercing airline officials to delete an email on what had happened on Dec. 5 and lie to government investigators to protect Ms. Cho. Prosecutors also indicted a Transport Ministry official on charges of illegally briefing Mr. Yeo on the confidential details of the official inquiry.Mr. Park, the attendant who was kicked off the plane, said in news interviews that Ms. Cho had made him and a junior flight attendant who had served the nuts apologize on their knees. He also said that Korean Air officials had pressured him to give Transport Ministry investigators a less incriminating version of what had happened.The ministry later said that its inquiry had been faulty and unfair, and it disciplined eight investigators. Ms. Cho, for her part, has repeatedly apologized for her actions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Stress Test for Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMario Draghi indulged the photographers and their rapid-fire shutters for a few moments, making his first appearance for the news media in the European Central Bank\u2019s ostentatious new high-rise headquarters in Frankfurt.Then he shooed the cameras away. He had an important message to deliver.Emphasizing every word, Mr. Draghi said that the bank\u2019s governing council had just agreed to prepare \u201cfor further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner.\u201dBut on this day, after months of Mr. Draghi\u2019s saying the equivalent of \u201cstay tuned,\u201d his statement of resolve failed to work the old magic.European stock markets sagged even as he spoke. The reaction by investors, whose money and faith will be crucial to any true economic recovery, raised an ominous question: Is the man who is arguably the most powerful official in Europe really powerful enough to pull the eurozone out of its doldrums?Mr. Draghi\u2019s quandary is that the actions that might save the eurozone also threaten to divide it.Mr. Draghi continues to send signals that a bond-buying program is in the works. In an interview published on Friday, he warned of the danger that low inflation could cause people to delay purchases, in the expectation that prices will fall further. If so, that could be the beginning of a pernicious decline of expectations that would undermine consumer spending and business investment.\u201cHistory shows that falling prices can be as damaging to the prosperity and stability of our countries as high inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in an interview with Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper. \u201cThe purchase of government bonds is one of the tools in our toolbox.\u201d Yet even as Mr. Draghi tiptoes toward a bond-buying program, which could be unveiled as early as the central bank\u2019s policy meeting on Jan. 22, he faces challenges from inside and outside the walls of his new 45-story headquarters, which had a price tag of 1.2 billion euros, or $1.5 billion.But whatever differences he must bridge, many economists say Mr. Draghi is running out of time to deliver the decisive action needed to prevent low inflation from becoming a chronic condition. While low prices benefit consumers in the short term, extended low inflation, which could worsen into the widespread decline in prices known as deflation, imposes a heavy burden on borrowers and makes it hard for companies to be profitable, encouraging them to cut wages or lay off workers.By some measures, Mr. Draghi, a 67-year-old native of Rome who earned a doctorate in economics from M.I.T., is at the peak of his powers. Wielding the moral authority he acquired after calming the markets and pulling the eurozone from the brink with his \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d promise, he has overseen an expansion of the European Central Bank\u2019s jurisdiction.Not only does the central bank manage a currency used by 338 million people, in November it also began regulating eurozone banks, which together constitute the world\u2019s largest banking system.Given his purview, Mr. Draghi arguably has as much or more power in Europe than national political leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. And because he is appointed by European political leaders, he does not need to win re-election. (Mr. Draghi, who rarely gives interviews, declined to comment for this article.) Yet in its core task \u2014 to keep inflation below, but close to, 2 percent \u2014 the central bank has fallen short. The last time the eurozone\u2019s annual rate of inflation was 2 percent was in January 2013. As of November 2014, the rate was only 0.3 percent, already low enough to have a pernicious effect on growth.Under Mr. Draghi and his riven council, the central bank has also presided over a steep decline in the size of its balance sheet, the key measure of how much money it has been able to pump into the economy. That number has shrunk to about \u20ac2 trillion from almost \u20ac3 trillion early in 2012, as commercial banks repaid loans from the central bank.The Federal Reserve, by contrast, which had a balance sheet about the same size as the European Central Bank\u2019s in early 2012, has since increased its holdings to $4 trillion from $3 trillion.If Mr. Draghi feels wounded by such criticism, he does not show it. In public appearances, he exudes confidence. And he is not shy about dismissing his critics.Raising his voice and sweeping his arm dismissively during an appearance in Parliament late last year, Mr. Draghi said the central bank had a duty to protect the money it had lent Irish banks after the financial markets cut them off. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should worry about that?\u201d Mr. Draghi asked, with an irritation unusual for an otherwise supremely composed central banker. Any fissures within the central bank\u2019s governing council, say those who have observed the dynamic, might be partly a result of Mr. Draghi\u2019s approach to management and diplomacy \u2014 and impatience with lesser intellects.There has been criticism \u2014 mostly from people who did not want to be identified for fear of offending him \u2014 that Mr. Draghi is aloof, especially when compared with his voluble predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet. Mr. Draghi is known to confide in a small number of trusted colleagues, such as Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, one of the six members of the executive board, who has a background in economics and public finance that is similar to Mr. Draghi\u2019s.Others can feel left out of the loop.Mr. Draghi\u2019s pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d for example, was an impromptu addition to a scheduled speech at a banking conference in London, according to a published transcript of an interview with Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary of the United States.With that comment, as he later made clearer, Mr. Draghi was alluding to the central bank\u2019s being ready to intervene in the bond markets, if necessary, to reduce the borrowing costs of Italy and some other eurozone countries, which had spiked to dangerous heights.It was evidently a promise made without consulting the governing council. Only later did the council formalize the promise with a program \u2014 as yet unused \u2014 to buy the bonds of troubled countries.Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany\u2019s central bank, the Bundesbank, and a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, has argued against more aggressive monetary stimulus and been a thorn in Mr. Draghi\u2019s side. On Dec. 17, for example, Mr. Weidmann told reporters in Frankfurt that he would regard quantitative easing \u201cwith skepticism,\u201d citing \u201cthe rather modest and uncertain impact of a broad Q.E. package, together with the risks and side effects it could bring and the unclear need for it at present.\u201dHe also said he considered the fear of deflation overblown. \u201cAn inflation rate below zero for a period of a few months does not yet constitute deflation in my opinion,\u201d said Mr. Weidmann, who declined several requests for an interview.But after reports last fall of a growing schism on the governing council, Mr. Weidmann and Mr. Draghi have made a show of getting along. People close to them emphasized recently that they speak often, even if they don\u2019t always see eye to eye.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly normal to disagree about things,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in November, noting that central bankers in the United States, Britain and Japan also have their differences. \u201cIt happens everywhere.\u201dAll central banks face internal dissension, but Europe\u2019s is unique in that its members are separate countries. The eurozone is a currency union with a centralized monetary policy, but the member countries remain largely in control of their own budgets and regulatory policies.The leaders of France and Italy, the second- and third-largest eurozone economies after Germany, seem unable to overcome resistance from trade unions and other interest groups over changes that promise to help improve long-term growth. Even Germany, the region\u2019s economic anchor, has lost momentum and barely escaped falling into recession in the third quarter of 2014, the most recent to be reported.Without a more aggressive monetary policy, Ms. Reichlin and a growing chorus of economists say, Europe has little chance of economic revival anytime soon.But in Germany, conservative opposition to large-scale asset purchases similar to those conducted by the Fed and the Bank of England borders on the hysterical.German opposition to bond-buying reflects broader discontent with the way the common currency has, in the eyes of many Europeans, failed to deliver the prosperity it promised. In its most extreme form, this discontent manifests itself as a protest toward the whole idea of a united Europe, nourishing right-wing parties like the National Front, in France, and the Alternative for Germany.If Mr. Draghi is fortunate, the eurozone economy will start to recover without a big central-bank intervention, and inflation will rise toward the 2 percent target. The plunge in world oil prices will provide some stimulus, but because fuel is usually priced in dollars, it is being partly offset by a weaker euro.But the costs of delay are mounting. And now, even if the central bank finally does begin full-bore quantitative easing, there is no certainty that it will be enough to rescue the eurozone\u2019s creaky, highly regulated economy.\u201cQ.E. in the euro area is much less effective,\u201d Mr. Asmussen said. That, he said, is because bond-buying is most effective in economies like that of the United States, where the business world gets most of its financing through capital markets. European companies tend to get their money from banks.\u201cI think it could be a good thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would warn against expecting the effects to be as large.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Binyamin Appelbaum from Washington.

{"Headline": "Uber Tries to Mend Fences With Europe", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravis Kalanick, chief executive of the ride-hailing service Uber, wants to play nice with Europe.That was the message Mr. Kalanick delivered at a technology conference on Sunday in Munich, saying he wanted to work with politicians to find ways for Uber to operate legally across the European Union.The renewed effort by Uber, which allows drivers to connect with potential passengers through a smartphone application, comes after many European cities have banned some of the company\u2019s services after taxi associations and politicians said that Uber did not comply with local laws.\u201cWe want to make 2015 the year when we create new partnerships with European cities,\u201d said Mr. Kalanick, who added that he expected to spend more time in Europe this year. \u201cIf we can make those partnerships happen, we could create 50,000 new jobs.\u201dHis words are aimed at convincing European policy makers that the company represents an opportunity \u2014 and not a threat \u2014 to cities\u2019 economies.Some politicians across the 28-member European Union, who have accused the company of failing to comply with local transportation rules, have yet to be convinced. In Spain, for instance, Uber recently shut down its operations after a local judge said that the company did not satisfy the country\u2019s taxi rules and potentially amounted to unfair competition for taxi drivers.On Sunday, Mr. Kalanick rebutted these claims, adding that current transportation rules were devised to protect existing taxi associations that often hold quasi-monopolies in some cities. \u201cWhy do these rules exist?\u201d Mr. Kalanick said. \u201cThey exist because the taxi industry is trying to protect itself through regulatory capture.\u201dWhile Mr. Kalanick was trying to use his speech to improve the company\u2019s somewhat difficult relationship with Europe\u2019s policy makers, some politicians are likely to remain concerned about the company\u2019s push across the region.That includes in Germany \u2014 home to Europe\u2019s largest automotive industry. Mr. Kalanick told the audience Sunday that Uber wanted to take tens of thousands of cars off Europe\u2019s roads this year, as people increasingly turn to his company for transportation and decide not to buy their own cars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Movies and Markets Clash", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 At the end of November, a group of young Serbian artists and activists burst into an abandoned cinema in Belgrade called Zvezda. The theater was to be demolished, and the \u201cMovement for the Occupation of Cinemas\u201d was determined to save it. Over six weeks later, they\u2019re still there, putting on films and attracting worldwide attention for their stand \u2014 but also raising questions about what, exactly, cinema means in today\u2019s society.Zvezda, whose name means \u201cStar\u201d in Serbian, isn\u2019t just any theater. Before it was closed, it was one of the crowning symbols of the propulsive and world-famous Yugoslav film industry. For a time, in the 1960s, Serbian films, led by the so-called Black Wave movement, were some of the most provocative in the world, winning global acclaim for their use of experimental techniques to critique socialist society. International stars flocked to the country, including Richard Burton, Sophia Loren and Orson Welles. The former Yugoslavia was a country in love with the movies, whatever the genre. Josip Broz Tito himself reportedly watched almost 9,000 movies between 1949 and his death in 1980, about 285 a year (he was partial to American Westerns, especially ones starring John Wayne).But while Serbians still go to the movies, the notion of a vibrant national film culture is in the distant past, brought low by the post-socialist, post-Balkan war wave of privatization and globalization of the 2000s. State-owned companies were privatized pell-mell; a Serbian businessman bought 14 cinemas of the once-famous Belgrade Film chain, worth an estimated $80 million, for about $10 million. Most of these and other theaters were converted into more profitable operations like supermarkets, restaurants and nightclubs. Not only did the privatization process transform old-style cinemas into modern multiplexes, but the whole logic of the profit-oriented ideology turned culture into just another commodity.When it looked as if the same fate was about to befall the old Zvezda, the artists and activists got moving. Along with screening classic and new movies \u2014 including a short film made in support of the occupation by the French director Michel Gondry \u2014 the occupiers have used the theater to highlight the painful consequences for culture and civic society of an economy built on austerity and profit above all else.In December they hosted Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist Greek political party Syriza (and perhaps Greece\u2019s next prime minister). \u201cIt is important to support movements that are fighting against privatization, movements that stand against the attack of neoliberalism,\u201d Mr. Tsipras declared.Then an interesting incident happened. The movement is divided into two factions, which identify as \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201capolitical.\u201d An activist from the latter asked Mr. Tsipras if he was a \u201cfilm worker\u201d \u2014 and, if not, why he was there.Mr. Tsipras answered, \u201cI\u2019m not a film worker, but I am here because I am against privatizations and to support you\u201d \u2014 an obvious answer that seemed to be lost on the apoliticals.And here lies the great danger for the occupiers, and anyone else who wants to take a similar stand. There is no barrier between politics and culture, especially in a place like Serbia, where the ideology of political and economic transition, and the inevitable wave of privatization that came with it, has meant the wholesale destruction of old cinemas. To take a stand in defense of culture is in itself to take a political stand (and to nevertheless declare oneself \u201capolitical\u201d is itself a political act).The people inside Zvezda now face the same question faced by other recent movements, like Occupy Wall Street: What next? It is not enough just to occupy a space and believe, narcissistically, that the day after will never come.Privatization continues apace in Serbia \u2014 according to some counts, 500 formerly state-held companies will be privatized in 2015. Last year a new, market-friendly labor law was put in place, as was a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. In this moment, these activists must realize that the occupation of a cinema is not only a \u201ccultural\u201d action, and it is not something exclusively reserved for \u201cfilm workers.\u201d It is much more.To be fair, many people inside Zvezda understand this. I asked Ivan Velisavljevic, one of the members of the Movement for the Occupation of Cinemas, what would come next for the theater. He said that while everyone agreed on the idea that it had to be treated as a common, public space outside the commercial mainstream, there was deep debate over what that would look like. \u201cIn terms of management, some of the people involved fantasize about worker-owned cooperatives, some about volunteer collectives, and some about a small group of hipsters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf things around Zvezda don\u2019t fall apart soon, this decision about the type of management will have a crucial consequence: It will be a statement and a clear political act.\u201dIn other words, while we must accept that there is no going back to the days of state-sponsored and state-owned theaters, we must also recognize that the market system is not the only alternative. Self-management is not something that belongs to the museum of failed Yugoslav ideas; if it is reinvented with the awareness that even culture \u2014 together with natural resources, infrastructure or education \u2014 belongs to the commons, it can maybe be a way through the desert of capitalism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Surprise Isn\u2019t That an Extreme Party Won in Greece. It\u2019s That It Took This Long.", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byView From AbroadWhen I was last in Greece, for a reporting trip in May 2012, Syriza, a political party whose name is an acronym for \u201ccoalition of the radical left,\u201d had recorded shockingly strong results in a recent election. The centrist, mainstream sources I was meeting with \u2014 such as bankers and ex-politicians \u2014 were nervous about what Syriza supporters, whom they viewed as wackos, meant for their country.Greek stock and bond markets sold off sharply, but elsewhere in Europe markets were mostly up. The euro currency was actually up a bit against the dollar Monday. In newspapers across Europe, there is some tut-tutting about the leftists who will now run Greece, but hardly what you would call panic.In short, global markets and many European leaders are viewing Mr. Tsipras as less a firebrand radical and more a pragmatic dealmaker who just happens to have a starting negotiating position that is different from their own.That\u2019s important because it means the country could theoretically repudiate its debts while maintaining its current levels of taxing and spending. In practice, the panic that would come with debt repudiation, and a likely exit from the eurozone, would introduce a new source of economic downdraft for Greece that may make that action less realistic.Besides, Mr. Tsipras has said repeatedly he wants Greece to remain part of the European Union. He wants to keep its deep connections with the rest of the continent and continue to use the euro currency. To do that, any restructuring of debt or reworking of austerity policies will have to happen through negotiations with international creditors, not through unilateral action by the Greek government.That will constrain his ability to successfully play a game of chicken with the troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Expect a period of tricky brinkmanship as they try to hammer out a deal that gives Greece some relief without making other European governments feel the country is backtracking excessively from sustainable finances and policies.But the thing that\u2019s most striking about the elevation of this radical party to the helm of Greece\u2019s government is that its core goals don\u2019t seem very radical at all.There are presumably many, many opinions that members of the Syriza coalition hold that most people in the United States or Western Europe would find objectionable or even scary; the group includes Maoists and Trotskyites and anarchists (Oh my!). And Mr. Tsipras will surely face challenges from within his own fractious coalition in keeping the core goals.Perhaps more scary than anything Mr. Tsipras is proposing was the success of Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party with neo-Nazi leanings. It came in third in the Greek elections.For years, the mismanagement of Europe\u2019s economy by its leaders in Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin has fueled discontent. The rise of parties that reject the received wisdom in these European centers is partly because they are untainted by the decisions that got Greece into this morass.In other words, the real surprise is not that Greek leftists have been elected. The surprise is that it took this long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Reboots Chevrolet Volt as Automakers Push Electric Cars", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by14 PhotosBut that\u2019s not stopping automakers from continuing to make huge investments in green vehicles, introducing one model after another.And the Korean carmaker Hyundai said on Monday that it would produce a plug-in hybrid version of its midsize Sonata sedan.They joined a host of other automakers that have rolled out electric cars of their own in recent years. Ford has introduced an electrified version of its Ford Fusion, and brands like Fiat and BMW now produce small volumes of electric cars. In all, more than 20 models, either all-electric or the kind with gas backup engines, called plug-in hybrids, have hit the market.The announcements by G.M. and Hyundai are the latest attempt to find the winning formula for electric cars as automakers feel increasing pressure to meet strict federal regulations for emissions and fuel economy.Yet it is proving to be a tough sell. With fuel prices dipping to historical lows and conventional gasoline engines becoming more efficient, electrified cars are languishing in showrooms.Sales of new cars and trucks in the United States increased about 6 percent in 2014, to 16.5 million vehicles, the industry\u2019s best overall performance since 2007.But electrified models remain a tiny niche. Last year, automakers sold about 120,000 all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid ones like the Volt \u2014 a 20 percent increase over the previous year, but still a fraction of the overall industry volume.And that figure is not nearly what automakers will need if they are to meet the required corporate average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Automakers currently average about 25 miles a gallon. The standard is based on an automaker\u2019s fleet average, not on the cars it actually sells.They face even tougher mandates in California, which requires that 15.4 percent of the vehicles automakers sell be powered by alternative technology by 2025. Because of this, some green vehicles, like the all-electric Kia Soul, are, at least for now, sold only in California.\u201cLike it or not, they have to do it to meet the government regulations,\u201d said Joseph Phillippi, president of the consulting firm Auto Trends. \u201cThey really have no other choice.\u201dBut for electric cars to earn widespread adoption, they will have to increase their driving range. G.M.\u2019s all-electric Bolt tries to solve that by getting 200 miles on a single battery charge.G.M. executives declined to say when the car would come to market, but pledged to bring it out at a price of about $30,000, with the inclusion of an existing $7,500 federal tax credit.\u201cWe are pretty convinced that this is the right vehicle for the market at the right time,\u201d said Alan Batey, G.M.\u2019s chief of North American sales and marketing. \u201cWe would not be talking about the price and battery range if we weren\u2019t able to make it happen.\u201dUntil the Bolt comes out, G.M. will pin its hopes on the new production-ready version of its Volt.The Volt has sold sparsely since G.M. introduced it to great fanfare in 2010.The car, like all plug-in hybrids, runs primarily on electric power before switching to a small gasoline engine that recharges its battery. But while the first Volt could travel about 35 miles solely on battery power, the new model has a 50-mile electric range.\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient, more responsive, more refined, and has a greater range,\u201d said Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe Volt confirms our leadership position, and now we intend to take it further with the Chevrolet Bolt.\u201dSergio Marchionne, the chief executive of newly merged Fiat Chrysler, which has lagged the competition in the industry\u2019s push to electrify, said the proliferation of electric and plug-in vehicles was \u201cinevitable\u201d because of rules mandating lower carbon emissions and greater fuel economy.But whether consumers are willing to pay high prices for green vehicles is still a question hovering over the industry.Tesla, whose high-end Model S retails for $70,000 and higher, has proved to be the outlier, winning a devoted following.The strong United States automobile market has increased profits for most automakers and allowed them to invest heavily in alternative-fuel technology. But Mr. Marchionne bemoaned the cost to companies of developing electric vehicles on their own, and suggested that manufacturers should collaborate on projects to defray expenses.He was also outspoken on the need for industry executives to seek a slowdown in fuel-economy rules when the regulations are reviewed in 2017.\u201cI think there is a very strong argument that we should slow down the rate of the regulations,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said. \u201cAnd there is an opportunity in the 2017 review period to do that.\u201dUntil the regulatory environment changes, automakers will continue to press ahead on electrification.For G.M., the introductions of the revamped Volt and the Bolt concept car provide an opportunity to bolster its green credentials and send a message to consumers about its technological prowess.\u201cWe cannot pull back on electrification just because gas prices are low,\u201d Mr. Batey said. \u201cElectrification is here to stay, and we\u2019re investing in it for the long haul.\u201dThat attitude was applauded by dozens of Volt owners whom G.M. invited to its unveiling on Monday.Kate Sanford of Lansing, Mich., leased a Volt last year after previously owning a Chevrolet Malibu sedan.She had wanted the car for some time, she said, but waited until G.M. cut the sticker price last year in an effort to increase sales.\u201cI wanted a Volt not just because it saves gas, but because it\u2019s a statement car,\u201d said Ms. Sanford, a 56-year-old insurance company employee. \u201cThe fact that I can drive to and from work without using any fossil fuels is important to me.\u201dMs. Sanford said she drove solely on battery power about 80 percent of the time, and rarely had to fill up with gasoline. \u201cI\u2019ve driven it 17,000 miles, and taken it on long trips without any problem,\u201d she said.But despite her affection for the Volt, Ms. Sanford echoes the sentiments of many consumers about buying a purely electric car. Relying solely on a battery charge to drive, she said, is still out of her comfort zone.\u201cI\u2019m not ready to go all-electric yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t feel comfortable doing that until there are charging stations on every highway.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption in a slide show with this article misidentified the car being shown. The picture, No. 5 in the slide show, shows a Ford GT40, not a Mustang.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vaccine Critics Turn Defensive Over Measles ", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Their children have been sent home from school. Their families are barred from birthday parties and neighborhood play dates. Online, people call them negligent and criminal. And as officials in 14 states grapple to contain a spreading measles outbreak that began near here at Disneyland, the parents at the heart of America\u2019s anti-vaccine movement are being blamed for incubating an otherwise preventable public-health crisis.Measles anxiety rippled thousands of miles beyond its center on Friday as officials scrambled to try to contain a wider spread of the highly contagious disease \u2014 which America declared vanquished 15 years ago, before a statistically significant number of parents started refusing to vaccinate their children.In Arizona, health officials warned that 1,000 people could have been exposed to measles and urged anyone displaying symptoms to avoid this weekend\u2019s Super Bowl events in the Phoenix area. In a small planned community where one family became ill after visiting Disneyland, store windows were lined with measles alerts, and a sign on the Pinal County office building warned: \u201cStop! Measles is in our county!\u201d and asked people with symptoms to wear masks before entering.But here in California, anti-vaccine parents whose children have endured bouts of whooping cough and chickenpox largely defended their choice to raise their children on natural foods, essential oils and no vaccinations.\u201cThere is absolutely no reason to get the shot,\u201d said Crystal McDonald, whose 16-year-old daughter was one of 66 students sent home from Palm Desert High School for the next two weeks because they did not have full measles immunizations.After researching the issue and reading information from a national anti-vaccine group, Ms. McDonald said she and her husband, a chiropractor, decided to raise their four children without vaccines. She said they ate well and had never been to the doctor, and she insisted that her daughter was healthier than many classmates. But when the school sent her home with a letter, Ms. McDonald\u2019s daughter was so concerned about missing two weeks of Advanced Placement classes that she suggested simply getting a measles inoculation.\u201cI said, \u2018No, absolutely not,\u2019 \u201c Ms. McDonald said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019d rather you miss an entire semester than you get the shot.\u2019 \u201c\u201cSometimes, I feel like we\u2019re practicing in the 1950s,\u201d said Dr. Eric Ball, a pediatrician in southern Orange County, where some schools report that 50 to 60 percent of their kindergartners are not fully vaccinated and that 20 to 40 percent of parents have sought a personal beliefs exemption to vaccination requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating. It\u2019s hard to see a kid suffer for something that\u2019s entirely preventable.\u201dTwo of Dr. Ball\u2019s patients are unvaccinated girls who became sick with the measles last week, though they had not been at Disneyland and it was unclear how they had been infected. Their father called the clinic to tell Dr. Ball and has been sending digital photographs of the girls, their faces stippled with red dots, to update him on how they are doing.Dr. Ball said he spent many days trying to persuade parents to vaccinate their children. He tries to alleviate their concerns. He shows parents his own children\u2019s vaccine records. But it has not worked, and lately, as worries and anger over this outbreak have spread, some families who support vaccines have said they do not want to be in the same waiting room as unvaccinated families. The clinic where Dr. Ball works has treated unvaccinated children for years, but its staff is meeting next week to discuss a ban.\u201cOur patients are really scared,\u201d Dr. Ball said. \u201cOur nightmare would be for someone to show up at our door with the measles.\u201dThe county\u2019s vaccination rate for kindergartners is about 90 percent, a little lower than the statewide rate, 90.4 percent. But rates in some pockets, especially in the wealthier southern half, are sharply lower.\u201cThere are different threads of concern out there\u201d when it comes to vaccination, said Matt Zahn, the medical director for epidemiology at the Orange County Health Agency. \u201cIt becomes a game of Whack-a-Mole: As soon as you get rid of one issue, there\u2019s another.\u201dThe people most at risk of becoming seriously ill are babies too young to be vaccinated and the immunologically frail; measles can transform into something much worse, like encephalitis, and can be deadly. Among the fully vaccinated, the chances of contracting measles are small but do exist; the C.D.C. says the vaccine is more than 95 percent effective.On Friday, all unvaccinated students who had been sent home from Huntington Beach High School after a possible measles exposure were allowed to return to school. But in Riverside County, officials reporting a probable case of a school employee with the measles ordered 40 students without vaccinations to stay home.Similar scares are playing out far from Disneyland. In Kearny, Ariz., a small rural community with an economy tied to a nearby copper mine, a single family\u2019s Christmas vacation has upended the rhythms of daily life. The family visited Disneyland in December, and four of its unvaccinated members came back with measles; a fifth person in Kearny also contracted the disease.Now, many businesses in town \u2014 the grocery store, the post office, and more \u2014 have measles alerts in the windows featuring a blond boy with a rash all over his face. Several signs say that someone with the measles was in the store at a specific time last week and advise others who were there at the same time to be alert to symptoms.Some parents in Kearny are sympathetic to the family that did not vaccinate children.\u201cI strongly believe in getting children the vaccines they need to protect them from any childhood disease out there, but that is my opinion,\u201c said Tiffany Magee, a mother of three. \u201cI also strongly believe other parents have the right to choose not to get their children vaccinated due to religion or health reasons.\u201dKearny school officials sent a letter home to all parents, urging calm, noting that, other than the children in the affected family, all other students in the district had been vaccinated. But it also advised parents to keep an eye out for symptoms. The measles outbreak has dominated talk in town and in two Facebook groups that discuss Kearny goings-on, and it has altered the way some people in town think about vaccines.Missy Foster, 43, said she had not vaccinated her daughter, Tully, who is now 18 months old, against measles because of concern that the M.M.R. vaccine \u2014 which stands for measles, mumps and rubella, or German measles \u2014 might be associated with autism.A map of counties where cases have been reported so far this year, and a chart showing how the number of cases compares to previous years.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst shot,\u201d she said, with tears in her eyes. \u201cDo you want to wake up one morning and the light is gone from her eyes with autism or something?\u201dBut as soon as Ms. Foster heard about the measles outbreak, she called her pediatrician and scheduled the vaccine, still with trepidation about possible side effects but with greater worries about measles. Now she is planning to stay home, leaving only to go to church, until the vaccine fully takes effect.\u201cWe didn\u2019t think this would explode again, but it did,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cI want her to be protected.\u201dAnd Norm Warren, the manager of the supermarket in Kearny, Gordon\u2019s IGA, has changed his thinking toward those who do not vaccinate their children.\u201cBefore, I thought, \u2018If you think your child will become autistic, fine.\u2019 But now they\u2019re pushing their beliefs on everybody, and I feel differently,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many lives have been saved by vaccination?\u201dMembers of the anti-vaccine movement said the public backlash had terrified many parents. \u201cPeople are now afraid they\u2019re going to be jailed,\u201d said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a clearinghouse for resisters. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s gotten so out of hand, and it\u2019s gotten so vicious.\u201dIn San Geronimo, Calif., a mostly rural community of rolling hills and oak trees about 30 miles north of San Francisco, 40 percent of the students walking into Lagunitas Elementary School have not been inoculated against measles, according to the school\u2019s figures. Twenty-five percent have not been vaccinated for polio. In all, the state says that 58 percent of Lagunitas kindergartners do not have up-to-date vaccine records.\u201cA lot of people here have personal beliefs that are faith based,\u201d said John Carroll, the school superintendent, who sent a letter home to parents last week encouraging them to vaccinate their children. The faith, Mr. Carroll said, is not so much religious as it is a belief that \u201cthey raise their children in a natural, organic environment\u201d and are suspicious of pharmaceutical companies and big business.Some parents forgo shots altogether. Others split vaccine doses or stretch out their timeline, worried about somehow overwhelming their children\u2019s immune system. Kelly McMenimen, a Lagunitas parent, said she \u201cmeditated on it a lot\u201d before deciding not to vaccinate her son Tobias, 8, against even \u201cdeadly or deforming diseases.\u201d She said she did not want \u201cso many toxins\u201d entering the slender body of a bright-eyed boy who loves math and geography.Tobias has endured chickenpox and whooping cough, though Ms. McMenimen said the latter seemed more like a common cold. She considered a tetanus shot after he cut himself on a wire fence but decided against it: \u201cHe has such a strong immune system.\u201dAs Ciel Lorenzen, a massage therapist, picked up her children, Rio, 10, and Athena, 7, at Lagunitas Elementary, she defended her choice to not vaccinate either of them, even as health and school officials urged a different course.\u201cIt\u2019s good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you,\u201d she said. \u201cVaccines don\u2019t feel right for me and my family.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the outbreak of measles related to low vaccination rates in some communities referred incorrectly to the position of the Amish on preventive vaccines. While some Amish communities object to vaccinations, \u201cthe Amish\u201d as a whole do not.Jack Healy reported from Huntington Beach, and Michael Paulson from Kearny, Ariz.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Anti-Business Stance", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOO often the debate over how to restart Europe\u2019s economy veers into the conveniently crisp alternatives of stimulus versus austerity. Should the pressure to reduce government deficits be relaxed? Should central bank actions to lower interest rates have come sooner and been more aggressive?That simplistic debate has returned to the forefront, with the European Central Bank\u2019s plunge into purchasing the sovereign debt of its member nations and Greece\u2019s resounding vote at the ballot box against spending cuts.But the focus on macroeconomic policy underappreciates the critical importance of smaller structural problems that collectively amount to a bigger challenge for Europe. Archaic restrictions on hiring and firing workers, flawed energy policies and kilometers of red tape that can make even starting a business difficult \u2014 just to name a few \u2014 have combined to damage the Continent\u2019s ability to compete in increasingly global markets.Among major countries, France and Italy have these problems most acutely, with wages continuing to rise even as the efficiency of workers has stagnated. In France, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande arrived in office in 2012 atop a leftist wave and responded with policies that ranged from lowering the retirement age to 60 to raising corporate and value-added taxes.His policies have even managed to get French businessmen into the street, shouting \u201cenough is enough\u201d into megaphones \u2014 an expression of their frustration with the layers of regulations, such as a new requirement that all part-time jobs be at least 24 hours per week. Unpopular and under pressure from the European Union, Mr. Hollande has tacked modestly toward the center.Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s youthful new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, arrived determined to reverse three years of recession by overhauling problems such as rigid labor laws and a grindingly slow judicial system.After months of battling, he recently made progress on a bank reform bill and secured initial passage of his jobs act. That occasioned demonstrations and strikes across the country by workers who feared that it would succeed in dismantling Italy\u2019s 2,700 pages of labor market regulations, which effectively institutionalized inefficiency by making it exceptionally difficult to fire workers.Even generally sensible Germany has veered wildly off course in its energy policy. In the wake of the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan, the country, which derived about a quarter of its energy from low-cost nuclear power, has begun shutting down its reactors. That came on top of a requirement that utilities purchase specified amounts of clean power at prices far higher than electricity from conventional sources.A result is weakened competitiveness for Germany\u2019s much-vaunted industrial sector and suggestions by businessmen that new facilities requiring large amounts of power may be located in more hospitable countries. More positively, Spain, while still plagued by an unemployment rate of 23.7 percent, has managed to implement labor and tax reforms, helping the country to begin adding jobs again amid renewed economic growth.With all the problems facing Europe, the recent European Central Bank decision to buy bonds amounts to reaching into a medicine cabinet when the patient needs open-heart surgery. For one thing, high interest rates are hardly Europe\u2019s problem. France can borrow at 0.6 percent for 10 years, and even Spain and debt-laden Italy can borrow at around 1.5 percent.And despite robust European Central Bank financing programs, loan demand from the private sector remains weak. Since 2008, business investment has dropped about 15 percent.Many explanations are offered for why the eurozone is lagging. Some say it\u2019s lack of immigration. Sure, the United States has benefited enormously from the diversity and productivity of newcomers. But with 11.5 percent unemployment, the eurozone wouldn\u2019t seem to need more workers.Income inequality? Unlike the United States, where inequality has soared, on the Continent, the gap between the haves and the have-nots, although large, has widened only modestly.To be sure, in the appropriate context, more public spending and investment and commendable efforts to avoid deflation, like those of the European Central Bank, would be well advised.But under the present circumstances, such steps risk distracting the Continent even further from addressing its most serious challenges.Europe needs to become more competitive in global markets. That can be achieved only by a variety of policy changes, such as keeping top tax rates at sensible levels and regulatory reforms that would give companies more freedom to manage their businesses as they see fit, including, when necessary, closing plants and reducing head counts. That is the only viable path to sustainable growth and, ultimately, more jobs.Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, is a Wall Street financier. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong\u2019s Rebellious Tycoon, Next Battle May Be in Court", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong\u2019s most fiercely anti-Communist tycoon, calls himself a rebel who likes to make trouble \u2014 and he has found no shortage of it.The owner of the city\u2019s biggest pro-democracy publishing empire, Mr. Lai has seen his house firebombed and his company\u2019s offices ransacked; he has been the target of an assassination plot and, recently, of multiple online attacks by what he suspects were state-sponsored hackers. On Sunday night, unidentified attackers threw Molotov cocktails at the entrances to his home and his company\u2019s offices.But if the protests that brought swaths of Hong Kong to a standstill throughout the autumn were partly a culmination of his decades of promoting democracy, Mr. Lai, 66, finds perhaps his greatest test in their aftermath \u2014 one that could have repercussions for media freedom in Hong Kong and Beijing\u2019s growing intolerance of dissent in what was a British colony until 1997.It is the kind of political street fight he has been waiting for. On the afternoon of Sept. 28, Mr. Lai was hit with fragments from a tear-gas canister \u2014 one of 87 that riot police fired that day into the crowds of protesters, mainly young students.\u201cWe were standing there, and we saw people rush into the road and occupy it, and in that moment, I said, \u2018Oh my God, this is wonderful,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lai said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was the beginning.\u201dNow, Mr. Lai\u2019s fight looks set to shift from the streets to the courts. Outraged by what has been branded at best an illegal assembly and at worst an affront to China\u2019s sovereignty over the territory, the authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing formal charges against scores of people they have identified as the main figures in the Occupy protests. On Friday, Mr. Lai was instructed to report to police headquarters on Jan. 21.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting to see whether he is going to bear the heaviest weight as the blackest \u2018black hand,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michael DeGolyer, a professor of political economy at Hong Kong Baptist University, who runs a series of polls on democracy. Black hand is a term the Chinese authorities have used to refer to those who stir up antigovernment activity.\u201cYou could argue that he was perhaps the most significant supporter of Occupy Central, in terms of providing it a platform\u201d through his media outlets, Mr. DeGolyer added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a significant freedom of the press issue here, which is going to tell us a great deal about Hong Kong\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cSince the case is on, I better keep my mouth shut,\u201d Mr. Lai said. \u201cBut I think whatever comes, I will take it. I\u2019m not worried about this, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong.\u201dMr. Lai\u2019s path to the publishing business was an unlikely one. He was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the Communists took power in 1949. The family paid a smuggler to take him by boat to Hong Kong in 1960 at age 12. He began working and sleeping in one of the city\u2019s then numerous sweatshops, making knitwear.He did odd jobs at first, then became a knitter. He taught himself English along the way, enough to land a job as an office clerk at a trading firm in Central, the main business district. By the time Mr. Lai was 27, he and two partners had started their own small clothing factory, which by the late 1980s had grown into Hong Kong\u2019s first \u201cfast fashion\u201d retail chain, Giordano.When student protesters flooded the streets of Beijing in democracy demonstrations in the spring of 1989, Giordano did a brisk business in Hong Kong selling T-shirts printed with the slogan \u201cThe dynasty is dead, please step down\u201d in big, red Chinese characters. After the Chinese government ordered a military crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, Mr. Lai\u2019s politics hardened further.He decided to branch into media, starting Next Magazine the next year. The magazine divided its coverage between serious muckraking investigations and paparazzi-style expos\u00e9s of the private lives of local celebrities.Mr. Lai\u2019s weekly column in Next, which he still writes, took aim at the Chinese leadership in Beijing. One article in July 1994 repeatedly insulted Li Peng, the prime minister \u2014 who was seen as a driving force behind the 1989 military crackdown \u2014 and told him to \u201cdrop dead.\u201dWithin weeks, the authorities began closing Giordano stores in mainland China, the fastest-growing market for Mr. Lai\u2019s retail chain. Before long, Mr. Lai decided he had no choice but to sell the business.\u201cI was na\u00efve. Not that I expected something like this was going to happen, but neither did I expect it was going to be smooth sailing for my career in China,\u201d Mr. Lai said. \u201cIf I really treated business like a businessman, I wouldn\u2019t have done what I have done \u2014 opposing China. No businessman in their right mind would do this, because you know that there will be repercussions.\u201dMr. Lai used money from the sale of Giordano to invest further in media. In 1995 he started a newspaper, Apple Daily, which quickly became one of the biggest in Hong Kong. He then moved into Taiwan\u2019s much-larger media market, starting a Taiwanese edition of Next Magazine in 2001 and of Apple Daily in 2003. He later set up an animated news unit in Taiwan, Next Media Animation.Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing legislator and a delegate to China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress, said Mr. Lai\u2019s role as the main opposition media figure in Hong Kong, combined with his role as a financial backer of protest movements, benefits him financially because it sells newspapers.\u201cHe makes the money, and he uses the money to support the anti-establishment movement, and that creates more noise, and sells more papers. That\u2019s the game he\u2019s playing,\u201d said Mr. Tien, who also founded a chain of clothing stores, G2000, that competes against Giordano.Even within Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement, which is increasingly being led by a younger generation, the dominance in print, online and mobile news of Mr. Lai\u2019s publications can create unease.\u201cIt\u2019s unhealthy, and it even risks being controlled by one publication,\u201d he continued.\u201cThe more I\u2019m in the front of the movement, the less appropriate that I should be so closely connected with our media,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot have the media so close to you that it becomes your voice. This is no good, because it becomes too extreme and people will resent it.\u201dMr. Lai says he can see the day, maybe in 10 years, when print will cease to be economically viable and his publications will switch to digital platforms. He still owns 73.5 percent of Next Media and says he is adamantly against selling it.

{"Headline": "System That Powers City Is Shut Down by Threat of Snow", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkJust after 9 a.m. on Tuesday, the No-Show Snow transit system shutdown came to an end, and the first A train rumbled out of the 207th Street terminal. By the time it reached 125th Street, there were 66 passengers in the second car, maybe 500 on the entire train. Seats were scarce.The city, superpowered by a transit system thought to be all but invulnerable to heavy snows, had discovered that kryptonite could come disguised as a scary forecast.Apparently for the first time in the 110-year history of the city\u2019s subway system, it was completely closed by snow or its threat, said Thomas F. Prendergast, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cIn railroading, there is more of an awareness that \u2018damn the torpedoes, run the trains\u2019 is not the most prudent course,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shift in the paradigm.\u201dIn his mind, he said, were memories of riders stranded for hours after a snowstorm on Dec. 26, 2010, and of 30 to 40 stalled trains.\u201cI was guided by that as a learning experience: What did you expose those people to?\u201d Mr. Prendergast said, adding that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo agreed with his strong recommendation to shut down the subways.6 PhotosBut the National Weather Service forecast grew more dire. (Other sources predicted a milder storm for the city.) \u201cI became more and more concerned,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said. At 4 in the afternoon, he and the governor agreed to an 11 p.m. closing.Weren\u2019t lesser measures possible?\u201cVery few of the lines are totally underground,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said. \u201cHiving off an underground portion of the system, we don\u2019t have a plan to do that. Not for an ad hoc service.\u201dIn the December 2010 storm, an hour of intense weather caused the most damage, he said. The high winds and falling snow predicted for late Monday night and early Tuesday might have reduced visibility to nil.By 3 or 4 a.m. on Tuesday, it was clear that the storm itself was far more trivial than the alarm. But once the system has been shut down \u2014 with trains stored for safekeeping in tunnels far from their regular yards \u2014 it is not easily revived. Crews had to be brought in to run the equipment, without subways to get them to it. \u201cThat\u2019s why among many rail people, there is a general belief it\u2019s better to keep it going,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said Tuesday.But even then, you could ride a subway train when it snowed. One morning after a big storm, I inveigled about 10 college friends to take the D train downtown from the Bronx so we could pick up the school newspaper, which was marooned at the printing plant by impassable roads. The bundles rode back to the Bronx with us.All in a snowstorm, on barely working, half-lit trains.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Central Bank\u2019s Bond-Buying Will Help U.S. Tourists and Investors", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven if the E.C.B.\u2019s effort is ultimately successful and the eurozone emerges from the business equivalent of hibernation \u2014 hardly a certainty \u2014 that added growth is unlikely to move the American economic needle.The weaker euro, though, is good news for Americans with plans to visit Europe as the spring and summer travel season arrives, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Spending on hotels, meals and taxis will be cheaper since dollars have greater spending power in the 19 countries where the euro is the official currency.\u201cThis is great for tourists, as Europe is getting cheaper by the day,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cBut don\u2019t buy euros now \u2014 wait for the trip. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if the euro was even with the dollar by April.\u201dOn Thursday, the euro dropped by more than 2 percent against the dollar, to just below $1.14. Many analysts say they expect the euro to continue falling, possibly reaching parity with the dollar in the coming months.As for stocks, added liquidity in global markets tends to benefit equity prices broadly, even if the stimulus is not coming from the Federal Reserve this time around. For example, Wall Street rallied in the fall after Japan\u2019s central bank expanded its asset purchasing program in late October.And some of the euros pumped into the economy by the European Central Bank will find their way to Wall Street. On Thursday, traders cheered the announcement by policy makers in Frankfurt, with broad market averages in the United States rising by more than 1.5 percent.\u201cThere has been a debate about whether other central banks can substitute for the U.S. in terms of liquidity, and the answer today seems to be yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combination of the Bank of Japan and the E.C.B. should at least compensate for the Fed, and maybe add more.\u201dAs for the broader American economy, most economists said the overall impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s move on these shores is likely to be muted.For example, in 2013, total, global American exports of $3.2 trillion contributed 13.4 percent to G.D.P. Of that $3.2 trillion, less than a quarter went to the eurozone, according to Commerce Department data. Anything but a dramatic surge in European demand would be felt only slightly in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s modestly negative, but rounding-size-error negative in terms of growth, maybe one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d Mr. Hanson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.Some European imports, such as luxury goods, could conceivably fall in price, although discounts for high-end fashion and watches tend to be rarer than for mass-market goods. And some European automakers now produce many their cars in the United States, further reducing any currency benefit for car buyers.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, echoed Mr. Hanson\u2019s view that the big picture for the American economy, which has been rosier as of late, is unlikely to be dimmed by any fallout from Europe.He estimates the American economy grew at an annual rate of just over 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, with growth over the course of 2015 coming at just under 3 percent. A large portion of those gains will come from healthier spending by American consumers who are benefiting from the plunge in energy prices.\u201cNobody\u2019s growth outlook for the U.S. will change after what happened today,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cWhatever drove your forecast before is still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How My Mom Got Hacked ", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMY mother received the ransomnote on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. It popped up on her computer screen soon after she\u2019d discovered that all of her files had been locked. \u201cYour files are encrypted,\u201d it announced. \u201cTo get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD.\u201d If my mother failed to pay within a week, the price would go up to $1,000. After that, her decryption key would be destroyed and any chance of accessing the 5,726 files on her PC \u2014 all of her data \u2014 would be lost forever.Sincerely, CryptoWall.CryptoWall 2.0 is the latest immunoresistant strain of a larger body of viruses known as ransomware. The virus is thought to infiltrate your computer when you click on a legitimate-looking attachment or through existing malware lurking on your hard drive, and once unleashed it instantly encrypts all your files, barring access to a single photo or tax receipt.Everyone has the same questions when they first hear about CryptoWall:Is there any other way to get rid of it besides paying the ransom? No \u2014 it appears to be technologically impossible for anyone to decrypt your files once CryptoWall 2.0 has locked them. (My mother had several I.T. professionals try.)But should you really be handing money over to a bunch of criminals? According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, this answer is also no. \u201cRansomware messages are an attempt to extort money,\u201d one public service announcement helpfully explains. \u201cIf you have received a ransomware message do not follow payment instructions and file a complaint.\u201d Right. But that won\u2019t get you your files back. Which is why the Sheriff\u2019s Office of Dickson County, Tenn., recently paid a CryptoWall ransom to unlock 72,000 autopsy reports, witness statements, crime scene photographs and other documents.Finally, can law enforcement at least do something to stop these attacks in the future? Probably not. Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn\u2019t finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them.By the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally \u2014 the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn\u2019t the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay.Only, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins.Picture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures.She\u2019d managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin \u201cwallet\u201d provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin\u2019s price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. (Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That\u2019s where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, not too far from where I lived.The Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not.Inside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. \u201cBalance query in progress,\u201d it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe\u2019s voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain.The fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M.We got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting role of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn\u2019t like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their \u201cfast, simple service.\u201d That\u2019s how my mom found out about Coin Cafe \u2014 from her ransom note.This referral is only one of the handy services CryptoWall provides to ensure a more seamless customer experience. Others include the ability to \u201cdecrypt one file for free\u201d and a message interface one can use \u201cin case of any problems with payment or having any other questions.\u201d What next, I wondered. Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials?\u201cI THINK they like the idea they don\u2019t have to pretend they\u2019re not criminals,\u201d Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. \u201cBy using the fact that they\u2019re criminals to scare you, it\u2019s just a lot easier on them.\u201d They don\u2019t have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance.In addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of \u201ca very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.\u201d It\u2019s also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus.Even after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as \u201cthe largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet\u201d and \u201can enormous danger for computer users,\u201d I still couldn\u2019t help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher.So what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and \u201cpatch\u201d alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.)Of course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words.So she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived.When I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. \u201cThat is great news, truly!\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.\u201dBut Mr. Wisniewski had a more pragmatic take. \u201cFrom what we can tell, they almost always honor what they say because they want word to get around that they\u2019re trustworthy criminals who\u2019ll give you your files back.\u201dWelcome to the new ransomware economy, where hackers have a reputation to consider.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real Estate in Manhattan Set Sales Records in 2014", "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a banner year for Manhattan real estate. In 2014, buoyed by sales of ultraluxury apartments in new developments, the real estate market rebounded to surpass its previous peak, reached in 2008, when the financial crisis hit, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. The average sales price reached a new high of $1,718,530 last year, surpassing the record set in 2008, when the average sales price for the year was $1,591,823, according to Mr. Miller, the author of a report for Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Big-ticket closings also helped the average price per square foot climb to a record $1,297 for the year, above the previous high of $1,251 per square foot in 2008. The median apartment price, which measures the middle of the market and is less affected by high-end sales, was $940,000 in 2014, just behind the record of $955,000 set in 2008, according to Miller Samuel. The year ended on a high note, with the market performing very well in the fourth quarter, according to reports to be released on Tuesday by the city\u2019s major brokerages. \u201cIt was an extremely strong year,\u201d said Sofia\u00a0Song, the head of research at Urban Compass, which reported record dollar volume in the fourth quarter of 2014 with approximately $5.4 billion in closed deals. \u201cProperties were being snapped up faster and at higher closing prices than the 2008 market peak.\u201d The median time an apartment spent on the market in 2014 was 46 days, according to Urban Compass, down from 64 days during peak market activity in 2008. A strong local economy, surging stock market and steady foreign interest helped bolster demand for Manhattan apartments, as supply remained a challenge. After hitting bottom at the end of 2013, inventory has been on the rise, with 5,912 available listings in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 20 percent from 4,913 in the same period last year, according to the Corcoran Group\u2019s report. Still, the report noted, the number is 52 percent below the peak in the first quarter of 2009, when there were 12,336\u00a0listings.\u201cWhen people see people spending money like that they feel good about investing in the city,\u201d said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, which reported half of all apartments in the fourth quarter sold at or above list prices, the highest percentage in six years. \u201cBuyers were super confident and sellers were able to achieve these extraordinary prices,\u201d said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group. \u201cAnd there\u2019s really no sign of things slowing down.\u201dThe number of contracts signed in the fourth quarter, 3,216, was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006, when 3,246 were signed, according to the Corcoran Group. Co-ops accounted for 58 percent of signed contracts this quarter, the highest co-op market share since the third quarter of 2009. While overall condominium inventory has been on the rise, the fresh supply has come mainly from new buildings with large and expensive residences. \u201cWe are desperate for two bedrooms and anything below $1.5 million is sure to disappear quickly as that segment of the market continues to be the most in demand and at the same time the most inventory challenged,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. But don\u2019t expect many bargains. The agency forecasts \u201cmodest reductions in median closing prices,\u201d with Manhattan prices remaining steady or dropping slightly. Advertisement"}

Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.We are 15 years into this new century, 15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. (Applause.) Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we\u2019ve been in almost 30 years. (Applause.)Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. (Applause.)America, for all that we\u2019ve endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. (Applause.)At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It\u2019s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? (Applause.)Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I\u2019ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\u201cIf only we had known,\u201d Rebekah wrote to me last spring, \u201cwhat was about to happen to the housing and construction market.\u201dAs the crisis worsened, Ben\u2019s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.They sacrificed for each other, and slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben\u2019s back in construction and home for dinner every night.\u201cIt is amazing,\u201d Rebekah wrote, \u201cwhat you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.\u201d\u201cWe are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.\u201dAmerica, Rebekah and Ben\u2019s story is our story. They represent the millions who\u2019ve worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. (Applause.)We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. (Applause.)And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. (Applause.)We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. More Americans finish college than ever before. (Applause.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. (Applause.)At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we\u2019ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.)This is good news, people. (Laughter.) So \u2014 (applause) -- so the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.We can\u2019t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can\u2019t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we\u2019ve got to fix a broken system.And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will veto it. It will have earned my veto. (Applause.)Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees\u2019 pay than at any time since 2007.But here\u2019s the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn\u2019t screw things up, the government doesn\u2019t halt the progress we\u2019re making. We need to do more than just do no harm.Tonight, together, let\u2019s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. (Applause.)Because families like Rebekah\u2019s still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they\u2019ve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, that\u2019s a big splurge. Basic child care for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn\u2019t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them.That\u2019s what middle-class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) We don\u2019t just want everyone to share in America\u2019s success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. (Applause.)So -- so what does middle-class economics require in our time?First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement, and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. (Applause.)Here\u2019s one example: During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the work force was a national security priority. So this country provided universal child care.In today\u2019s economy, when having both parents in the work force is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality child care more than ever. (Applause.)It\u2019s not a nice-to-have: it\u2019s a must-have. So it\u2019s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a women\u2019s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. (Applause.)And that\u2019s why my plan will make quality child care more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. (Applause.)Here\u2019s another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that.And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I\u2019ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\u2019s put it to a vote right here in Washington. (Applause.) Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.It\u2019s the right thing to do. (Applause.)Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That\u2019s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. (Applause.) It\u2019s 2015. It\u2019s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they\u2019ve earned -- (applause) -- and everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. (Laughter.) If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. (Applause.)These ideas won\u2019t make everybody rich, won\u2019t relieve every hardship. That\u2019s not the job of government.To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter\u2019s earnings and recognize that investing in their work force is in their company\u2019s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. (Applause.)But -- but you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That\u2019s a fact. And that\u2019s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. (Applause.)Now America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of G.I.s to college, trained the best work force in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It\u2019s not fair to them, and it\u2019s sure not smart for our future. That\u2019s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. (Applause.)Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you\u2019ve got to earn it. You\u2019ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. (Applause.) Let\u2019s stay ahead of the curve.And -- and I want to work with this Congress to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn\u2019t derail anyone\u2019s dreams. (Applause.)Thanks to Vice President Biden\u2019s great work to update our job training system, we\u2019re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics.Tonight, I\u2019m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs, even if they don\u2019t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.Already, we\u2019ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care, we\u2019re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we\u2019re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.And joining forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle, thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. (Applause.)So to every C.E.O. in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who\u2019s going to get the job done, and done right, hire a veteran. (Applause.)Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. (Applause.)Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn\u2019t even exist 10 or 20 years ago: jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. (Applause.) We know that.That\u2019s why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.Twenty-first-century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. (Applause.)Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline; let\u2019s pass a bipartisan -- (applause) -- infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s get it done. (Applause.) Let\u2019s get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe -- (applause) -- that aren\u2019t just free but are also fair. It\u2019s the right thing to do.Look, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the first one to admit -- I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone after countries \u2014 (applause) -- that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders. We can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they\u2019re actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let\u2019s give them one more reason to get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine: one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. (Applause.)In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I\u2019m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. (Applause.)I intend to protect a free and open Internet, to extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again. (Applause.)Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space. So good luck, Captain. (Applause.) Make sure to Instagram it. We\u2019re proud of you.Now, the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there\u2019s bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so.Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don\u2019t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too.But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They\u2019ve riddled it with giveaways that the super rich don\u2019t need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. (Applause.) Let\u2019s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let\u2019s simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. (Applause.)And let\u2019s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. (Applause.) We can achieve it together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it\u2019s where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there\u2019s one thing this new century has taught us, it\u2019s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not -- in doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That\u2019s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don\u2019t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who\u2019ve been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.We will continue \u2014 (applause) -- to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. (Applause.)At the same time, we\u2019ve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we\u2019ve trained their security forces, who\u2019ve now taken the lead, and we\u2019ve honored our troops\u2019 sacrifice by supporting that country\u2019s first democratic transition.Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we\u2019re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL\u2019s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. (Applause.)We\u2019re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. (Applause.) We need that authority.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We\u2019re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\u2019t bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. (Applause.)Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That\u2019s what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That\u2019s how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. (Applause.)In Cuba, we are ending a policy \u2014 (applause) -- that was long past its expiration date. When what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for 50 years, it\u2019s time to try something new. (Applause.) And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere and removes the phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. (Applause.)As -- as His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. (Applause.) Welcome home, Alan. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we\u2019ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There\u2019re no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails, alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn\u2019t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Applause.) The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we\u2019re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. (Applause.)But we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children\u2019s information. That should be a bipartisan effort. (Applause.)You know, if we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. (Applause.) I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. (Applause.) 2014 was the planet\u2019s warmest year on record.Now, one year doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I\u2019ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they\u2019re not scientists, that we don\u2019t have enough information to act. Well, I\u2019m not a scientist either. But you know what? I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities, and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don\u2019t act forcefully, we\u2019ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. (Applause.)That\u2019s why, over the past six years, we\u2019ve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that\u2019s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. (Applause.)In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world\u2019s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we\u2019ve got.And There\u2019s one last pillar of our leadership, and that\u2019s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\u2019re threatened, which is why I\u2019ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. (Applause.) It\u2019s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. (Applause.)It\u2019s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That\u2019s why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do -- (applause) -- but because ultimately, they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. (Applause.)Since I\u2019ve been president, we\u2019ve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. (Applause.) It\u2019s time to close Gitmo.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.And next month, we\u2019ll issue a report on how we\u2019re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading always with the example of our values. That\u2019s what makes us exceptional. That\u2019s what keeps us strong. And that\u2019s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn\u2019t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United States of America.I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world\u2019s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn\u2019t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It\u2019s held up as proof not just of my own flaws, of which there are many, but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, na\u00efve, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together \u2014 (applause) -- we can do great things, even when the odds are long.I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. I\u2019ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I\u2019ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, and West Texas, and West Virginia. I\u2019ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.I\u2019ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal \u2014 (applause) -- in states that seven in ten Americans call home.So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother\u2019s keeper, and our sister\u2019s keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America\u2019s hopes. I\u2019ve served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.And many of you have told me that this isn\u2019t what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fund-raising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different.Understand, a better politics isn\u2019t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine; a better politics is one where we appeal to each other\u2019s basic decency instead of our basest fears.A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts, rather than \u201cgotcha\u201d moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people\u2019s daily lives. (Applause.)A politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we\u2019re going to have arguments, let\u2019s have arguments. But let\u2019s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.We still may not agree on a woman\u2019s right to choose, but surely, we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. (Applause.)Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it\u2019s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I\u2019ve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That\u2019s something that we can share.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred \u2014 (applause) -- that it\u2019s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. (Applause.)We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can\u2019t walk home without being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won\u2019t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. (Applause.)And surely we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America\u2019s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. (Applause.)That\u2019s a better politics. That\u2019s how we start rebuilding trust. That\u2019s how we move this country forward. That\u2019s what the American people want. That\u2019s what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda -- (applause, laughter) -- I know, because I won both of them. (Applause, laughter.) My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I\u2019ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America.If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you\u2019ll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. (Applause.)Because -- because I want this chamber, I want this city, to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances \u2014 (applause) -- as committed as we are we are to working on behalf of our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters.I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. (Applause.) I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sums up these past six years:\u201cIt is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\u201dMy fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write.Let\u2019s begin this new chapter together, and let\u2019s start the work right now.Thank you. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless this country we love. Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Singapore, Central Bank Eases Currency Policy", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s central bank eased its monetary policy on Wednesday, becoming the latest central bank using policy to help shore up growth against a backdrop of global economic turbulence.In a surprise move, the bank said it would take measures to slow the appreciation of the Singapore dollar. The news from the Monetary Authority of Singapore comes as central banks around the world have taken action in recent weeks to ease policies amid steep falls in the price of oil and broader economic uncertainty.Singapore\u2019s central bank said it would slow the pace of appreciation of the dollar within a targeted band, citing recent developments in both global and domestic environments. The currency of Singapore, a city-state, is set against a basket of currencies within an undisclosed range. Adjusting its currency is one of the government\u2019s main policy tools.The currency dropped 1.4 percent to 1.35 Singapore dollars against the United States dollar on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than four years.Central banks in China and South Korea also cut borrowing costs last year.These policy actions may have helped prompt Singapore\u2019s central bank to take action, analysts at the bank HSBC said Wednesday.\u201cThis has perhaps led to concerns that Singapore\u2019s exports \u2014 both in goods and crucially in services as well \u2014 would feel competitive pressure, especially from other Asian economies,\u201d the analysts said in a note to clients.On Wednesday, the central bank also cut its inflation forecast for 2015, saying that the outlook had \u201cshifted significantly\u201d because of lower oil prices. Declines in the price of oil have led to a sharp fall in import prices.For several years, Singapore has felt the impact of slowing global economic growth.

{"Headline": "Fall in Eurozone Prices Inflames Fears of Deflation", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Consumer prices in the 19-country eurozone fell in January for a second consecutive month, compared with a year earlier, according to data released Friday.Together, the data reinforce fears that the region could lapse into a sustained period of sluggish or falling prices that could lead to an even higher jobless rate and economic stagnation.But among economists there is a divergence of opinion about whether the fears are justified. Some say the 19 nations in the currency bloc have been in de facto deflation for months. Others say falling prices are a boon for consumers and no reason for panic.Deflation \u2014 a vicious cycle of declining business revenue, sagging wages and rising joblessness \u2014 has been a marker of economic disaster. The United States had deflation during the Great Depression. Germany had deflation just before Hitler took over. Japan is still trying to escape a vicious deflationary circle that began in the 1990s.Fear of worryingly low inflation was a big reason the European Central Bank recently decided to begin a big program of bond buying, in hopes of stimulating the eurozone economy and nudging inflation closer to its target of just below 2 percent.\u201dThe average citizen in the world does not understand the consequences of what deflation is,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, in investment fund, said recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cIt\u2019s the Darth Vader death star outside of the atmosphere of the Earth shooting a laser to blow up the world.\u201dOther economists say that the current modest decline of prices in the eurozone, caused largely by plunging oil prices, is benign \u2014 and even beneficial. \u201dDeflation is one of the most abused terms in economic history,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist of Commerzbank in Frankfurt.He said that falling wages and prices in countries like Greece and Spain were helping to restore them to international competitiveness. And price declines have effectively raised the disposable incomes of eurozone consumers by 1 percent. \u201cThis is positive deflation,\u201d he said.On Friday, the European Union statistics bureau, Eurostat, said consumer prices fell by 0.6 percent in January after a decline of 0.2 percent in December. A nearly 9 percent drop in the oil prices and other energy costs accounted for most of the decline.What alarmed some economists, though, was a low in the eurozone\u2019s so-called core inflation rate, which does not count things like energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, whose prices often fluctuate greatly.Although prices as measured by core inflation did not actually fall, the rate of increase dipped in January to a level that economists consider worrisomely low \u2014 0.6 percent, down from 0.7 percent in December.\u201cThe real cause for concern lies in the slowdown in core inflation, and in services prices,\u201d Tom Rogers, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in an email.Price declines become toxic when consumers begin to delay purchases in anticipation of even lower prices. When consumer spending falls, companies earn less revenue and face pressure to dismiss workers or cut wages, creating a vicious circle of declining economic activity.It was that risk that helped prompt the European Central Bank to announce on Jan. 22 that it would spend 1.1 trillion euros, or $1.24 trillion, through September 2016 buying eurozone government bonds and other assets.Stefano Micossi, director general of Assonime, an association of publicly listed Italian companies, said he was worried about deflation until the central bank acted. Now, he said Friday, he has become more optimistic.\u201dWhat we have now is really a powerful monetary expansion,\u201d Mr. Micossi said. \u201cIt comes at the right time. The fall of the economy is coming to a halt.\u201dIn fact, the unemployment data published Friday provided a glimmer of good news. The jobless rate in the eurozone dipped to 11.4 percent in December after coming in at 11.5 percent in November, according to Eurostat. Economists had expected the rate to stay at 11.5 percent.In all 28 countries in the European Union, unemployment fell to 9.9 percent from 10 percent, the first time it was in single digits since October 2011.The eurozone has experienced periods of falling prices before. Consumer prices fell for five months in 2009, during the global financial crisis, with a 0.6 percent decline in July of that year, compared with a year earlier. But inflation returned and rose quickly as the eurozone began to recover.The current bout of falling prices, though, comes after six years of weak growth, and many economists are pessimistic about the prospect of a quick recovery. Despite modest progress, countries like France and Italy need to do more to improve economic performance, many say, such as revising labor laws or streamlining approval procedures for businesses.In addition, countries that have healthy government budget surpluses, like Germany, have been reluctant to spend more on public works to stimulate growth. Germany\u2019s unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in December, was the lowest in the eurozone.Many economists say that the central bank stimulus, which will involve buying 60 billion in eurozone assets each month starting in March, will be of little use unless governments do their part by creating conditions for better job creation.That is also a common refrain among business executives like Maximilian Zimmerer, chief financial officer of German insurer Allianz. Mr. Zimmerer said eurozone countries needed to do more to become competitive.\u201cThere are still a lot of reforms to be done,\u201d Mr. Zimmerer said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the amount in dollars of government bonds and other debt that the European Central Bank plans to buy.

{"Headline": "Kerry, at Davos, Urges Multipronged Fight Against Violent Extremism", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday called for an ambitious campaign to combat the root causes of violent extremism, which he said represented one of the most grave threats to international order since the end of World War II.In a lengthy address to a gathering here of world leaders and business executives, Mr. Kerry said that combating the Islamic State should be a top priority because the militant group was strong enough to seize and control territory in Syria and Iraq and posed a danger to the Middle East region.But Mr. Kerry also urged the international community to mount efforts to reduce unemployment and carry out other programs that could dissuade young people from joining extremist causes, even if such initiatives were costly.\u201cWhen the United States and our allies made stopping fascism a priority, we found the $3.6 trillion to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, recalling the push to rebuild Europe\u2019s economy after World War II. \u201cLeader after leader in country after country has said that fighting the scourge of violent extremism is a global priority. Well, let\u2019s prove it.\u201d During his address, Mr. Kerry announced that he would fly to Nigeria, which has been racked by attacks by Boko Haram, the extremist group whose fighters have killed thousands of people in northern Nigeria.Mr. Kerry was not the only speaker on Friday to take up the threat posed by extremist groups.

Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi of Iraq asserted that his nation was at the forefront in battling Islamic State militants and appealed for more international support.Mr. Kerry\u2019s address, however, was the most impassioned, though short on specifics. While he urged that more resources be committed for a long-term effort to fight extremists, he did not say where the money should come from or how it should be spent. Instead, he pointed to a security summit that President Obama plans to host on Feb. 18 \u201cto exchange ideas and galvanize support.\u201dResponding to critics who have urged the United States to specifically denounce Islamic extremism, Mr. Kerry said that leaders should be careful with their terminology and should avoid blaming the Muslim faith for attacks carried out by terrorists. \u201cWe will certainly not defeat our foes by vilifying potential partners,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cWe may very well fuel the very fires that we want to put out.\u201dThough Mr. Kerry urged the international community to prepare for a long-term struggle against what he called \u201ccriminal anarchy,\u201d he insisted that the American-backed effort to confront the Islamic State has already begun to show results.\u201cToday in much of Iraq, Daesh\u2019s momentum has dissipated,\u201d said Mr. Kerry, using an alternative name for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL.Ayad Allawi, a former Iraqi prime minister who serves as vice president in the current government, asserted in a separate appearance here that many of the claims of progress against the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria were exaggerated.\u201cI have not seen a coherent strategy yet,\u201d Mr. Allawi said. \u201cWhat we see is scattered efforts.\u201d Alison Smale contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Franc Soars After Central Bank Drops Cap", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Switzerland stunned the markets on Thursday by abandoning a crucial part of its effort to hold down the value of its currency, concluding that the strategy was too risky and too costly given the enormous forces pushing in the other direction. The move underscores the turbulent state of the global economy. Around the world, smaller economies are grappling with how to navigate the aggressive monetary activism of major central banks like the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank.The Swiss central bank had been trying to cap the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, with nervous investors fleeing the market tumult and seeking the relative safety of Switzerland. But the euro\u2019s decline has been particularly steep \u2014 and the rout may accelerate.The European Central Bank is expected to announce a major new stimulus program next week to pump money into the region\u2019s troubled economy, which is creating downward pressure on the euro. That pressure is particularly marked against the dollar, which is rising in part because of a strong United States economy and plans by the Fed to raise interest rates.If the Europeans undertake such an effort, it would make it that much more expensive for the Swiss to buy enough euros to maintain the value of the franc. So the Swiss leaders\u2019 abandonment of its target was taken as a bet that easier money from the European Central Bank is on the way, and potentially on a vast scale.\u201cRecently, divergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas have increased significantly \u2014 a trend that is likely to become even more pronounced,\u201d the Swiss central bank said in the announcement.The abrupt decision on Thursday sent the value of the Swiss franc soaring, as the country\u2019s stocks broadly plummeted. The shares of exporters, in particular, got slammed over fears that the rising currency would weigh on profit.\u201cWords fail me!\u201d Nick Hayek, the chief executive of the Swiss watchmaker the Swatch Group, said in a statement distributed to news media, adding that today\u2019s action \u201cis a tsunami: for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.\u201dAs panic set in, investors and savers dumped euros in favor of the Swiss franc and other safe havens. The rising value of the Swiss franc, however, could contribute to pushing the country into deflation and create problems for the country\u2019s exporters, which suddenly found their products less competitive overseas. Switzerland\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on such companies.The Swiss central bank\u2019s strategy, which involves selling francs on the open market in exchange for euros, has been controversial at home. Many exporters had welcomed the decision to hold down the franc.But as the central bank\u2019s balance sheet grew by several hundred billion euros, the central bank came under fire from opponents. In a December referendum, those critics tried to force the central bank to convert much of its foreign exchange holdings into gold. That initiative failed.\u201cThis exceptional and temporary measure protected the Swiss economy from serious harm,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cWhile the Swiss franc is still high, the overvaluation has decreased as a whole since the introduction of the minimum exchange rate. The economy was able to take advantage of this phase to adjust to the new situation.\u201dPhyllis Papadavid, foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London, said after the Swiss central bank action that monetary authorities were \u201cstill sensitive\u201d to the overvaluation of the franc, but that they had adapted to changed conditions \u2014 particularly the dollar\u2019s recent rise \u2014 by changing course.\u201cThey haven\u2019t given up,\u201d Ms. Papadavid said. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly going to continue watching it.\u201dAs it scrapped the cap, the Swiss central bank simultaneously cut interest rates, already in negative terrain, hoping to offset some of the damage in foreign exchange markets. It changed the rate on deposits to minus 0.75 percent from minus 0.25 percent, tripling what it costs lenders to park money at the central bank.But that was too little to stop the tide, and the franc jolted 15 percent higher against the euro. Swiss stocks plummeted in value as investors hastened to sell equities priced in francs.Shares of Swatch, the global watch brand, fell 16 percent, leading the Swiss Market Index nearly 9 percent lower. But the decline was broad-based, including Nestl\u00e9, the food manufacturer; Holcim, the giant cement maker; and the chemical company Syngenta.\u201cWe can only guess at what was in their minds,\u201d Carl B. Weinberg, chief global economist at High Frequency Economics, said of the Swiss central bank\u2019s move. \u201cMaybe they are afraid that the euro is coming on some hard times, and they didn\u2019t want to be tied to a sinking ship.\u201dMr. Weinberg said it was hard at the moment to tell what the fallout would ultimately be, but that it would mainly be \u201cmicro effects, rather than macro effects.\u201d\u201cA lot of people were borrowing in Swiss francs because they were cheap,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said. \u201cWell, anyone who borrowed in francs now owes something like 15 percent more than they did yesterday.\u201d\u201cBut anyone who has Swiss assets is a little bit richer today,\u201d he added. \u201cNet, there are winners and losers.\u201dDavid Jolly reported from Paris and Neil Irwin from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tsipras\u2019s Debt Plan Sends Athens Stock Market Sliding", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Investors made clear on Wednesday the depth of their concerns about Greece\u2019s new leftist-led government, driving up its borrowing costs, pushing down stock prices and highlighting the risks in the country\u2019s banking system.Later, the new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, appeared to harden the tone, saying that Greece\u2019s bailout deals were \u201ca toxic mistake\u201d and that the new government was determined to change the logic of how the crisis had been tackled. Mr. Varoufakis said the new government would seek what he called a Pan-European New Deal, which would be a bridge between previous agreements and a new arrangement with creditors. He did not elaborate, though, on what such a plan would look like.The White House confirmed that Mr. Tsipras spoke by telephone on Wednesday with President Obama, who has generally been critical of Europe's austerity approach and supportive of more growth-oriented policies. But Mr. Obama has also recognized the need for structural reforms to accompany growth policies.The White House would describe the telephone conversation only in general terms. But a spokesman made clear that Mr. Obama favored a balanced strategy.\u201cThe United States looks forward to working closely with the new Greek government to build on recent structural reforms, which lay the groundwork for economic recovery,\u201d Mark Stroh, a White House spokesman, said in a written statement. \u201cWe will also continue to discuss ways to boost demand and job creation with our European partners to help foster an environment that supports reforms in Greece and elsewhere in Europe.\u201dWhile many Greeks were hopeful that Mr. Tsipras would follow through with even a fraction of his populist promises, investors were rattled. The Athens Stock Exchange, where billions of euros in value were wiped out during Greece\u2019s election campaign, fell 9.2 percent on Wednesday after slumping around 11 percent on Tuesday. Shares in banks in Greece plummeted nearly 27 percent on Wednesday.The yield on Greek 10-year government bonds spiked on Wednesday to about 10.1 percent, up from 9.25 percent when the day began, on investor unease over a possible debt restructuring. The yields were at 8.4 percent before the election and below 6 percent for most of the summer, as the Greek economy appeared poised to grow again under the prime minister at the time, Antonis Samaras.If bond yields, indicative of the new government\u2019s borrowing costs, remained at such elevated levels, that would make it even harder to stimulate the economy and manage the country\u2019s debt.European Union officials also outlined a tough-sounding position on Wednesday before what would no doubt be long negotiations over the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout and an effort by the new government to reduce the country\u2019s mountain of debt.Since 2010, the so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 has extended Greece two bailouts worth \u20ac240 billion, or about $270 billion.A vice president of the European Commission, Jyrki Katainen, said on Wednesday that Brussels was eager to start talks with Greece. But noting that he saw no majority in favor of writing off any Greek debt, he added: \u201cWe expect them to fulfill everything that they have promised to fulfill.\u201dHe emphasized that Brussels could not simply look at the popular anti-austerity excitement surrounding the Greek elections, but that he had to take into account the wishes of people in other countries, including Finns and Germans who were not inclined to give Greece a penny more. \u201cWe don\u2019t change our policy according to elections,\u201d he said.Mr. Katainen\u2019s remarks suggested Brussels\u2019s opening bargaining position, and they did not necessarily mean that European officials would not offer concessions. But they put the heat on Athens, especially since there is not much time to reach a deal: Greece\u2019s current European bailout, already extended, ends in late February unless there is another extension.\u201cWe need to start working together very soon because the commitments have not changed and time is running out,\u201d Mr. Katainen told reporters.Asked whether Greece would be able to persuade creditors to write off some of its debt, Mr. Katainen said he thought that this was a nonstarter, at least in the Eurogroup, a grouping of finance ministers from the 19 countries, including Greece, that use the euro.\u201cIt would be difficult to see that there would be a majority in the Eurogroup supporting a haircut in Greek debt,\u201d said Mr. Katainen, a former prime minister of Finland, which has strongly supported Germany in demanding that Athens pay its bills.In the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Tsipras set out his government\u2019s top priorities in order: tackling what he called the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis, stimulating the economy so it could start growing sustainably, entering into a new negotiation with creditors aimed at finding a \u201cmutually beneficial solution to the debt,\u201d creating a \u201cfairer\u201d tax system, and confronting vested interests and corruption \u201cthat no one has had the guts to go against.\u201dHe also vowed to end what he called a regime of cronyism, in which past governments would \u201cnegotiate with the rich, but not to the benefit of the poor.\u201dMr. Tsipras and Mr. Varoufakis plan to meet with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of European Union finance ministers, in Athens on Friday. This week, Mr. Dijsselbloem warned that there was \u201cvery little support for a write-off\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts. Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, is also scheduled to visit Mr. Tsipras this week in Athens.The market gyrations, driven by investors\u2019 bailing out of Greek assets, reflect fears over the coming showdown over Europe\u2019s austerity ideology. If Greece exited the eurozone and reintroduced the drachma currency \u2014 something Mr. Tsipras says he has no intention of bringing about \u2014 many of the Greek investments held by foreigners would plunge in value when the new currency was introduced at a sharp discount to the euro.Speculation is rife that capital flight has increased significantly since then. Greek officials said they did not immediately have new figures, and declined to comment on whether those emergency funds had been tapped.William Lelieveldt, a central bank spokesman, said only that \u201cwe don\u2019t provide real-time information on which kind of liquidity is requested or drawn.\u201dStill, the sell-off, while drastic, was not far out of line with the kind of volatility that has characterized the Athens financial markets since the onset of the country\u2019s crisis in 2010. Indeed, investors now tend to treat Greece more like a developing country than a member of the developed world. That volatility could die down as quickly as it arose should a suitable solution be found.The most likely outcome, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, is that \u201cfacing reality, Prime Minister Tsipras will eventually get real.\u201d\u201cA patient Europe will offer face-saving compromises,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Schmieding said in a research note, that in the meantime there could \u201cbe a rough ride for Greece.\u201d And he warned that the odds of an \u201caccidental\u201d Greek exit from the eurozone, at 35 percent, were not insignificant.Adding to the uncertainty was a report that Mr. Tsipras had basically frozen Greece\u2019s privatization program, which had been a central demand of creditors in approving the country\u2019s international bailouts. The troika had expected Greece to raise tens of billions of euros to pay its debts by privatizing state assets.But the country\u2019s new energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, told Greek television that the government was immediately halting plans to privatize a public power company. It was also delaying the sale of a portion of Piraeus Port, one of the most strategically placed in the Mediterranean, to the Chinese state-owned company Cosco, which already owns half of Piraeus and had recently signed an agreement to start expanding cargo capacity on the other half of the port.Mr. Tsipras said he was well aware of the high expectations for him in Greece, and the heavy responsibility his government shouldered. He suggested that the rousing messages of support he had received from leaders in numerous countries, from Russia to France to Spain, signaled that compromise was possible.\u201cThe country is lifting up its head, assuming global significance, attracting international interest,\u201d he added. \u201cGreece is regaining its self-confidence and building alliances that will allow it to set its own agenda at the European table.\u201d\u201cWe have no time to delay,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no room for mistakes.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day the interest rate on Greek 10-year government bonds increased nearly 1 percent.

{"Headline": "Obama Is Planning New Rules on Oil and Gas Industry\u2019s Methane Emissions", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEnvironmental advocates have long urged the Obama administration to target methane emissions, and the rules would be the first to do so. Most of the planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution in the United States comes from carbon dioxide, which is produced by burning coal, oil and natural gas. Methane, which leaks from oil and gas wells, accounts for just 9 percent of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution \u2014 but it is over 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, so even small amounts of it can have a big impact on global warming.\u201cThis is the biggest opportunity to curb climate change pollution that they haven\u2019t already seized,\u201d said David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.The oil and gas industry has pushed back against methane regulations, insisting that new rules could stymie a booming industry and that voluntary industrywide standards are sufficient to prevent methane leaks.\u201cE.P.A.\u2019s proposed methane regulation is redundant, costly, and unnecessary,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group for the fossil fuel industry. \u201cEnergy producers are already reducing methane emissions because methane is a valuable commodity. It would be like issuing regulations forcing ice cream makers to spill less ice cream.\u201dMethane is a major component of natural gas, and oil and gas companies say they are motivated to prevent leaks of the product that they sell.\u201cWe want to bring it to market,\u201d said Howard Feldman, director of regulatory affairs for the American Petroleum Institute. \u201cWe don\u2019t think additional regulation is needed at this time.\u201dBoth sides said that the stringency, cost and effectiveness of the rules would be revealed this summer.The new rules are part of Mr. Obama\u2019s push for regulations designed to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from different sectors of the economy. The White House says it can make the moves under the Clean Air Act, rather than by trying to push legislation through the Republican-controlled congress.In November, in a joint agreement with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Obama pledged that the United States would cut greenhouse gas pollution by up to 28 percent by 2025. That deal came on top of a 2009 United Nations accord in which Mr. Obama pledged to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 from their 2005 levels.Neither of those goals can be achieved without new climate change legislation or a suite of new regulations aimed at slashing greenhouse gases from different sectors of the economy, according to most climate policy experts.Mr. Obama issued rules in his first term to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide from cars and trucks. Last year, he proposed regulations on carbon dioxide from power plants.Mr. Obama\u2019s new regulations will be designed to curb methane leaks from oil and gas wells, pipelines and valves \u2014 the entire fossil fuel drilling, production and transportation system.Initially, they will apply only to new and modified oil and gas systems.That falls short of what environmentalists have called for; they have demanded that the rules regulate existing oil and gas facilities. White House officials said Wednesday that they will work with the oil and gas industry to develop voluntary methane reduction standards for existing facilities.\u201cAlthough these new rules are a welcome step in the right direction, they only govern new sources of methane pollution,\u201d said Jennifer Krill, director of Earthworks, an environmental group. \u201cGlobal warming doesn\u2019t care if a greenhouse gas source is new or old, and neither should these rules. Meaningful reductions in methane pollution from existing sources cannot be tackled by voluntary measures,\u201d she said.Under the Clean Air Act, the creation of E.P.A. standards to regulate pollution from future facilities triggers a legal requirement that the agency develop standards to develop rules on existing facilities. The law offers no time frame for doing that, however.A senior E.P.A. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that methane rules for existing sources could come \u201cin a future administration.\u201dThe Interior Department is also expected to propose standards this spring that would reduce methane leaks from oil and gas wells on federal land.The methane announcement will coincide with a series of climate change moves from the administration this summer. The E.P.A. has said that it will also release final regulations on power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scott Walker, Starting Second Term as Wisconsin Governor, Resists New Union Battle", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who rose to national prominence in the Republican Party by cutting the collective bargaining rights of most public sector unions, strongly indicated in the final days of his re-election campaign that he had no plans to expand the battle with labor unions that defined his first term.On Monday, as he was inaugurated for a second term, Mr. Walker spoke of improving education, shrinking the size and scope of government, and weeding out fraud and waste, but made no mention of \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation, which would outlaw labor contracts that require workers to pay union fees.Yet as Wisconsin\u2019s Legislature comes into session, with an expanded Republican majority, prominent members of Mr. Walker\u2019s party seem determined to take up the issue and resume the battle with labor, this time taking on private-sector unions. A group calling itself Wisconsin Right to Work has begun running radio ads here, and the state\u2019s largest business association, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, favors such a drive.Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader in the State Senate, said recently that he believed the Legislature could not avoid tackling the matter.\u201cIf there\u2019s a time to move on this, this is the time,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, who has been an ally of Mr. Walker\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see us going through this session without having this debate.\u201dThe passage of further legislation opposed by labor unions is not assured. Wisconsin went through turmoil, beginning four years ago, from demonstrations and various recall elections after Mr. Walker\u2019s fight with public-sector unions led to the limits on collective bargaining. The prospect is raising new tensions, even among some Republicans.For Mr. Walker, who is considered a potential candidate for president in 2016, the terrain is particularly complicated. His ability to survive a recall election catapulted him into favor with national Republican power brokers. But a resumption of battles with labor could pin him down and draw interest groups backed by Democrats into the fray against him.In recent weeks, Mr. Walker has said that he viewed the issue as a distraction from his focus on jobs and the state\u2019s economy, though he has not said whether he would sign or veto such a measure if it came to his desk.Some Democrats say that Mr. Walker, who helped sponsor a right-to-work bill as a member of the Assembly decades ago, is tacitly supportive of it now. Others view the situation as a sign of a serious rift within his party over a question that Mr. Walker might prefer not to address when he is seeking broad national appeal.\u201cLook, if the governor really doesn\u2019t want them to do this, it will not happen, period,\u201d said Peter Barca, the Democrats\u2019 leader in the Assembly, who described Mr. Walker\u2019s grip on the Republican caucus in the Legislature as firm. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be almost solely dependent on the governor. If the governor pumps the brakes, it will not go through. The governor will decide.\u201dAdvocates of right-to-work laws, who are pressing for similar legislation in other states and municipalities, say that the timing in Wisconsin is ideal, in part because this state\u2019s voters in November tightened the Republicans\u2019 hold on the state even after tumult over unions in a place with a rich labor history. But while Republicans hold an overwhelming majority in the Assembly, they have narrower control of the Senate.\u201cOur status as a non-right-to-work state is a competitive disadvantage,\u201d said Scott Manley, vice president of government relations at Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.Opponents of such a law say it would lead to lower wages and less say for workers. \u201cUp here we need to be focused on jobs, increased wages and family incomes \u2014 not going in the other direction,\u201d Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin A.F.L.-C.I.O., said.Under federal law, a union that negotiates a contract for employees can require those who choose not to be union members to still pay fees to cover the cost of being represented, unless a state or territory outlaws it.In Indiana, Mitch Daniels, a Republican who was then the governor, signed the legislation, though he had once said that he did not wish to add such a provision to the state\u2019s labor laws. In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed the bill, though he had previously said he did not consider it part of his agenda.On Monday, from the rotunda of a packed Statehouse \u2014 the same place where angry union supporters had filled the halls after Mr. Walker\u2019s collective bargaining cuts four years ago \u2014 the governor steered clear of the issue. In an inauguration that featured the children of elected leaders, including his two sons, Mr. Walker spoke in sweeping terms of smaller government, his record of tax cutting and an improving economy.\u201cIn Wisconsin, we understand that true freedom and prosperity do not come from the mighty hand of the government,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThey come from empowering people to control their own lives and their own destinies through the dignity that is born from work.\u201dIn what some saw as an early glimmer of a bid for national office, Mr. Walker characterized his state as a place of action in comparison with Capitol Hill. \u201cIn contrast to the politicians along the Potomac, we get things done here in the Badger State,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThere is a clear contrast between Washington and Wisconsin.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Dabbles in Reform", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 While North Korea draws world attention with spectacular and seemingly bizarre actions like the hacking of Sony\u2019s computers or outbursts of bellicose rhetoric, Pyongyang has quietly initiated a round of reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy. It\u2019s unlikely that Kim Jong-un, the young North Korean leader who inherited power in December 2011, will allow economic liberalization to lead the way for political and social change. The repressive regime will continue to be a thorn in the side of world leaders who want to dismantle Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. But the economic changes hold great promise for improving the lives of millions of North Koreans who have suffered in deep poverty for decades. The new policies should be welcomed and supported by the outside world.The impoverished countryside is the site of a major effort to open up the farming economy. My talks with North Korean refugees and migrant workers in China, as well as nongovernmental organization personnel on the ground, confirm what has been reported in South Korean media over the last few years: An agricultural system apparently implemented in 2013 allows farmers \u2014 who have always worked for a token payment and fixed rations \u2014 to register their households as \u201cwork teams.\u201d Such teams are now allowed to keep a larger portion of their harvest, some reports say more than 30 percent. Moreover, for the foreseeable future these family-based groups will toil in the same fields, year after year, giving them an incentive to take better care of the land. Before the change, farmers had worked on land that belonged to state-managed farms and were often moved from one field to another.A new set of market-oriented reforms adopted by the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party and by the cabinet of ministers on May 30, 2014, appears to aim to liberalize the economy as a whole. The content of this classified economic policy document was first partially leaked to the South Korean daily Segye Ilbo in June. Later it was confirmed by many sources and is now widely discussed by Pyongyang watchers. The \u201cMay 30 Measures,\u201d as they\u2019ve come to be known, envision the significant reduction of state control of the economy and a dismantling of central planning. Managers of state enterprises will be allowed to purchase items on a free market, making deals with other enterprises or even private businesses. They will be given the right to fire and hire workers, and pay them as much as they want. At coal mines near the border with China, where the new \u201csystem of managerial responsibility\u201d has been tested since late 2013, the best miners may now receive up to $70 a month, an exorbitant wage for the North. Mr. Kim has also left untouched the unofficial private economy, which began to grow in the 1990s and now contributes significantly to North Korea\u2019s tiny G.D.P., as much as 50 percent by some estimates. This economy of small businesses like food stalls, bicycle repair shops and truck deliveries, as well as larger ones like small coal mines and fishing companies, has never been explicitly accepted by the government. But since Mr. Kim\u2019s ascension, officials have left this gray market alone. The agricultural reforms are already bearing fruit. In 2013, the country enjoyed the best harvest in decades when \u2014 in a first since the 1980s \u2014 it produced nearly enough food to feed its population on a subsistence level. People on the ground are not surprised. Once farmers were turned from serfs to sharecroppers, the labor input increased dramatically, and it was enough to make a quick difference in an economy where wooden plows and oxen still reign supreme. The 2014 harvest was also impressive, in spite of severe drought. European workers from nongovernmental organizations and groups of visiting Chinese experts whom I recently met say that the efficiency of the farmers who now work for a share of crops, instead of fixed rations, increased dramatically. Indeed, as one migrant worker in China told me: \u201cFarmers take care of the fields, they now believe that the more they produce, the better they eat.\u201d The full impact of the reforms in industry will not be felt for a while, but it is likely to be strong: The Hyundai Research Institute even predicts that in 2015 North Korea\u2019s gross domestic product will increase 7 percent.From Mr. Kim\u2019s point of view, it makes sense to usher in economic changes: The old system was slowly falling apart, eroding from within by the development of an unofficial economy and growing disappointment in the official ideology. The reforms are risky, but without reforms the regime is certainly doomed.While the changes are positive for regular North Koreans, one should harbor no illusions: North Korea will remain a problematic place. The regime will never surrender its nuclear weapons. The leaders firmly believe that they need them as a diplomatic tool and as a deterrent, and their worries have not been ameliorated by the fate of Saddam Hussein and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the only dictator in history who swapped his nuclear weapons program for the promise of economic benefits from the West. North Korea will remain a human rights abuser. In China, economic reforms led to social liberalization; many Chinese can now do things that would have gotten them killed in the days of Mao. This is not going to happen in North Korea \u2014 because of South Korea. Thanks to strict information control in the North, rumors abound about the economic success of the South, but the true scope of that success remains unknown. If ordinary North Koreans were to become less fearful of the authorities, while also learning about the affluence of the South, they might do what the East Germans did: get rid of the regime and pave the way for a unified Korean Peninsula. From the regime\u2019s viewpoint, this means that only by keeping the populace terrified (but better fed) do they have some chance of maintaining authority. Nevertheless, a reforming North Korea will be an unstable place, with the specter of implosion always looming. The regime\u2019s implosion could mean a civil war in a nuclear state in a region where interests of the United States and China clash. Still, a prospering North Korea will be less inclined to deliberately destabilize the environment: Its leaders will need stability in their neighborhood to make money. Even if North Korea remains repressive, the lives of citizens will improve. And few people would argue that living in a starving dictatorship is better than living in a modestly affluent one.

{"Headline": "Uneven Progress for 3 Chicagoans Janet Yellen Held Up as Symbols", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In her first speech as Federal Reserve chairwoman last March, Janet L. Yellen told the stories of three Chicago residents struggling to recover from the recession to explain why she intended for the Fed to retreat slowly from its stimulus campaign.Jermaine Brownlee, 40, has found full-time work building bus seats, although he makes a third less than he did in his old job building houses. \u201cI\u2019m back full time, and I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m employed,\u201d Mr. Brownlee said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s just that before I had the job I was saying, \u2018If I could just have a job. ...\u2019 And now that I have the job, I\u2019m saying, \u2018If it could pay me just a little bit more money. ...\u2019\u00a0\u201dAs Ms. Yellen and her colleagues convene Tuesday and Wednesday for their first policy meeting of 2015, the stories of the three workers highlight the economy\u2019s progress under the Fed\u2019s patient care, but also the reality that the recovery remains incomplete. The Fed has signaled that it would like to start raising its benchmark interest rate around midyear. Analysts expect the Fed to strengthen that signal Wednesday.The economic expansion has accelerated with each passing year, and the decline in unemployment is outstripping the Fed\u2019s expectations.But the sluggish pace of inflation, and of wage growth, is weighing on those plans. The slow increases in prices and wages, if they continue, would mean that the Fed has yet to accomplish its own goals.In the face of that reality, Fed officials increasingly are emphasizing that raising the benchmark rate above zero for the first time since December 2008 will not be the end of the stimulus campaign. Officials say that they plan to raise rates slowly, as conditions improve, and that rates will remain unusually low for years.The share of the American population that is middle income has been shrinking for several decades. Until fairly recently, that was because more people were entering a higher-income bracket. Now it\u2019s for the opposite reason.When Dorine Poole spoke with Ms. Yellen last year, she was working 30 hours a week as an office manager for UrbanPonics, a company created to grow lettuce in an old industrial building. She has two children, cares for her mother and was making $14,000 a year.Then, in June, the company closed \u2014 but Ms. Poole did not miss a single day of work. She was hired immediately as a full-time office manager by New Covenant Community Development Corporation, another postrecession start-up formed to encourage small business creation in the North Lawndale neighborhood where she lives.She now makes almost $20,000 a year \u2014 closer to the $32,000 she made as an insurance claims processor before the recession.\u201cI caught a great break,\u201d Ms. Poole, 39, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real step up.\u201dMr. Brownlee also has moved on, and up, from the job he held when he met Ms. Yellen last year. At the time, he was working for a nonprofit agency that offers short-term employment as part of a job-training and rehabilitation program for people convicted of crimes. In June, he completed the program and found work through a temporary agency at Freedman Seating, a Chicago company that makes bus and train seats. A few months later, the company hired him full time.But Mr. Brownlee, like Ms. Poole, is still making less money than he did before the recession. A Chicago native, he moved to Texas in 2001 and found steady construction work around Austin, earning about $12 an hour, plus all the overtime he wanted.He lost that job in 2008 when construction work dried up, and returned to Chicago to be closer to his family. He worked odd jobs, when he could find work at all. In 2013 he was convicted of heroin possession and spent time in jail. Now he earns $8.25 an hour. His fianc\u00e9e works, too, and, together, they are eking out a living for themselves and his daughter. What would he tell Ms. Yellen if she called again?\u201cI appreciate what she\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. Brownlee said. \u201cAnd I would just edge them on to continue pushing until we can get where we\u2019re striving to be, that wages are compensatable for the cost of living.\u201dThe unemployment rate, which fell to 5.6 percent in December, is approaching its prerecession level of about 5 percent, but there is little evidence employers are competing for workers by raising wages. Some Federal Reserve officials have begun to caution that they are not ready to raise interest rates until wage and price inflation strengthens.The story of the third Chicago worker, however, highlights the limits of the Fed\u2019s ability to improve the fortunes of American workers by means of its primary tool: holding down borrowing costs.Almost a year later, Ms. Lira is still serving food samples two days a week, six hours a day, at the same Mariano\u2019s supermarket in Chicago. She still wishes she had three more workdays each week.The problem: When Ms. Lira lost work in 2007, she owed about $1,200 to the electronics retailer Best Buy and the department store Carson Pirie Scott. Those bills, with interest, now total $3,700. She said she was not making payments on her debt.Ms. Lira said she had been advised that if she worked more hours and earned more money, the companies she owed would seek to garnish her wages. She said she would like to file for bankruptcy, but could not afford a lawyer to help her navigate the process.As a result, when Mariano\u2019s offered her full-time work last summer, she declined. Still, Ms. Lira said she considered herself lucky. She was homeless for three years. Now she lives in public housing.\u201cWhen I walk home from Mariano\u2019s to catch the Clark Street bus, I see five people homeless in this freezing weather, and it kills me,\u201d Ms. Lira said. \u201cI wish I made enough money to help them.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jorge Ramos, Voice of Latino Voters on Univision, Sends Shiver Through G.O.P.", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDORAL, Fla. \u2014 Jorge Ramos, the Univision and Fusion television anchor who is often called the Walter Cronkite of Latino America, was in his suburban Miami broadcast studio when he all but pounced on the chairman of the Republican Party, Reince Priebus, who was appearing from Washington. The Republicans\u2019 immigration policy is \u201cdeportations, deportations, deportations,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cWhy?\u201dMr. Priebus, who stared out from multiple screens in a control room here looking as if he would rather have been doing anything but talking to Mr. Ramos, insisted it was not so. But Mr. Ramos would not have it.\u201cThe message,\u201d he retorted, \u201cis anti-immigrant.\u201dFor years, Mr. Ramos largely aimed his ire at President Obama for breaking his 2008 campaign promise \u2014 made directly to Mr. Ramos \u2014 that he would propose an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system in his first year in office, and for deporting two million people since. Even after Mr. Obama announced late last year that nearly half of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants could apply to work without fear of deportation, Mr. Ramos confronted him during a Nashville forum for having \u201cdestroyed many families\u201d by not acting sooner.But Mr. Ramos\u2019s focus has changed, he said in an interview here: \u201cNow is the turn of Republicans.\u201dThis weekend, the Spanish-language Univision, and Fusion, its English-language venture with ABC News, will cover the first gathering of 2016 Republican presidential aspirants, at a conservative forum in Des Moines on Saturday organized by Representative Steve King of Iowa. Mr. King, an immigration hard-liner, is well known to Latinos for remarks like one claiming that most young border-crossers have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana.\u201dThat coverage follows Mr. Ramos\u2019s in-depth reporting last week of House Republicans\u2019 vote to block Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration orders and deport up to four million people, mainly so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children and the parents of American citizens. Given Republicans\u2019 immigration stance, Mr. Ramos expects to cover more such stories through 2016.And that has some Republicans worried.\u201cRemember what L.B.J. said, \u2018When you lose Walter Cronkite, you\u2019ve lost the war\u2019?\u201d said Matthew Dowd, a campaign adviser to George W. Bush, recalling the oft-cited if disputed story that President Lyndon B. Johnson said he lost \u201cmiddle America\u201d when Cronkite turned against the Vietnam War. Among Latino voters, Mr. Ramos has the sort of influence and audience that Cronkite had more broadly among Americans in his day.Mr. Ramos is \u201cnot only a journalist, he\u2019s become the voice of the Latino constituency,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where Republicans have to worry \u2014 you don\u2019t want to lose Jorge Ramos.\u201dHow Republicans are perceived among Latinos mattered little in the midterm elections last year, when the party won control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. Turnout of Latinos and other minority voters was, as usual, much lower than for presidential elections, and most close contests were in places with few Latinos.But in 2016, the Republican record will matter. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who said during the campaign that undocumented residents should \u201cself-deport\u201d \u2014 a position he defended in an interview last November on Univision \u2014 got only 27 percent of Latinos\u2019 votes. Republican strategists say their 2016 nominee must get more than 40 percent to win. The last Republican candidate to do so was Mr. Bush, who had supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.Early signs in both the Republican-run Congress and the presidential nomination race suggest how far Republicans have veered from the immigration course recommended two years ago when the party, at Mr. Priebus\u2019s direction, produced an autopsy of Republicans\u2019 2012 losses that concluded that they must do more to engage Latino voters and propose \u201cpositive solutions on immigration.\u201dRepublicans \u201cshould pay a lot of attention\u201d to Mr. Ramos, said Carlos M. Gutierrez, a commerce secretary to Mr. Bush. \u201cWhen Steve King made that terrible comment about kids with legs the size of cantaloupes, that was on Spanish-language TV the same day,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez recalled.But Sean Spicer, communications director for the Republican Party, suggested that because Mr. Ramos had become such an activist on immigration policy, \u201che\u2019s now taken with a grain of salt.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no question that he\u2019s important and that he has a lot of influence, but I think that people now have sort of recognized that he\u2019s more of an advocate than a journalist,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.He echoed a point that Mr. Romney made in November to Mr. Ramos\u2019s co-anchor at Univision, Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas: Latino voters care as much or more about education, health care, jobs and the economy as they do about immigration.\u201cWhat\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, \u201cis that Jorge doesn\u2019t want to have that conversation.\u201dMr. Ramos disputed that he was interested only in immigration and cited the range of issues he covers on the nightly news program \u201cNoticiero Univision\u201d; his Sunday show, \u201cAl Punto\u201d; and his weekly program on Fusion for young Latinos and other millennials, \u201cAmerica With Jorge Ramos.\u201d He said that for Latinos, \u201cjust like for the rest of America,\u201d the economy and education were the most important issues.\u201cBut immigration is personal,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is the issue that tells us who is with us and who is against us; there\u2019s no question about it. And it\u2019s very simple to understand why \u2014 half of all Latinos over 18 years of age were born outside the United States. It really makes no sense to attack them and criticize them if you want their vote.\u201dThe issue is also personal for Mr. Ramos, 56, who has the smooth, silver-haired look of a classic television anchor. Born in Mexico City, he came to the United States as a young journalist, and by 28 he was an anchor for Univision. In 2008, he became an American citizen. Univision is a media goliath, but with the 2013 debut of Fusion in English, Mr. Ramos\u2019s reach expanded significantly, and with it the attention of American politicians.Both parties now view him with trepidation. Last summer, after Speaker John A. Boehner spurned his interview requests, Mr. Ramos traveled to Capitol Hill and asked the speaker at a news conference about why he would not allow the House to vote on a bipartisan, Senate-passed immigration bill.Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois, said he told Mr. Obama when the two flew to Las Vegas for the president\u2019s announcement of his immigration orders that Mr. Ramos, on the air, had called it the most significant action for Hispanics in 50 years. \u201cHe said that?\u201d Mr. Obama replied, according to Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez. But Mr. Ramos had no such praise when he later interviewed the president in Nashville, only questions about why Mr. Obama had long said he lacked the power to act.That interrogation, like some of Mr. Ramos\u2019s five others with Mr. Obama, drew approving attention on Fox News. Sean Hannity and Bill O\u2019Reilly both had him on their shows afterward.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID POSTCRUISING TOWARDS ZEROCAN WE ELIMINATE AUTO-ACCIDENT FATALITIES?Note: Crash scenes simulated for illustration purposes. As safety technology gets smarter, vehicles are getting better at avoiding crashes before they happen and minimizing harm when they do. The goal of eliminating accident deaths \u2014 once thought impossible \u2014 could be in sight. Note: Crash scenes simulated for illustration purposes. Elizabeth Malsin has good reason to be passionate about the goal of zero car fatalities.  In 2004, the real estate developer was driving her Volvo Cross Country station wagon over a bridge in Portland, Oregon, when the driver of an S.U.V. lost control and hit her head on.  \u201cAll the airbags went off, and the seatbelts held me in,\u201d recalls Malsin. \u201cIn another car, I easily could have died. Now I feel really good about having bought a safe vehicle, and about being around to see my little boy grow up.\u201d  Malsin\u2019s experience is far from unique. Per mile driven, fewer passengers are dying on U.S. roads than ever before.  Between 1954 and 2013, vehicle miles traveled in the United States \u2014 a statistical estimate of the total distance covered by all the nation\u2019s vehicles \u2014 grew roughly sixfold. Yet over that same 59-year span, the number of auto-related deaths actually fell slightly, from 33,890 to 32,850. Deaths per motor vehicle crash have fallen as well, by about half since 1975, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  \u201cProgressively more stringent crash-safety standards, beginning in the late 1960s, have done wonders to protect occupants in vehicles of all types and sizes\u201d in both single- and multi-vehicle accidents, says Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst at Navigant Research.  Changes on a variety of fronts have combined to improve auto safety. Over decades, better road design has improved intersections, on ramps, off ramps and other infrastructure. But a big share of these safety gains can be credited to the advanced materials and technologies being built into cars.  New vehicles carry a dazzling array of both active and passive safety systems. From multiple airbags to adaptive cruise control, collision warning systems and lane-keeping assistance, modern cars are designed to be on the alert for danger and react instantly when it occurs.  Reinventing the way a car is built is devilishly complex. Engineers must balance conflicting goals, such as adding strength to improve safety while cutting weight to boost fuel economy.  To accomplish both, engineers across the industry are turning to once-exotic materials, including tough-but-light carbon fiber, aluminum and ultra-high-strength steel. These advanced materials \u201cmaintain the passenger compartment while dissipating crash energy,\u201d Abuelsamid says. Meanwhile, airbags and seat belts have \u201chelped to keep occupants in the vehicle, where crash structures can provide the best protection.\u201d  At Volvo, ultra-high-strength steel \u2014 the strongest used in the car-body industry \u2014 is the material of choice. The 2016 XC90, a seven-seat S.U.V., uses about five times more of the metal than the first-generation XC90 did. And a uniquely designed passenger cage absorbs energy upon impact while maintaining its structure, which protects occupants.  Volvo\u2019s efforts to protect passengers go beyond what regulators require for five-star safety ratings. Its Accident Research Database, a trove of accident-analysis findings the company has been building for more than 45 years, provides real-world insights to guide those efforts. The database now includes information on 40,000 crashes in Volvos, involving 60,000 occupants.  Like other carmakers, Volvo also studies U.S. NHTSA test standards. But its focus on real-world data helps push the company\u2019s safety goals further, says Magdalena Lindman, a Volvo technical expert for traffic-safety data analysis. \u201cWe do our own in-depth analysis of these accidents,\u201d Lindman adds. \u201cIf we have knowledge of the past, it\u2019s easier to predict the future.\u201d  Sleep-deprived drivers pose an all-too-common danger. A National Sleep Foundation poll found that a third of adult drivers \u2014 more than 100 million people \u2014 have dozed off while behind the wheel. And one in six deadly accidents involves drowsy driving, according to the American Automobile Association  Technology can\u2019t yet keep you from falling asleep, but it can step in to lower the risk. And if you do doze off, it can soften the consequences.  Volvo\u2019s 2016 XC90 has a feature called Driver Alert Control, which uses pattern-recognition software \u2014 monitoring the car\u2019s progress between lane markings \u2014 to notify the driver if his or her driving pattern is erratic. When triggered, the system sounds an alert and displays a dashboard message recommending that the driver take a break. Using GPS, Rest Stop Guidance directs the driver to the nearest place to pull over.  The car is also designed to intervene to prevent accidents. To lower the risk posed by an inattentive or sleepy driver in your rearview mirror, radar scans for possible rear-end impacts. If necessary, the car flashes warning lights at the driver behind you. If the system senses that a collision is imminent, it tightens the safety belts and hits the brakes to minimize harm.  Other big auto makers are on a similar route, exploring features like lane-deviation monitoring and pre-collision warnings.  For drivers, policymakers and the public, the next frontier in automotive safety is lowering the risk to those outside the car. While auto-accident fatalities have been declining in the U.S., pedestrian deaths are going up. In 2012 (the most recent data available), 4,743 pedestrians were killed by cars, according to NHTSA.  To address this, the Volvo XC90\u2019s City Safety system uses a mix of forward-looking cameras and radar to I.D. vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists and applies the brakes if it senses that a crash could occur. The system also reduces the risk of turning into the path of an oncoming vehicle.  In the event of an impact, there are ways to mitigate harm to a pedestrian. Volvo was the first carmaker to introduce an external airbag in the V40 and V40 Cross Country (vehicles not sold in the U.S.) to help protect pedestrians. In a collision, sensors trigger an outside airbag that\u2019s mounted near the windshield to cushion the blow if, as sometimes happens, a pedestrian is thrown onto the hood and into the windshield. The system also raises the rear of the hood four inches, giving the metal more depth to dent, thereby absorbing more of the pedestrian\u2019s impact.  The pedestrian airbag technology was specifically developed by Volvo for a smaller vehicle with a low stance and short hood. Larger vehicles have a different stance and geometry enabling collisions with pedestrians to be mitigated in other ways.  In Europe, region-wide regulations have ensured wide adoption of these pedestrian-protection systems, and U.S. auto makers are moving in that direction as well. Other big auto makers have debuted pedestrian-safety systems and the pace will quicken further if, as some expect, NHTSA follows through with federal regulations requiring them.  In\u00a0an increasingly connected society, our vehicles have become places where drivers want to stay linked to the wider world. But that desire can pull focus from the task at hand: driving. So manufacturers are looking for ways to minimize the distraction factor.  Volvo approached this challenge by studying the in-car habits of drivers, with a special focus on the touchscreen, which is quickly becoming the most widely-adopted user interface.  By developing a familiar, intuitive interface, enhanced by voice interaction, Volvo aims to strike a just-right balance by offering a simple, nondistracting way to access the most relevant apps \u2014 navigation, music and other streaming media. This upgraded interface is new in the 2016 XC90. If you look at world traffic fatalities worldwide, it\u2019s about 1.2 \u2013 1.3 million people getting killed each year,\u201d says Thomas Broberg a senior technical advisor for safety at Volvo. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a problem\u2026 it\u2019s epidemic.\u201dCrash test dummies line the walls at Volvo\u2019s Safety Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. At Volvo, ultra-high-strength steel \u2014 the strongest used in the car-body industry \u2014 helps protect passengers while keeping vehicle weight down. The 2016 XC90 uses about five times more of the material than did its first-generation predecessor. The view from the backseat of a recently crash-tested 2016 XC90.

While at the crash site, team members gather photographs and data. Knowledge drawn from real-world collisions is crucial to Volvo\u2019s safety R&D process, says Broberg.

{"Headline": "In China, Projects to Make Great Wall Feel Small ", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBridge-building is akin to an Olympic event in China. The Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, which cost $2.3 billion, is the world\u2019s longest sea-crossing bridge.DALIAN, China \u2014 The plan here seems far-fetched \u2014 a $36 billion tunnel that would run twice the length of the one under the English Channel, and bore deep into one of Asia\u2019s active earthquake zones. When completed, it would be the world\u2019s longest underwater tunnel, creating a rail link between two northern port cities.Throughout China, equally ambitious projects with multibillion-dollar price tags are already underway. The world\u2019s largest bridge. The biggest airport. The longest gas pipeline. An $80 billion effort to divert water from the south of the country, where it is abundant, to a parched section of the north, along a route that covers more than 1,500 miles.Such enormous infrastructure projects are a Chinese tradition. From the Great Wall to the Grand Canal and the Three Gorges Dam, this nation for centuries has used colossal public-works projects to showcase its engineering prowess and project its economic might.\u201cChina has always had this history of mega-projects,\u201d said Huang Yukon, an economist and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank based in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the blood, the culture, the nature of its society. To have an impact on the country, they\u2019ve got to be big.\u201dWhether China really needs this much big infrastructure \u2014 or can even afford it \u2014 is a contentious issue.The infrastructure plans run counter to Beijing\u2019s commitment to reduce its heavy reliance on government-led investment to fuel growth. And some economists worry that the country might eventually be mired in enormous debt.According to China\u2019s National Audit Office, local government debt alone stood at about $3.1 trillion in 2013, more than a third the size of the entire economy. The high level of debt, analysts warn, could stunt growth for a long time.\u201cPeople should be concerned because very few of these big projects generate cash,\u201d said Victor Shih, a China specialist who teaches political economy at the University of California, San Diego.And yet China\u2019s leaders are so confident of the value and necessity of building on an epic scale that engineers are mapping out plans for decades to come.Shanghai is considered a model, a spectacularly rich metropolis of 25 million residents. Undergirding the city is a patchwork of supersize infrastructure \u2014 huge airports, subway lines, sewage systems and power plants.In the city\u2019s thriving financial center, workers are putting finishing touches on the Shanghai Tower, a $2.4 billion cloud-piercer that at 2,073 feet is the world\u2019s second-tallest building. Only the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is taller, at 2,716 feet.Further east, the city is building the world\u2019s largest playground, Shanghai Disney Resort, which when it opens around 2016 will be surrounded by a 225-acre Magic Kingdom-style park, a development expected to cost more than $5 billion. A city-owned company is helping finance the project.Shanghai can afford the huge price tags. The fast-growing city is a financial center and a major tourist destination.But other cities don\u2019t necessarily have the means to pay for such huge infrastructure projects.In Tianjin, about 70 miles southeast of Beijing, the city has borrowed heavily to create what some have called a replica of New York City, with complexes modeled after Rockefeller Center and Lincoln Center. Today, though, the area is a virtual ghost town. Dozens of office towers and luxury developments sit empty, half-completed.And here in Dalian, a city of six million in the northeast, the proposed underwater rail tunnel to Yantai is just one piece of a master plan that includes a 163-mile urban transit system. Work is also underway on what the city says will be the world\u2019s largest offshore airport, a $4.3 billion development on an artificial island created with landfill, covering more than eight square miles.\u201cIt makes sense to accelerate infrastructure spending during a downturn, when capital and labor are underemployed,\u201d said David Dollar, the former country director in China for the World Bank and now at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But \u201cif the growth rate is propped up through building unnecessary infrastructure, eventually there could be a sharp slowdown that reveals that the infrastructure was really not needed at all.\u201dMany experts say such projects also exact a heavy toll on local communities and the environment, as builders displace people, clear forests, reroute rivers and erect dams.In the northwest, in the city of Lanzhou, the local government has backed plans to flatten the tops of 700 low-level mountains to make way for a new business district, despite concerns about the damage to the local ecosystem. Dam-building has also wreaked havoc, creating water shortages and environmental damage and it may have even helped set off earthquakes in southwest China, according to some scientists.\u201cThe perilous path is the notion you can control nature,\u201d said Paul K. Gellert, a sociologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. \u201cThere will always be negative social and environmental consequences.\u201dAs a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party, China can easily muster the political will and financial resources to undertake such huge projects. And for now, it is backing \u2014 and even encouraging \u2014 municipalities to think big.\u201cThey have an authoritarian system. And so they can do all this without opposition \u2014 this is key,\u201d said Gerardo del Cerro Santamar\u00eda, an expert on mega-projects at Cooper Union in New York. \u201cIn the West, civil society participates, and in many cases, opposes big projects.\u201dOther huge projects could bolster China\u2019s position as a manufacturing and trading powerhouse. In November, the government said its freight rail link between eastern China and Spain had opened, allowing factory goods to reach Spain in just over 20 days. It is now the world\u2019s longest rail journey, far surpassing the route of the famed Trans-Siberian Railway.China also sees hidden benefits in such projects, including the ability to gain new scientific and technical expertise.As a result, bridge-building in China has become something akin to an Olympic event. In 2007, after China completed the longest sea-crossing bridge, in Hangzhou, the nation has regularly broken records. China now claims the longest bridge of any kind, the highest bridge and, in 2011, a new successor to the longest sea-crossing bridge, 26.4 miles long, in the eastern city of Qingdao.\u201cFor China, a lot of this is about building a national identity. Mega-projects are suited for that,\u201d said Bent Flyvbjerg, an authority on mega-projects who teaches at Oxford University. \u201cIt\u2019s a lighthouse for all to see what the Chinese nation can do.\u201dIt is the type of engineering expertise the government wants its state-owned enterprises to export \u2014 and that is already happening. Boston is buying subway cars from China. Argentina, Pakistan and Russia have asked China to upgrade their infrastructure. Last month, Chinese construction teams began work on an ambitious $50 billion canal across Nicaragua that could some day rival the Panama Canal.\u201cThey have the idea that they\u2019re going to be doing infrastructure for the rest of the world,\u201d said Mr. Huang at the Carnegie Institute.In doing so, China is pushing the boundaries of infrastructure-building, with ever bolder proposals. The Dalian tunnel looks small compared with the latest idea to build an \u201cinternational railway\u201d that would link China to the United States by burrowing under the Bering Strait and creating a tunnel between Russia and Alaska.\u201cThe technology is already there,\u201d said Wang Mengshu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and an adviser on the Dalian tunnel proposal. \u201cThink about it. If we can build a railway to the North Pole, it would be convenient for us to go to the North Pole.\u201dPhoebe Peng contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Far-Flung Myanmar, a Land of Contradictions", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is strange how some of the world\u2019s most retrograde authoritarian states end up being such inadvertent conservators of both their country\u2019s architectural heritage and vast tracts of wild, unspoiled nature. Of course, it was not their leaders\u2019 intention to distinguish themselves as environmentalists or conservationists, but by so abjectly failing to develop viable economic engines, they nonetheless had this providential effect.The still-pristine beaches and undisturbed colonial architecture in Cuba that the Castro dynasty froze in amber for so many decades and the smog-free and tourist-less cities and untouched coastlines and mountains in North Korea that the Kim dynasty so effectively kept unvisited by industry and tourism are two such examples.But laurels must also go to Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country that languished after a military junta took power in 1988 and overturned a democratic election. It was the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, that put the dissident Daw Aung San Suu Kyi under long-term house arrest and changed the country\u2019s name from Burma to Myanmar and the capital\u2019s name from Rangoon to Yangon.Then, to top off the political re-engineering efforts, the country built an entirely new multibillion-dollar national capital at Naypyidaw in the middle of the jungle, a city that even to this day is so bereft of human life that it gives the impression of having been neutron-bombed. But Naypyidaw is hardly the \u201creal\u201d Myanmar that lives in the largely rural, ethnically varied, culturally diverse and geographically divided hinterland beyond.Traveling this fascinating and contradictory land today, one must acknowledge a certain debt of gratitude to those generals who helped keep it in a state of penurious, suspended animation while most of the rest of Asia was incinerating itself in orgies of high-speed economic growth and environmental despoliation. By not providing much for them to consume, the generals also managed to protect their largely good-hearted and devoutly Buddhist people from the predations of rampant consumer culture. It was, of course, a bittersweet triumph.Such ironies were swirling around my head as the Asian Wings prop plane that my friends and I were on set down last month at Putao\u2019s tiny airport in the northernmost part of Myanmar, where a protrusion of the Kachin State juts up toward Tibet between the Yunnan Province in China and Arunachal Pradesh, a state in India.The most distinguishing features of this far-flung part of Myanmar are its remoteness and the fact that it boasts the country\u2019s share of the Greater Himalayas, that magnificent range of towering peaks that arcs up over the top of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from China to Afghanistan. That Kachin possesses Southeast Asia\u2019s tallest summit, Hkakabo Razi (19,296 feet), and one of Myanmar\u2019s largest national parks is a source of pride. But so remote is this area that even the Japanese Imperial Army never managed to wrest it from British control during World War II. And outside Putao, you can still see the remains of Fort Hertz, one of the most far-off outposts of the British colonial army\u2019s Burma Frontier Force.Walking down a steep, rocky trail under a jungle canopy of vines, banana trees, hardwoods and bamboo, where some of the most exotic orchids in the world still thrive, I suddenly got a fleeting view of the emerald Nam Lang River below. This beautiful river on which we were about to raft surges down from the Himalayas through rocky canyons and vast tracts of dense, virgin subtropical jungle to finally merge with the mighty Irrawaddy River, the main aorta irrigating this verdant land.These headwaters comprise one of the last large and mostly undisturbed ecosystems in Asia, one of the few places in the region that Google Maps still shows as cartographic blankness \u2014 a roadless, damless, townless expanse of forested mountains.Once in a raft and coursing down this sylvan river, I was overcome with a feeling of exhilaration at being in a place where there are so few other people, the water is still so pure, and the natural landscape is still so breathtakingly unperturbed. The only signs of human intrusion were the occasional lean-to and small bamboo raft on the rocky shore that are used by local fishermen. Nowhere to be seen were the effluvia of discarded plastic bags, bottles, wrappers and other detritus that, along with polluted water, have become the hallmarks of most other Asian rivers and lakes.But, even as I marveled at the beauty of it all, a reaction kicked in that for many of us has become almost autonomic each time we encounter a scene of unalloyed natural beauty in our modern world: Suddenly an unwelcome sense of the scene\u2019s fragility jolts us with feelings of apprehension about its future. Now that Myanmar is finally \u201copening up,\u201d foreign investment is flooding in, and tourism is burgeoning, we are left to worry about how long it will be before our own rapacious, Promethean instinct to exploit, develop and enrich becomes the undoing of even these last out-of-the-way and hard-to-reach backwaters of the world. (Commercial flights to Putao are still seasonal, and because its airport has no refueling capability, aircraft must stop on the way from Yangon at Mandalay or Myitkyina.) It is a seemingly inescapable and bitter reality that, for the remaining remote and wild places still left in the world, discovery and access are almost inevitably a prelude to exploitation, if not desecration.The Putao region was originally populated by only a few indigenous tribal people. However, in 1949, as Mao began taking over China, the American missionary J. Russell Morse was forced to leave Yunnan Province and seek refuge across the border in Burma, then still a British colony. Leading several thousands of his Church of Christ Lisu parishioners, he trekked to this Kachin valley and established a new church and mission compound on the banks of the Nam Lang River in Mulashidi. (Although Morse is long gone, one can still walk through the collapsing ruins of his lovely old mission and even attend one of the still active churches he spawned that continue to serve the many Christian members of the Putao community.)As the Nam Lang River approaches the flat Putao plain, it broadens out, and there perched high on a rocky bluff are the thatch-roof bungalows of the Malikha Lodge. Shrouded by bamboo groves, a teakwood veranda in front of the main building juts out like the foredeck of an old sailing ship that seems to be beating straight up the river toward the sweeping panorama of the snow-capped peaks in the Khamti Mountains, on Myanmar\u2019s border with northeastern India.That such a beautifully appointed auberge \u2014 designed by the Belgian-born, Kuala Lumpur-based resort designer Jean-Michel Gathy, of Aman Resorts fame \u2014 is here at all is a wonder, as is the fact that, after being dunked in the chilly river while rafting, guests will arrive back at their bungalows to find their private teak hot tubs filled with hot water and flower petals by the cheerful staff. That all this tastefulness and refinement has managed to materialize in one of the remotest parts of this long-isolated country, even as it struggles with poverty, separatism, poor infrastructure and opium production, seems a miracle.Beautifully constructed out of local hardwood and roofed with traditional palm frond thatching, each of the lodge\u2019s 12 private \u201cbungalows\u201d is equipped with its own espresso maker, hot tub, wood-burning stove and outdoor terrace. The lodge is open for business from October (when the seasonal monsoon ceases and the weather begins cooling to provide welcome natural relief from heat and mosquitoes in these malarial climes) through April (when the rains resume, temperatures rise, bugs proliferate and the surrounding jungles become a high-humidity tropical pressure cooker).Because most of the region still lives in a pre-electrical age, the lodge is powered by its own generator, and when the power goes off each night, the darkness feels primal. Indeed, without all of the light pollution to which our urban eyes have become accustomed, the stars overhead shine with such dazzling brilliance that they seem almost unnatural, even psychedelic.Here, local people tend to retire and rise with the sun. Each new day is announced not by cellphones, clock radios or the beeping of other digital devices, but by the first insomniac rooster\u2019s prelight reveille, a clarion call that quickly triggers a wrap-around sonic cacophony, as every other backsliding rooster in the neighborhood joins in to herald the dawn. Then from across the river, where rice paddies step down to the shore, come the sounds of crying babies, laughing children and the chopping of wood. Only then does the sky begin to brighten and smoke begin to curl up from cooking fires. And when the sun finally does burst forth to limn the frieze of jagged, snow-capped peaks behind the forested foothills, it is, indeed, like being present at creation.For guests at Malikha Lodge, most of whom are European, the next morning sound is the lock turning in their bungalow door as a staff member steals in to light the woodstove and take the chill off the room. But, truth be told, it is only after the generator comes back on and the electric blanket on top of everyone\u2019s thick quilt returns to life that most visitors begin to feel fortified enough to finally greet the dawn themselves, rise, pull on some frigid clothing and troop off to the main building for a delicious breakfast.And then?Well, there is a fascinating early morning outdoor market in Putao to visit, elephants to ride, rapids to shoot, treks to remote villages to take and wild orchids to find.Or one can just enjoy some remedial lounging, a lunch in the lodge\u2019s excellent communal restaurant, some quiet reading around the fire in the main lounge, a little restorative napping in one\u2019s elegantly canopied (with a mosquito net) bed or a massage (the first of which is gratis for every guest).Affiliated with the Aureum Palace Hotels & Resorts and Myanmar Treasure Resorts, a confederation of five-star properties controlled by the Htoo Group of Companies, whose chairman is the prominent businessman U Tay Za, the Malikha Lodge has the benefit of being connected to what is perhaps the best-run network of high-end hotels and resorts in Myanmar.However, U Tay Za also has the distinction of being on the United States Department of Treasury\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals list, a roster established by Washington during the military junta to sanction Myanmar\u2019s so-called \u201ccronies,\u201d businessmen accused of profiting by collaborating with the ruling generals. While many \u201ccronies\u201d did accept concessions from the generals and still profit from what critics characterize as a \u201clooting of the country,\u201d there is nonetheless an international inconsistency inherent in Myanmar\u2019s being on the list: Most other countries with equally reprehensible records of abuse are unencumbered by such lists. What is more, one of those very generals, Thein Sein, who ran the old junta, is now not only Myanmar\u2019s president, but also the architect of the country\u2019s unexpected and quite ambitious reform agenda. As such, he was conveniently removed from the list so that, as the country made its volte-face \u2014 releasing political prisoners, abandoning press censorship and seeking to restore constitutional government \u2014 he was eligible to meet with President Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry.Yet because many other former military leaders and businessmen who worked together under the junta remain on the list, Myanmar confronts a unique problem: How can the new government successfully promote development and fully enter the global economy when so many of its biggest commercial players are sidelined?The American ambassador to Myanmar, Derek J. Mitchell, sees utility in maintaining some kind of continuing sanctions, especially during this difficult time of transition when the reform movement is threatened on so many fronts. But he frankly acknowledged to me that if the United States is going to keep people in Myanmar on such a list, it also ought to allow a clearly defined process for them to get off.However, there is the challenge of reforming governance in this ethnically divided country; indeed, of refashioning the very essence of Myanmar itself. As this uncertain process continues to unfold, Myanmar finds itself in the anomalous position of having the further development of much of its best tourist infrastructure \u2014 hotels, travel agencies and airlines \u2014 complicated by the very United States sanctions that are supposed to be helping it.And the Htoo Group\u2019s chain of resorts and hotels, which happen to cover the breadth of Myanmar and comprise one of its best networks of accommodations, will be an important piece of the hospitality industry\u2019s future in this still very underdeveloped and infrastructure-challenged land. Composed of some 12 properties in all, the chain includes some of Myanmar\u2019s best-known hotels and resorts, from the elegant Kandawgyi Palace in Yangon and the Popa Mountain Resort near Bagan to the singular Malikha Lodge in Putao. Even as many large hotel chains like Hilton and Shangri-la are now clamoring to open properties in Myanmar and are changing the chemistry of visiting this once-languid backwater, for now one could hardly do better as a visitor than to simply travel from one of these properties to another like a Franciscan friar making his way up the California coast by stopping one after another at Spanish missions.Despite their indelibly authoritarian provenance, Myanmar\u2019s generals did unexpectedly, and very counterintuitively, begin reforming their own government in 2011. It was a stunning about-face that caught almost everyone off guard. While they remain very much in transition with the outcome of their efforts still uncertain, what is everywhere evident to any of the growing number of visitors to the country is Myanmar\u2019s enduring physical beauty, rich and largely Buddhist culture and extremely open and warm-hearted people (attacks by Buddhist extremists against Muslims in Rakhine State notwithstanding).What is more, unlike other popular Asian tourist destinations such as China, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, which have increasingly become theme-park-like experiences leeched of authenticity, in Myanmar it is still possible for visitors to become lost in a culturally varied and vibrant indigenous society that has yet to become a commercially mummified simulacrum of its former self.But for now, strolling through the beguiling small town of Mulashidi, just outside the gates of the Malikha Lodge, laid out well over a half century ago by J. Russell Morse and his mission, one still gets the feeling of being immersed in an earlier time, when people made their own houses out of local rattan and thatch, kept a yard full of chickens and a pig, cultivated their own fruits and vegetables, rose with their roosters in the morning and then smiled to neighbors as they walked to work or school.Advertisement"}

You\u2019re comfortable. You\u2019re like, \u2018Hi, hi, hi.' \u201dThe guests that evening were celebrating the 25th anniversary of Michael\u2019s, the Midtown restaurant that is best known for its media power lunches. Mr. Gumbel, who still has his show on HBO, comes here once every couple of months. He thought back to all of the deals.\u201cI remember when I left NBC and was talking to CBS, having a lunch here with Leslie Moonves,\u201d Mr. Gumbel said, referring to his change in employers, in 1997. He nodded toward Mr. Moonves, the CBS Corporation chief executive, who was across the room.The media machers were there. But a younger set of dealmakers most definitely was not. The thought of hourslong, sometimes vodka-soaked lunches is a wee bit foreign to the newest generation of media stars.The online leaders of new media are not flocking to power canteens like Michael\u2019s or the Four Seasons. The get-togethers and deals that otherwise would have been made between noon and 2 p.m. are now made elsewhere, at all hours: conference rooms; over coffee, cocktails or breakfast; on Skype, Gchat or email. The status conferred upon those who get the best seat in the house is not necessary or even valuable to this crew, which measures its clout in retweets and followers, not table position.Media power lunches are out. Crumbs in your keyboard? In.\u201cThe number of delivery people that are here during the day is astounding,\u201d Mr. Lerer said on the phone from his office. \u201cThe number of snacks we have is, if not astounding, impressive. The idea that someone would take an hourlong lunch break is ludicrous. Every time I\u2019ve gone to Michael\u2019s, I want to immediately go home and take a nap.\u201dWho has the time for it anyway?\u201cIt\u2019s the perception of the time suck,\u201d said Lockhart Steele, the editorial director of Vox Media and a co-founder of websites like Curbed, Eater and Racked. \u201cThere\u2019s always that slightly alarming feeling of returning from a long lunch and clicking on Twitter, and everyone is discussing something while you were away, and you\u2019re like, \u2018What are they talking about?\u2019 Just catching up to speed takes 20 minutes. We all live in a constant news stream, and as a result, it forces our hand a little bit with how much we can break up our day.\u201dHe added: \u201cJust walking down the street to go to Pain Quotidien is considered a massive, impressive lunch move.\u201dIf Google and Facebook employees are not going out to lunch, neither is a large swath of the tech world (trickle-down eat-conomics).Brooke Hammerling, the founder of the New York-based public relations firm Brew Media Relations, which represents companies like Refinery29 and WordPress.com, prefers to conduct her business elsewhere.\u201cThe business deals are happening on social, on email, on texting or happening at those conferences,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in walking. I learned that from Daniel Ek at Spotify,\u201d she said, referring to the streaming music service\u2019s co-founder. \u201cIf it\u2019s not cold, one of the greatest things you can do with a potential client is walk and talk. You\u2019re concentrating on that person entirely.\u201dWhen Ms. Hammerling hired the director at her company, she didn\u2019t have to walk very far: It was a dreary day outside, and they decided to meet at Ms. Hammerling\u2019s Greenwich Village apartment.\u201cShe was looking at big jobs everywhere,\u201d Ms. Hammerling said. \u201cThe conversation became so intimate. The cat was on her lap, and I was sitting there barefoot making her coffee. And she called me a couple of days later, and she said, \u2018I want that, I want to work with you, I want that experience.' \u201dMuch of New York\u2019s new media ethos comes from Silicon Valley, where deals and get-togethers are done on the move. Paul Holland, a venture capitalist, came of age when partnership and investment agreements were hammered out at restaurants like the Lion & Compass in Sunnyvale, Calif. These days? His company, Foundation Capital, organizes food-truck parties in California.\u201cAt a restaurant, you have white tablecloths, waiters in white shirts who are waiting to serve you and pour you water,\u201d Mr. Holland said. \u201cThe visceral reaction that gives is it\u2019s formal. If you see food trucks, a couple of lights strung up and music, it just feels fun. There are a limited number of really, really sharp young entrepreneurs, and we want them to come and interact with us. We\u2019re competing for the attention of these people. To have them come to something stiff versus loose and fun?\u201dWhen Max Ventilla pitched his idea for AltSchool, an education start-up, he did so over pizza from the Del Popolo food truck in San Francisco, while seated on some cascading steps in an outdoor plaza.\u201cHe fired up the laptop and pitched the company,\u201d said Kanyi Maqubela, a partner at Collaborative Fund. \u201cIt was really a walking meeting with a lunch meeting. We finished lunch in 10 minutes. We walked for seven or eight blocks. We made the investment. That was the extent of it. It was probably 45 or 50 minutes.\u201dMr. Maqubela said that, even though money is changing hands (his group invested nearly $500,000 in Mr. Ventilla\u2019s start-up), lunch at a restaurant would be regarded as far too formal and logistically impractical. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to pull out a computer and go through an investment deck and a slide show,\u201d he said.To an older generation, all of this is heresy. Having a good lunch is a vital tenet to working at a media institution, even if some loyalists concede that they aren\u2019t always productive. Lunches are often times about just marching through Michael\u2019s \u2014 the pageantry is the whole point of it.\u201cNot only does lunch provide status, you might actually get something done,\u201d said Gil Schwartz, the chief communications officer for the CBS Corporation and a book author and Fortune columnist who goes by the pen name Stanley Bing. \u201cIn my own career, out of the four trillion lunches I\u2019ve gone to, I\u2019ve had four or five that actually produced significant gain for either myself or the company.\u201dMr. Schwartz argued for the \u201crestorative\u201d aspects of lunch: getting out of the office, maybe doing a little business and (important) being seen by others.\u201cTo give people a feeding time of 10 minutes so they can cram down a sandwich at their desk, it\u2019s like something out of \u2018Brave New World\u2019 or \u20181984,' \u201d he said. \u201cSchoolchildren have lunch, field workers have it.\u201dAnd this is not to say that lunch has been abandoned. Editors and publishers at legacy publishers like Cond\u00e9 Nast dine out regularly. (And with a move underway to 1 World Trade Center, Cond\u00e9 Nast editors have started flocking to the Odeon on West Broadway.)Tech-media folks have the restaurant Lure Fishbar in SoHo as a club for their kind. Mr. Steele said that he\u2019s trying to land a \u201cmajor hire\u201d and has been courting this recruit with fancy lunches. Jonah Peretti, a co-founder of BuzzFeed, is blas\u00e9 about the power lunch, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have a strong view on the business lunch. I eat in, I eat out, I\u2019m not too particular.\u201dAnd perhaps all of these things \u2014 lunch, economies, fashion trends \u2014 are just cyclical.\u201cIn 10 years, who knows, we\u2019ll all go back to wearing suits,\u201d Mr. Holland said.Perhaps even in restaurants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Legalized Gambling on Sports", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyWhen the N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver announced in November that he was in favor of legalizing sports betting in the United States, he shattered decades of genteel sporting tradition. For generations, major professional sports leagues in America have done their best to pretend sports gambling does not exist. But, as Silver wrote in an opinion column in The Times, illegal gambling is already everywhere. Urging legislators to contend with the reality that information technology has made it impossible to confine sports betting to Nevada, Silver argued for taking the market, worth an estimated $400 billion a year, into the realm of the licit.What Silver didn\u2019t dwell on was the N.B.A.\u2019s own gambling history. While every big league has had its betting scandals, the N.B.A.\u2019s embarrassment has been the most recent and the most lurid. In 2007, a referee named Tim Donaghy admitted that he passed inside information to gamblers and bet on games he officiated. Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but his case still casts a shadow on the league\u2019s reputation.The N.B.A.\u2019s willingness to break with other major leagues on the issue of betting may reflect, at least in part, a counterintuitive but judicious appreciation of its own particular reality: Of all the major American spectator sports, basketball is arguably the most susceptible to betting scandals. And according to a number of economists, more betting, not less, would help the game protect its integrity. That is, as long as it\u2019s done legally.Basketball is made even more vulnerable because of the popularity of \u201cspread\u201d betting, based on a prediction by bookmakers on which team will win and by how much. A strong team might be favored by, say, 10 points over a weak team. If the favorite fails to win by more than that margin, those who bet on the underdog cash in.The spread is intended to even up the amount of betting on each team and reduce the risk to bookies. Unfortunately, it also means a corrupt player on the better team might be tempted to cheat: Given the right financial motivation, he can satisfy his coaches, teammates and fans by winning the game, but he can also miss just enough shots to ensure that his team fails to cover the spread, so that bettors on the weaker team cash in.This is not a hypothetical concern. Point-shaving scandals have been a recurring feature of college basketball since two City College of New York players were arrested in 1951 on charges of conspiracy. Henry Hill, the mobster whose life inspired \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d helped plan a major point-shaving operation at Boston College in the 1970s. In 2012, a player and a former assistant coach pleaded guilty to point shaving at the University of San Diego during the 2009-10 season.The most statistically damning indictment of the college game comes from Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist and former bookie\u2019s apprentice in his native Australia. (Wolfers also contributes to The Times.) In 2006 he subjected 16 recent years of N.C.A.A. basketball scores to rigorous analysis. He found that in games with big point spreads, where one team was favored to win by 12 points or more, the favored team just barely fell short of covering the spread far more often than would be expected in the normal course of events. While not conclusive evidence of cheating, the pattern was exactly what you would expect to see if someone on the better squad was aware of the spread and was working to ensure that a bet on the weaker team would pay off. Wolfers concluded that around one in 100 college games may have been fixed in this way.An economics student at Stanford University, Jonathan Gibbs, was inspired by Wolfers\u2019s paper to perform a similar analysis of the professional game. His senior thesis, delivered in May 2007, examined more than 15,000 N.B.A. games played between 1993 and 2007, using a methodology based on Wolfers\u2019s. It, too, showed there was a statistically significant overabundance of cases in which heavily favored teams just failed to cover the spread set by Las Vegas bookmakers.Match fixing, in which players are paid to lose games, has become a massive problem abroad, especially in lower-tier soccer and international cricket, where players earn far less than N.B.A. stars. In 2013, Europol, the European Union\u2019s law-enforcement agency, uncovered a criminal network involving players, officials and club employees that the agency said spent more than two million euros (about $3 million) in an attempt to fix more than 380 European soccer matches.Stefan Szymanski, an economist at the University of Michigan who has researched sports and corruption, said that, despite all the chicanery spurred by gambling, legalizing it would actually help crack down on cheating. Not only are illegal bookies more likely to fix matches, they also can\u2019t go to the authorities if they suspect they\u2019ve been wronged. But legal bookmakers subject to government regulation have a powerful reason to keep sports honest, because nothing scares away customers faster than the suspicion that a game is rigged.Taking gambling into the light makes the marketplace more hostile to cheaters. In Britain, betting shops were legalized in 1961, and giant gambling companies, like William Hill and Ladbrokes, now watch out for suspiciously large (and prescient) bets. Today the English Premier League no longer suffers from the betting scandals that once afflicted top-flight British soccer. FIFA, the governing body for international soccer, works closely with legal bookmakers to spot unusual betting activity.\u201cIf you talk to legal bookmakers, they\u2019re willing to do just about anything to spot and prevent match fixing,\u201d Szymanski says. \u201cIt\u2019s in their best interest to ensure games are honest. From a regulator\u2019s perspective, if you legalize sports gambling, you enlist an army of private businesspeople that want to help you police a sport.\u201dWolfers says that gambling demonstrates an important economic principle \u2014 that customers prefer transparent, regulated markets to the wild, unregulated alternative. Whether it\u2019s legal marijuana dispensaries in Colorado or legal gambling shops in Las Vegas and England, consumers prefer reliability when it\u2019s available, and the state\u2019s imprimatur goes a long way toward ensuring that. He added that legal, regulated gambling could allow for simple market fixes with wide-reaching implications. For example, a ban on spread betting would eradicate the specter of point-shaving.\u201cBettors like regulated legal betting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ensures you get paid if you win. It guarantees you don\u2019t get your legs broken if you lose. In every case I know, regulated gambling competes unregulated gambling out of existence.\u201dBut this all presupposes that greed has an upper bound, which not everyone believes. Maria Haberfeld, chairwoman of the department of law, police science and criminal justice administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says she was staggered when she first began to study corruption in international sports three years ago and realized its enormous scope. She argues against legalizing gambling, saying that it would only ramp up the incentive to find new ways to fix games. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lot of money involved, ethics tend to disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople just become more ingenious at finding new ways to turn a profit.\u201dIan McGugan writes about business and economics\nin Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Reprieve to Obama, Senate Democrats Agree to Wait on Iran Sanctions", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ten Senate Democrats who have advocated putting more sanctions on Iran gave the White House a two-month reprieve on Tuesday, saying they would wait until after the late-March deadline for completing the outlines of a deal to restrain Tehran\u2019s nuclear program before voting for a bill that President Obama has said would undermine any chance of reaching an agreement. The concession came in a letter to Mr. Obama from Senator Robert Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who has been increasingly at odds with the White House for his strong advocacy of a bill intended to squeeze Iran\u2019s oil revenues even harder if the nuclear negotiations do not result in an agreement. But Mr. Menendez\u2019s letter made clear that he and the other Democrats would join Senate Republicans if a meaningful accord was not reached by March 24. While Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed optimism that an extension agreed upon in November would lead to a speedy agreement, talks have been largely stalemated since then, and few of Mr. Kerry\u2019s aides now believe that deadline can be met. The ultimate deadline for the talks is the end of June, by which time the two countries are supposed to develop a detailed accord. Mr. Menendez wrote in the letter that he and the other senators \u201cremain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24.\u201d But he said that in deference to Mr. Obama\u2019s fears that any new sanctions would undermine negotiations, \u201cwe will only vote for this legislation on the Senate floor if Iran fails to reach agreement on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.\u201d\u201cThis deadline is the critical test of Iranian intentions,\u201d the senator said. Other senators signing the letter included Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, usually close allies of the president.The offer to Mr. Obama is double-edged, because it greatly reduces the chances that he can win another extension of the negotiations while keeping many of the current restrictions on Iran\u2019s program in place. Until now, some of Mr. Obama\u2019s current and former advisers on the Iran issue, perhaps the biggest single potential foreign policy breakthrough of his last two years in office, have argued privately that \u201cmanaged irresolution\u201d of the problem would be preferable to a breakdown in talks that could lead to a military standoff.At least some influential Republicans seemed willing to go along with the delay, sensing that an alliance with Senate Democrats could ultimately give them more leverage over the shape of a final agreement, if there is one. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a proponent of new sanctions, said, \u201cThe last thing we need to do is pass a bill out of the U.S. Senate that is not veto-proof.\u201dThe letter came on the same day as congressional Republicans held two hearings about the usefulness of additional sanctions as they sought ways to hem in Mr. Obama\u2019s team of negotiators. As part of that effort, they also found some unintended allies 6,000 miles away.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.In recent days, conservatives in the Iranian Parliament have said they are working on a resolution of their own to counter American pressure by binding the hands of Iran\u2019s negotiating team and stopping them from agreeing to production limits on nuclear fuel. Like many in Congress, they would be happy to see the current negotiations collapse. In fact, their proposals would require Tehran to deploy centrifuges that can enrich uranium far more efficiently than ever. \u201cCongress is trying to force the administration to adopt a harder line in the negotiations,\u201d said Edward Levine, a former senior staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The Iranians, he said, \u201care trying something similar.\u201dSome of the experts who testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday said they did not accept the claim that new sanctions would undercut any chance to strike a deal. \u201cThese would only come into effect if Iran cheats, or doesn\u2019t make a deal,\u201d one of the witnesses, Eric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense in the Bush administration, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical of the argument that unless we do something for Iran, it will walk away from the table. My view is that if the supreme leader wants a deal, there will be a deal.\u201dThe Iranian threat to resume high-level enrichment, which would shorten the time it would take to build a bomb, was clearly intended by military leaders and other hard-liners as a signal to Mr. Zarif. He must come back, they are saying, with a deal that ensures Iran\u2019s ability to hold on to much of its nuclear infrastructure \u2014 and thus the capacity to assemble a weapon if its leadership decides it needs one.Advertisement"}

Well, not in person. Reid fell off an exercise machine at his house last week and he\u2019s staying home until he no longer looks as if he was pummeled on his way to the cafeteria.The Democrats\u2019 second in command, Dick Durbin, promised that the Democrats would be \u201ca much better minority\u201d than the Republicans were. Meanwhile, the new majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised to end Reid\u2019s dictatorial tendencies and make the Senate \u201can engine for bipartisan achievement.\u201d McConnell and Reid both have a talent for depressing, cranky oratory. However, McConnell did interject a moment of levity when he suggested that the current rather remarkable strength of the American economy was because of consumer ebullience over the election of a Republican majority in the Senate.Anyhow, everybody in the Senate vowed to improve on last year\u2019s performance. Then they instantly launched into a debate on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.What\u2019s the rush? The pipeline\u2019s not going anywhere until a Nebraska court case gets worked out. And oil futures are currently down to around $50 a barrel, while the Canadian pipeline oil needs to sell for about $85.Well, there are reasons. Passing the bill would make a lot of political donors happy. It would give senators a chance to demand that the United States, which became the No. 1 oil producer in the world during the Obama administration, do something about energy independence. It\u2019s a chance to talk about jobs, even though the actual permanent employment created by the pipeline would be about as large as the opening of a new highway tollbooth.Most important of all, the bill has a number of Democratic supporters, allowing orators to use the word \u201cbipartisan\u201d about 20 times a minute.Meanwhile, in the very same new spirit of amity, House Speaker John Boehner assured the members that they would march into the future \u201con common ground, both in letter and in spirit.\u201d This was right after his re-election. Yes, John Boehner is once again speaker of the House! Perhaps this was not on the top of your new-year wish-list either.The Republican alternatives included Representative Ted Yoho, the large-animal veterinarian from Florida who once argued that the Affordable Care Act was \u201cracist\u201d because it includes a tax on tanning beds. Another candidate was Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas, who warned that Muslim extremists were sneaking pregnant women into the United States to give birth to babies who \u201ccould be raised and coddled as future terrorists.\u201d The rebel who got the most support, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, was nominated by Steve King of Iowa, the guy who complained about young undocumented immigrants with \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d \u201cMy door is always open,\u201d the triumphant Boehner told the House. Then he added: \u201cNow don\u2019t get carried away with this, all right?\u201dWe appreciate that attitude in Boehner. Also, we appreciate him refusing to back up Yoho when Yoho claimed the speaker had agreed with his theory about tanning beds.On the other hand, Boehner stayed behind the majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was re-elected despite the revelation that when he was a state legislator in 2002, he gave a speech to members of a white supremacy group. \u201cI know what\u2019s in his heart,\u201d said the speaker. How do you feel about this one? Scalise said the appearance was a mistake, and it is true that many politicians could make a speech before an assembly of cabbages without noticing that there was anything unusual about the room. On the other hand, in 2004, Scalise was one out of only six people in the 104-member Louisiana House to vote against making Martin Luther King Day a state holiday.Let\u2019s hope that when we look back on the 114th Congress we don\u2019t remember that the high point was John Boehner beating out Ted Yoho. In fact, a truly cynical mind might wonder if the whole rebellion wasn\u2019t staged by Boehner partisans just to show how horrific the alternative was.

A number of business and economic reports Tuesday showed the kinds of winners and losers we can expect for months to come as the impact of those market moves percolates through companies large and small.The news was not without bright spots, but markets viewed it decidedly negatively in the aggregate, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index down 1.5 percent in morning trading. It is a reminder that for every American enjoying a cheaper tank of gas or a more affordable mortgage, there are also major employers wrestling with less investment in new oil exploration and lower earnings from abroad. And it is an object lesson in how the seemingly abstract moves in markets can affect real companies and real people.These are the four major effects on display.The stronger dollar is bad for U.S. multinationals.Companies that have headquarters in the United States but bring in much of their revenue from abroad are facing a predicament: The appreciation in the dollar (and the flip side, a depreciation of most foreign currencies) means that their sales overseas are not worth as much as they used to be. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up 17.7 percent since June 30.Procter & Gamble, the giant consumer goods company, is a perfect example. In its 2014 fiscal year, 61 percent of its sales were from outside North America. And its results for the final months of the year, released Tuesday, show just how challenging the rise in the dollar will be.Foreign exchange moves will cause the company\u2019s earnings to fall 12 percent for its 2015 fiscal year, according to its news release, or $1.4 billion after tax.The oil price decline means less investment spending.The currency shift wasn\u2019t the only bad news for Caterpillar. The company sells much of its equipment to companies involved in oil exploration, and the drop of more than 50 percent in the price of oil since the summer means that demand for such equipment may soon dry up. It doesn\u2019t help that most other commodity prices are down as well, including copper and iron ore, which means mining activity could suffer as well.Caterpillar on Tuesday forecast 2015 sales of $50 billion, down from $55.2 billion in 2015.\u201cThe recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year-over-year decline in our sales and revenues outlook,\u201d Doug Oberhelman, the chief executive, said in the company\u2019s earnings release. \u201cCurrent oil prices are a significant headwind for energy and transportation and negative for our construction business in the oil producing regions of the world.\u201dThe combination of a stronger dollar and lower oil price \u2014 with resulting lower investment in oil exploration \u2014 may already be affecting the overall economic results.Orders for durable goods fell 3.4 percent in December. That was primarily because of a fall in orders for aircraft, but orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 a signal of future business investment \u2014 fell 0.2 percent, hardly a resounding sign of confidence from the corporate sector.But it\u2019s better news for energy consumers.If you are a consumer of energy rather than a producer, the drop in oil prices is sunnier news, and that showed on Tuesday in the latest numbers from American Airlines. The company\u2019s revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter, while operating expenses fell, primarily because of a 17.3 percent drop in fuel cost.That helped the company swing to a $597 million profit in the final three months of the year, compared with a $1.95 billion combined loss for its two predecessor companies, AMR Corporation and US Airways, in 2013.And it\u2019s not just companies benefiting from lower fuel prices. A falling price of gasoline is likely a factor in a sharp rise in consumer confidence in January. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence rose 9.8 points to 102.6, the highest since August 2007.In effect, the big question as lower oil prices spread through the economy in 2015 is which force will prove more powerful \u2014 the benefits to consumers and businesses that use petroleum products, or the lower oil exploration activity likely to result. Most economists are betting on the former.The bond market rally is good for home buyers.The same forces that led to a rising dollar in recent months have meant lower long-term interest rates across the economy, including for home buyers. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage started 2014 at around 4.5 percent before ending the year at about 3.9 percent.This may be creating a tailwind for housing activity, which was steady in 2014 but showed few signs of accelerating.On Tuesday, the Census Bureau said that new home sales rose 11.6 percent in December, with rising prices and upward revisions to previous months. Separately, the S.&P./Case-Shiller home price index showed that home prices rose 0.7 percent in 20 major cities in November, with price rises in every city.Eight years after the housing boom started to turn to bust, the sector may not be booming, but with the help of lower mortgage rates it is contributing to economic growth even as the strong dollar and lower energy investment pull the American economy the other way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BMW and Volkswagen Team Up to Expand Network of High-Speed Charging Stations", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, BMW and Volkswagen announced a plan to install 100 high-speed charging stations on busy corridors this year on the East and West Coasts, like Interstate 95 between here and Boston. The stations will be part of a fast-growing network run by ChargePoint, the nation\u2019s largest, and will be compatible with nearly all electric vehicles on the road.BMW and VW are taking a cue from Tesla Motors, which has its own network of high-speed chargers in the Northeast corridor and in California, but its proprietary connectors work only with Tesla\u2019s cars.Some analysts, though, warned that even 100 new stations would barely begin to provide the infrastructure needed to give electric vehicles broad acceptance.\u201cThere are more than 100 gas stations just in Santa Monica,\u201d said Eric Lyman, a senior analyst at TrueCar. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to reach the level of convenience of gasoline, which is a system that\u2019s developed over a century to put stations on nearly every commercial corner.\u201dStill, automakers, facing strict federal mandates to increase fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, have little choice but to press ahead. By 2025, their corporate average fuel economy must be at least 54.5 miles a gallon, well above the current average of 25 miles a gallon.Only about 120,000 vehicles that require a plug-in electric charge were sold in the United States last year, an increase of 20 percent over 2013 but a tiny fraction of the 16.5 million vehicles sold over all.Analysts, and automakers themselves, say the push to install high-speed charging stations is an acknowledgment of a miscalculation made when mass-market electric-powered vehicles were introduced five years ago. Consumers, carmakers figured, would be content with charging their cars at home, at the office and perhaps the local movie theater and would embrace a new class of electrified vehicles. After all, that would be enough for most Americans\u2019 commute, they assumed.But they soon discovered that consumers did not want their cars limited to commuting or short trips \u2014 a dynamic known as range anxiety.\u201cWhat we learned is people want to use their cars beyond a single charge range; they want to take longer trips, to drive like they were always used to driving,\u201d said Robert Healey, head of electric vehicle infrastructure at BMW of North America. \u201cEspecially important is they want one car that can be their primary vehicle.\u201dThat means easy access to fast, public charging stations that make a road trip in an electric car no different from one in a gas-powered sport utility vehicle.\u201cDrivers want to be on the road, with no fuss, and know that they can stop somewhere for a quick fill-up when they need one,\u201d Mr. Healey said. \u201cThat instinct hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dSince high-speed chargers are rare, automakers are pushing ahead with new efforts to fill the gap, hoping that easing range anxiety will be a breakthrough for electric cars\u2019 viability.Pasquale Romano, chief executive of ChargePoint, said for office buildings and \u201caround town\u201d charging, a few hours of being plugged in would be fine. But he said for longer trips, high-speed charging stations were a must.\u201cThis is the last piece of the puzzle to let people make an electric car be their primary vehicle,\u201d Mr. Romano said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re telling drivers they can\u2019t travel, and that just doesn\u2019t work.\u201dChargePoint has been aggressively expanding its network and now has more than 20,000 stations around the United States. Only about 120 of those, though, are high-speed versions that charge a car in about 20 minutes. The rest can take several hours.Mr. Lyman, the analyst, said that even though most drivers did not regularly take longer trips, such limitations still gave them pause.\u201cIt\u2019s the idea of \u2018I can\u2019t do it\u2019 that people fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like third-row seats in S.U.V.s. Most people don\u2019t ever use them, but they like having them there in case they need them.\u201dThe partnership among BMW, Volkswagen and ChargePoint aims to place the new high-speed chargers less than 50 miles apart along the Northeast corridor\u2019s Interstate 95 between here and Boston, and will expand the locations from there, including installing stations in larger cities in the region.BMW and Volkswagen are paying to build the stations and will decide on pricing for the electricity. ChargePoint\u2019s business is based on a subscription model; it provides a payment system and customer network for stations that are operated by others. (The company also sells charging equipment.)John O\u2019Dell of the automotive website Edmunds.com said the announcement was \u201cgreat, but it\u2019s just a start.\u201d\u201cFor both battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, the refueling structure is critical,\u201d he said.Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles received a lift on Thursday as well, as Toyota announced it was joining with the supplier Air Liquide to build 12 hydrogen fuel stations in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, That Other Shoe Still Didn\u2019t Drop ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBONDS confounded conventional wisdom in 2014 with a much-better-than-expected return.Yet the bellwether Treasury note ended 2014 at 2.17 percent after starting it at 3 percent. And while the United States economy showed some vigor \u2014 typically a trigger for rates to rise \u2014 global investors fleeing weakness in other markets were eager to buy American bonds. That demand pushed bond prices higher and yields lower.The upshot is that last year was frustrating only for the bond bears who have been waiting since 2009 for interest rates to rise from the abnormally low levels manufactured by Federal Reserve policy.Morningstar\u2019s index of intermediate-term core bond funds \u2014 the high-quality portfolios that are the heart of most retirement plans \u2014 had a total return of more than 5 percent in 2014. Total return is the sum of the income (the yield) the fund earned and any changes in the underlying price of bonds in the portfolio. The five-year annualized gain of 4.8 percent for the index of core bond funds was also anything but bad news.Yet if you\u2019ve followed the predictions of many bond experts since Fed policy pushed interest rates low during the financial crisis, you might think that core bond funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 especially those that closely mimic the look and feel of the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index \u2014 are supposedly ill-equipped for today\u2019s world.A common warning is that core bond funds, with an average duration of more than five years, will suffer bigger price declines than funds with shorter durations. Duration is a measure of a fund\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates; when rates rise, a fund with a longer duration will have steeper price declines than one with a shorter duration. That\u2019s absolutely true. But hiding out in short-term bond funds with their lower yields has its own opportunity cost. The 2.3 percent average annualized gain for playing it safe in short-term bonds over the last five years was less than half the return of core bond funds.And if history is any guide, even when rates do rise, the higher income payouts from a core bond portfolio offset the price declines over time. From the end of 1948, when an intermediate-term government bond yielded just 1.5 percent, to the end of 1981, when it almost reached 14 percent, the annualized total return was still around 4 percent, according to data from Ibbotson Associates, a unit of Morningstar.Another common criticism of high-quality bond funds is that they are heavily invested in areas of the market that are now the most expensive: United States Treasuries and government-backed mortgage bonds. But that conversation often doesn\u2019t mention that high-quality bonds are best equipped to provide risk-damping diversification when stocks plunge.\u201cBonds have been like a high-scoring basketball player, riding the long decline in rates, and that\u2019s what everyone focuses on,\u201d says Craig Israelsen, who teaches in the financial planning program at Utah Valley University.Over the very long haul \u2014 from 1981 through 2013 \u2014 the average intermediate-term government bond had an annualized gain of 8 percent, according to Ibbotson data. That sort of performance may be off the table now that rates have little room to move lower. But what remains intact is the ability of high-quality bonds to do well when stocks swoon.Defense could be especially valuable right now.And don\u2019t expect the new breed of bond funds that flaunt a go-anywhere approach in pursuit of yield and returns to provide the same downside protection. According to Morningstar, these funds, on average, have about one-third of their assets invested in bonds rated below investment grade, also known as high-yield or junk bonds. Such bonds tend to move more in sync with stocks than with Treasuries; in 2008, an index of high-yield bonds lost more than 26 percent.\u201cWhen equities are going down, unconstrained bond funds may not provide traditional diversification,\u201d said Mr. Kane at TCW.The average high-grade intermediate-term bond fund has less than 6 percent of its assets invested in lower-quality bonds. Funds and E.T.F.s that track the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index do not invest in bonds rated below investment grade.This doesn\u2019t make go-anywhere funds a bad choice. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of having eyes wide open to the credit risk you are taking on,\u201d said Mr. Davis at Vanguard.\u201cThose are the bonds the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program focused on and has driven to very expensive levels,\u201d Mr. Ivascyn said.They are finding better values in mortgage-backed bonds that lack a government guarantee. Mr. Ivascyn said such bonds would have more volatility than government bonds but were less risky than traditional junk bonds. He expects these nonagency mortgage bonds to deliver returns of around 5 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s double what the 10-year Treasury pays.\u201dOCCUPYING a middle ground between high-grade, index-tracking bond funds and the go-anywhere crowd are actively managed funds, with a limited mandate to venture beyond the types of bonds tracked by the Barclays aggregate index. The ability to deviate from the index has proved effective recently: According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, nearly 60 percent of core bond funds managed to outperform the index over the five years through June 2014.\u201cIt comes down to deciding what you want from bonds,\u201d said Mr. Israelsen at Utah Valley University. \u201cIf you value diversification, you should stick with classic high-grade funds. If you want higher yield and returns, just understand what you\u2019re buying into.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Expands at Slowest Rate in Quarter-Century", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina grew at its slowest rate in 24 years in 2014, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.The economy expanded by 7.3 percent in the last quarter of the year, and 7.4 percent for the full year. Although that kind of growth would be welcomed by most countries, it falls short of the Chinese government\u2019s target of 7.5 percent for the year. The last time growth dipped below that level was in 1990, although growth was much slower that year, at 3.8 percent.Few economists were surprised by the slowdown. Even the country\u2019s senior leaders have said they were comfortable with slower, steadier growth, and its president, Xi Jinping, even coined a term for this new slowdown: the \u201cnew normal.\u201d\u201cYes, China\u2019s economy is slowing, but it\u2019s a natural slowdown after 30 years of rapid growth,\u201d Tao Wang, a China economist at UBS, said. \u201cIt still makes China the largest contributor to GDP growth in the world.\u201dAs Ma Jiantang, the head of China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, delivered a flood of data Tuesday morning, he said he was satisfied with China\u2019s economic growth in 2014.\u201cThis 7.4 percent was a 7.4 percent that overcame hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a 7.4 percent that overcame pressure. It\u2019s a 7.4 percent that suits the new normal\u200b of shifting the gears of the pace of economic development in line with objective laws.\u201dAs part of China\u2019s \u201cnew normal,\u201d the government has promised to shift its dependence on heavy investment and government spending. The latest numbers show that Beijing continues to invest in pockets of weakness in the economy, like real estate and exports, albeit it at a slower pace.Some the key figures released on Tuesday included industrial production, which increased by 8.3 percent in 2014. Recent industrial production figures, a bellwether China\u2019s factories, have pointed to underlying weakening demand.Fixed-asset investment grew at 15.7 percent in 2014, mainly driven by growing infrastructure investments, which increased 20.3 percent over 2014.The government is set to ramp up its infrastructure spending, after approving a slew of investment projects to help soften the pace of the slowdown. The National Development and Reform Commission approved new projects totaling more than 1 trillion renminbi, according to HSBC estimates. Many of these projects will start in 2015.As other parts of the Chinese economy falter, Beijing has turned to consumers to help pick up the slack. Overall retail sales, which has been slowing in recent months, grew by 12 percent over 2014. Online sales, meanwhile, grew by 49.7 percent.Mr. Ma said that although the statistics showed that traditional industries were running into difficulties, there were also new sources of growth, in particular from the Internet and mobile services.\u201cThis new momentum is rapidly emerging, and that\u2019s where our hope lies,\u201d he added.Fostering these new and growing sectors of the economy will be crucial for the government in 2015 as the economy downshifts and Beijing tries to wean itself off of credit-fueled investment.Raising the average household income in China will also be important to kickstart consumption-driven growth.The national average disposable income for urban citizens rose by 9 percent in 2014 to 28,844 renminbi, or $4,640.51. Rural disposable income grew even faster, at 11.2 percent, to 10,489 renminbi, or $1,686.88.The number of people in the labor force fell by 3.7 million people in 2014 to 916 million in 2014.Slower economic growth in 2015 may prompt the Chinese government to ramp up stimulus measures and infrastructure spending. Economists anticipate China\u2019s central bank will cut interest rates at least once this year, as the government attempts to stem a slowdown. Beijing made its first interest rate cut in over two years last November.As the engine of the global economy, a softening Chinese economy will reverberate around the world.An earlier version of this article reversed the growth figures for urban and rural disposable incomes. The national average disposable income for urban residents rose by 9 percent in 2014 to 28,844 renminbi, or $4,640.51; rural disposable income grew 11.2 percent to 10,489 renminbi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auction of a C\u00e9zanne Highlights New Realities", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For the first time in a decade, an important landscape painting by Paul C\u00e9zanne will be offered at auction. This would have been regarded as a significant event back in the 1980s, when telephone-number prices were being paid for Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works at black-tie sales in New York and London. But tastes have changed.The canvas, \u201cVue sur l\u2019Estaque et le Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If,\u201d circa 1883-1885, a vista of a sapphire-blue Mediterranean rising as flat as a playing card above geometric terracotta roofs, will be included in Christie\u2019s Feb. 4 auction of Impressionist and modern art in London. Consigned by the family of the prominent prewar British collector Samuel Courtauld, and offered without a guarantee, it carries an estimate of 8 million to 12 million pounds, about $12 million to $18 million. It had been on display in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, from 1985 to last year.The final price, of course, may well be something altogether different. Nonetheless, the valuation of a museum-exhibited painting by C\u00e9zanne, one of the most critically acclaimed and influential artists of the late 19th century, at the same level as a middling-quality Jean-Michel Basquiat or Jeff Koons, highlights the widening gap between what art history admires and what art collectors want.\u201cIt\u2019s all about fashion,\u201d said James Roundell, a director at the London and New York dealer and adviser Dickinson. \u201cToday\u2019s buyers want to be up to date, and they want what everyone else wants. Art experts tend to value C\u00e9zanne rather higher than collectors do. He\u2019s an intellectual artist, and there\u2019s usually something quite tough in his paintings.\u201dImpressionist and modern art is, with a few notable exceptions, no longer the force it was in the market.Younger collectors in Europe and America regard it as an old-fashioned taste, and quality material is in short supply after the art market boom and bust of the late 1980s and early \u201990s.But C\u00e9zanne, with his almost godlike aura as the father of modern painting, is one of those exceptions. He is, at the moment, the world\u2019s most expensive artist.In 2011, the state of Qatar reportedly paid $250 million for a circa 1895 C\u00e9zanne painting of card players that had been owned by the Greek shipping tycoon George Embiricos. And it emerged in December that the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House in Detroit had sold the 1904 landscape \u201cLa Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Ch\u00e2teau Noir\u201d for $100 million to an unidentified collector in 2013. Both sales were private transactions.Iconic subjects from the reclusive and revolutionary final 15 years of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s life in Aix-en-Provence (he died in 1906), like the card players, Mont Sainte-Victoire and his magisterial still lives, command huge prices. But earlier works that fall into the mainstream of the Impressionist and modern market can be a harder sell. \u201cWe had to put those big private sales out of our heads and base the valuation on the last good l\u2019Estaque landscape that came up for auction,\u201d said Jay Vincze, Christie\u2019s head of Impressionist and modern art in London. That was \u201cLes toits de l\u2019Estaque,\u201d a circa 1883-1885 canvas sold at Christie\u2019s New York in 1997 for $12.7 million, setting the lower valuation of this ex-Courtauld canvas, which has been lined and restored. \u201cIt is a conservative estimate,\u201d Mr. Vincze added.With contemporary art now dominating Europe and America\u2019s financialized, fashion-conscious art scene, Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s have become reliant on wealthy bidders from emerging economies like Russia and China to shore up demand at their Impressionist and modern auctions.Chinese buyers in particular tend to feel more confident buying the museum-proven brands of European painting \u2014 C\u00e9zanne, Monet, Van Gogh and Picasso \u2014 than the latest Los Angeles art sensation on social media. The $61.8 million paid by the Chinese movie tycoon Wang Zhongjun for a Van Gogh flower painting at Sotheby\u2019s in New York in November was an example of how Asian bidders are no longer just dipping their toes into the auction market for big-ticket Western art.Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s will be previewing their London Impressionist and modern highlights in Asia this month. Sotheby\u2019s will be taking at least three Monets from their Feb. 3 sale to Taiwan and Hong Kong, with the 1908 Venice series painting, \u201cLe Grand Canal,\u201d the highest-priced draw at \u00a320 million to \u00a330 million, backed by a third-party guarantor. The painting was on loan to the National Gallery in London from 2006 to 2014, having been bought at Sotheby\u2019s New York in 2005 for $12.9 million, about \u00a38.5 million today.The long-established business of buying and selling C\u00e9zannes and Monets might seem a universe away from today\u2019s iPhone-driven speculation in emerging artists. But though collecting tastes may have changed, art market history continues to repeat itself, albeit at a much quicker pace.\u201cVue sur l\u2019Estaque et le Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If\u201d is likely to have been one of the paintings the Paris dealer Ambroise Vollard acquired when, like some earlier version of Charles Saatchi or Stefan Simchowitz, he bought the entire contents of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s studio in 1897.The historian Gerald Reitlinger describes C\u00e9zanne in his 1961 masterwork \u201cThe Economics of Taste\u201d as \u201cthe greatest artistic speculation of the century.\u201d Reitlinger records how an 1877 still life bought at auction for \u00a3760 in 1907 \u2014 the year of the seismically influential C\u00e9zanne memorial exhibition at the Salon d\u2019Automne in Paris \u2014 was \u201cflipped\u201d for a tidy \u00a32,180 in 1913.Christie\u2019s February sale also includes \u201cPaysage \u00e0 l\u2019Estaque,\u201d a Fauvist landscape painted by Georges Braque in 1907, just a few months before his creative life was transformed \u2014 as was Picasso\u2019s \u2014 by that C\u00e9zanne exhibition. The painting is estimated at \u00a32 million to \u00a33 million. Had it been a C\u00e9zanne-inspired Cubist work from 1908 or 1909, the guide price would have been far higher.Although there had been sporadic exhibitions and sales of his work during his lifetime, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s critical reputation and credibility in the market were secured by that posthumous Paris retrospective of 56 of his paintings.There are plenty of dealers, collectors and speculators hoping that a similar sort of thing will happen to the 17 predominantly American younger artists selected for the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s current \u201cForever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World\u201d show in New York.But this being the 2010s, the market has already created commercial reputations for Mark Grotjahn, Mark Bradford and Julie Mehretu \u2014 all of whom have sold for more than $2 million at auction \u2014 long before MoMA gave them its seal of curatorial approval.On the other hand, the self-referential abstracts of the fellow \u201cForever Now\u201d pick Josh Smith (born 1976) are on fewer collectors\u2019 to-buy lists. A seller at Sotheby\u2019s day sale of contemporary works in London on Feb. 11 is hoping for an exhibition dividend when Mr. Smith\u2019s 2008 abstract, \u201cUntitled (JSC08586),\u201d with collage elements that hark back to Cubism, is offered with an estimate of \u00a37,000 to \u00a39,000. \u201cThe critics are out of the game,\u201d said the New York art adviser Todd Levin. \u201cThese days it\u2019s dealers and collectors who build value, and artistic value has become conflated with price. That\u2019s the problem.\u201dFor C\u00e9zanne, the son of a banker, big prices were only a problem after he died. Artists these days aren\u2019t prepared to wait that long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traces of Montana Oil Spill Are Found in Drinking Water", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHELENA, Mont. \u2014 Work crews burrowed through thick ice and set up containment booms Tuesday in a struggle to vacuum up 50,000 gallons of oil that spilled into the Yellowstone River from a ruptured pipeline, contaminating drinking water.The 12-inch steel pipeline, which burst Saturday morning near Glendive, Mont., about 400 miles east of here, sent light crude oil flowing downstream as far as the confluence with the Missouri River, 60 miles away in North Dakota. Health officials warned people not to use tap water in Glendive and surrounding towns after traces of benzene from the leak were found in a water treatment plant. Gov. Steve Bullock visited the area on Monday and declared a state of emergency for Dawson and Richland Counties. The Bridger Pipeline Company, which operates the line, has shut it down, company officials said. The line is part of a system that passes across eastern Montana from the Canadian border. Federal officials have said short-term exposure to the water was not dangerous. But residents near the spill found the water undrinkable.\u201cIt smells like diesel and it\u2019s oily,\u201d said Lisa Kjelstrup, a real estate agent in town who spent the day trying to determine how to get potable water to elderly residents. \u201cPeople are panicking right now. I don\u2019t think there was anything on the shelves.\u201dState officials and local grocery stores began trucking in pallets of bottled water Tuesday, and Glendive residents began making plans to shower and do laundry at the homes of friends and relatives who draw their water from wells.Residents said Tuesday that there should be no conflict between the need for strict environmental standards regulating oil and gas companies and the town\u2019s support for the oil and gas industry.\u201cEastern Montana is the energy producer for the state,\u201d said Jerry Jimison, Glendive\u2019s mayor. \u201cPeople down here deserve the same safeguards for safe water.\u201dGlendive, near the North Dakota border, sits on the edge of the Bakken Formation, one of the nation\u2019s richest oil-producing regions, where oil and gas production during the past decade has been a boon to the economies of dozens of small, formerly forlorn prairie towns in North Dakota and eastern Montana.Unemployment has fallen to 2.2 percent, according to the latest federal data, and an increase in home sales and local tax revenues is linked to the money pouring in from the oil fields and related industries. On Tuesday, residents complained that they had not been properly notified by either Bridger or local officials about the spill and the subsequent contamination of the treatment plant. Some people said they had learned about it via Facebook posts from other residents.\u201cI\u2019m O.K. with the pipeline,\u201d said Tracey Rod, who works in the local court system. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s making jobs around here.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI think the city should have told us more and the city should have been quicker.\u201d Some restaurants and other businesses that rely on city water decided to shut down. Some parents were planning to keep their children home from school, Ms. Kjelstrup said, even though school officials tried to reassure parents that they had plenty of bottled water for cooking and drinking. Lana Warner was serving coffee and lattes at Crazy Woman Espresso, using purified water that she buys outside Glendive. But she said she could not make frozen drinks \u2014 ice was off-limits \u2014 and could not wash blenders or dishes using tap water. On Tuesday morning, she said, she washed her hands and immediately noticed a petroleum odor. She decided there was no way she would drink \u2014 or serve \u2014 anything using municipal water for now. \u201cI can\u2019t get rid of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s made it kind of tough because everything you touch smells like that. As long as I smell it there\u2019s no way I\u2019m drinking it. And right now it\u2019s very, very strong.\u201dOther residents said that while they were taking precautions, they had noticed no problem with their tap water and believed the news of the spill was stirring up overreactions and hyperbole.Kathleen Rowell, manager of the Riverside Inn, said she set out a jar of water overnight and noticed no sheen of oil or odd smells the next day. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s going a little overboard,\u201d she said. \u201cI made coffee yesterday with regular tap water. It tasted fine. I showered. My kids all showered today and last night.\u201dEnvironmental groups, however, said the pipeline rupture was an omen.

In Canada, a broad measure of incomes has risen about 10 percent since 2000, even as it\u2019s fallen here. In Australia, it\u2019s up 30 percent.These aren\u2019t just any countries, either. They\u2019re among those most similar to the United States: far-flung, once ruled by Britain, with a frontier culture and a commitment to capitalism. Though Australia and Canada obviously are not identical to the United States, it certainly seems worth asking what they\u2019re doing differently.In a clear reference to China, the report notes that \u201capologists for anti-democratic regimes\u201d have used the stagnation of living standards in the West as a cudgel to argue that capitalist democracies are broken. Those democracies and China are now racing for influence across much of the world, especially in Africa and Asia.The report certainly includes ideas that can appeal to conservatives, including more employee ownership and profit-sharing at companies and a more rigorous approach to infrastructure financing. But it\u2019s hard not to see the report partly as the first draft of an agenda for a presumptive campaign by Mrs. Clinton.\u201cWe should not be fatalistic,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a commission member. \u201cThere are things we can do. They may be hard things. But there being hard things you can do is very different from there being nothing to do.\u201dThe efforts to create a more skilled work force in Canada and Australia (as well as Sweden and some other countries) have led to better jobs \u2013 and stronger pretax income growth.Beyond education, these other countries do more to intervene in the free market on behalf of the middle class and the poor.\u201cIt was a reasonable reading of history for a substantial time that the principal determinant of what happened to middle-class families was the overall rate of growth for the economy,\u201d Mr. Summers told me. \u201cToday, a substantial part of our success or failure in raising middle-class living standards will have to do not only with overall economic performance but also with the distribution of income.\u201dOne theme is that the countries where the middle class has fared better are countries where workers have more power. The share in labor unions is higher, much as unionized workers in this country make more than otherwise similar workers.Some countries also have less formal \u201cworker councils\u201d that advise management \u2013 and can push back against some of the short-termism that afflicts corporate America. A fascinating tidbit in the report is that privately held American companies devote more of their resources to long-term investments than publicly traded companies.Whatever you think about any one of these, I\u2019d argue that the crucial point is the broader one: Middle-class stagnation is not preordained. No country has found a magic bullet, but many are doing some things better than the United States \u2013 and have the better results to show for it.The debate over how \u2013 and whether \u2013 to help the American middle class and poor certainly has its technocratic aspects, as any policy debate must. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a debate about the future of America\u2019s global standing.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the cost of college in Australia.

Now What Happens to Its Food?", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byView From AbroadFor decades, the economies of Africa were the world\u2019s economic laggards. They aren\u2019t anymore. Over the last decade, Africa\u2019s per capita income has grown at a rate nearly identical to that of the rest of the world.Along with Africa\u2019s economic stirrings come many of the same questions that have confronted the rest of the developing world. And some of the most important revolve around food.Will the economic growth prove lasting and broad enough to end the continent\u2019s tragic famines? Will those Africans who today live almost entirely on starches like cassava be able to switch to a more varied and nutritious diet? How will farmers on the continent likely to suffer some of the worst consequences of climate change cope with it \u2014 and how can Africa\u2019s rising food production avoid accelerating that climate change?The food pessimists, of course, could hardly have been more wrong.And the Gateses are hardly pessimists. \u201cThe lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history,\u201d they write.When I spoke with them recently, I asked why food production needed to be among their big new goals. After all, private market economies have generally managed to deliver enough food, at least to countries on the rise. The same can\u2019t be said about medical care or education, two of the foundation\u2019s other main areas of emphasis.\u201cEven Simon\u2019s view was that humans would have to change to innovate,\u201d Mr. Gates said. Innovation, in other words, is not preordained. Indeed, it\u2019s happened much more in some societies than in others. And it has happened, Mr. Gates was arguing, because people and institutions took steps to remove the barriers to progress.With African agriculture, those barriers include roads that are too narrow to transport grain quickly, lack of knowledge about how crops fare best in some places and a dearth of basic information \u2014 on market prices, for instance \u2014 that hampers farmers. \u201cThey get taken by the middlemen,\u201d Ms. Gates said. \u201cIf they have a cellphone, they\u2019re informed.\u201dAll of those problems are at least partly market failures, and they won\u2019t automatically fix themselves. They are the kind of failures that governments or foundations can address.That possibility undoubtedly exists. But on many issues \u2014 in Africa and in the United States \u2014 doing more and doing better will require doing things differently.

Now, happily ensconced in a 35,000-square-foot estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Greene has a more optimistic outlook about real estate, at least when it comes to the very rich. Standing on his private beach, the 59-year-old real estate tycoon pointed to his new luxury hotel down the shore, called the Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa. Mr. Greene has purchased two other hotels in West Palm Beach and he is working on approvals to build two 30-story towers downtown that would house a five-star hotel, a conference center and the most expensive condos in town.\u201cIt\u2019s paradise here,\u201d he says, looking out over the crystal blue water as his wife, Mei Sze, and year-old son played nearby. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just getting wealthier.\u201dMr. Greene\u2019s ultimate wealth statement, however, is a 25-acre property, the Palazzo di Amore, in Beverly Hills, Calif., that he has been turning into a Hearst Castle of the second Gilded Age.The 35,000-square-foot main house has 12 bedrooms, 23 bathrooms, two kitchens and sweeping views of Los Angeles. There is a guesthouse, a 24-car garage and an \u201can entertainment complex\u201d with its own bowling alley, rotating dance floor, D.J. booth and laser lights. The complex also has its own vineyard \u2014 a rarity in Beverly Hills \u2014 and a wine cellar that can hold thousands of bottles.Mr. Greene has put the estate on the market, after seven years of building it. The asking price is $195 million, making it what is believed to be the most expensive public listing in the country.\u201cWhen you consider the value of the land and the quality of the construction,\u201d Mr. Greene said, \u201c$195 million is really quite reasonable.\u201dOnly a billionaire real estate promoter would call $195 million \u201creasonable.\u201d And while Mr. Greene says he didn\u2019t set out to list the most expensive home in the United States, real estate experts say the price is as much a marketing tactic to draw attention as it is a real reflection of value.\u201cThese are vanity numbers, and they are usually very far off from the ultimate sales price,\u201d says Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. \u201cJeff is a very smart real estate guy. But there are only a handful of people in the world who can buy this. And will any of them want to?\u201dLast year, three estates sold in the United States for more than $100 million, including the most expensive residence ever sold in the country \u2014 an 18-acre property in East Hampton sold to Barry Rosenstein, a hedge fund manager, for about $147 million. More than a half-dozen homes are currently listed for more than $100 million, including a beachfront property called Le Palais Royal being built near Boca Raton, Fla., and offered for $139 million. At least three penthouses in Manhattan carry price tags above $100 million. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a country of have-nots and have-a-lots,\u201d Mr. Greene said in his living room filled with French antiques and fine art. \u201cMore and more of the rewards for this economy are going to the rich and leaving the rest behind. So I think you\u2019re going to have more and more very wealthy people. And hopefully they\u2019re going to want houses like this.\u201dA self-proclaimed progressive and former Democratic Senate candidate in Florida, Mr. Greene is troubled by the new hollowed-out economics of housing, but also quick to profit from it. He has pledged half of his wealth to charity and says the rich should pay higher taxes, as long as education and government programs are also overhauled to create more opportunities for the middle class. Yet he made his biggest fortune betting on the housing crash, using complex financial instruments to target subprime mortgages. When many of those mortgage holders defaulted, Mr. Greene made more than $800 million. He is now worth more than $3 billion.Mr. Greene explains that he didn\u2019t cause any defaults \u2014 he simply bet they would happen. And his trades were aimed mainly at offsetting the possible decline in value of the hundreds of apartment units and other homes in California that made up most of his wealth. He didn\u2019t want a repeat of the early 1990s, when he lost most of his real estate fortune in the savings-and-loan crisis.The housing crisis was good for bargain-hunting, too. He picked up the Beverly Hills property \u2014 25 acres and a half-built house \u2014 out of receivership for $35 million in 2007, as California real estate was sliding. A longtime bachelor famed for his all-night parties and celebrity pals, Mr. Greene got married on the property in 2007, with Mike Tyson as the best man. He and his wife planned to live there when it was done.Mr. Greene hired one of the star developers in Los Angeles, Mohamed Hadid, to finish the estate. Shortly after they started, however, the couple decided to move to Florida for the more family-friendly lifestyle (and, perhaps, more friendly taxes). Instead of taking a few years, the Palazzo has taken more than seven years and over $25 million to finish. The trees and plants alone cost more than $5 million.\u201cIt just went on and on, since I\u2019m a perfectionist,\u201d Mr. Greene says. The main house is dripping with Old World luxury, with carved-wood moldings, chandeliers, gold faucets and marble. The floors are made from Bavarian walnut that was hand-scraped by dozens of woodworkers to make them look antique. The Turkish spa is attached to a \u201cMoroccan room\u201d that was carved and painted by craftsmen who work for the king of Morocco. \u201cThe king had to give them permission to make this,\u201d Mr. Hadid said during a recent tour. \u201cHe had to sign the papers.\u201dMr. Greene says the most likely buyer could be a Russian oligarch, a Saudi sheikh or a Chinese billionaire who wants security at a time of global and financial unrest. New tech wealth is also fueling sales around Los Angeles. A 23,000-square-foot ultramodern house in the Trousdale Estates area of Beverly Hills sold last month for $70 million to Markus Persson, the Swedish creator of the Minecraft video game. The builder of the home, Bruce Makowsky, is now working on another house expected to be priced at over $100 million, real estate agents say. Mr. Greene likes to distinguish his palatial Palazzo di Amore from the Modernist-style homes popping up in Beverly Hills by saying it \u201cis meant to be there for hundreds of years, just like any of the other great homes of the world.\u201dAnd homes, after all, are the ultimate investment, he says. Mr. Greene\u2019s four-acre compound in Palm Beach, which he bought for $24 million in 2009, is now worth well over $75 million, brokers say. He has no plans to sell. But he points out that even the most extravagant fixtures in the home \u2014 from the Picabia and Picassos on the wall to the 19th-century French chandeliers, can be resold for a possible profit at auction.\u201cI\u2019m very careful with how I spend my money,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I spend money on houses, I\u2019m not spending.

His trips this week, to Idaho on Wednesday and here on Thursday, are in places controlled by Republican governors and members of Congress.\u201cI\u2019m a Kansas guy,\u201d the president said, noting that while his mother was a native, those roots did not help him to carry the state in either of his presidential campaigns. \u201cI might have won sections of Lawrence \u2014 that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said with a smile, acknowledging the Democratic bent of the college town of about 90,000.Kansas is also home to Koch Industries and ground zero for the conservative political empire of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, backers of Americans for Prosperity, which spent $120 million in 2012 in attempts to defeat Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats.In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Obama argued that providing high-quality child care for families in which both parents work was an economic imperative. On Thursday, he said that in 31 states, a year of \u201chigh-quality\u201d child care currently costs more than a year of in-state tuition.White House officials said while the average subsidy for low- and moderate-income families under the federal Child Care and Development Fund was $5,500 in 2013, Mr. Obama\u2019s expansion of the program would aim to cover the entire cost of high-quality care, an average of $10,000. And the number of children covered would nearly double, to 2.6 million in 2025.\u201cI don\u2019t want any family to face the choice between not working or leaving their children in unsafe or poor-quality child care,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The increased subsidies and tax credits would be financed by Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to increase taxes on investments and inherited wealth, as well as a fee on large financial institutions. The preschool initiative would be paid for by increasing tobacco taxes.The proposals are in keeping with the central themes of his Tuesday address, in which he claimed credit for an economic resurgence that he said should usher in a new era of \u201cmiddle-class economics.\u201dIt has met with criticism by Republicans who dismissed it as a typical \u201ctax-and-spend\u201d prescription that would stifle economic growth.The president used his speech to call on Republicans to offer their own ideas about how to finance bipartisan priorities like larger tax credits for research and development and investments in roads and bridges, as well as to help working families afford college and child care.\u201cThe answer can\u2019t just be \u2018no\u2019 to everything,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to say \u2018yes\u2019 to something. I want to get to yes. Tell me what you want to do.\u201dBefore the speech, the president visited with about 50 preschool children at a nearby Head Start center that offers extended care \u2014 from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. \u2014 where he chatted with star-struck 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds who said they recognized him from TV.Kneeling to greet each child, the president said the Dr. Seuss book they were reading, the anti-discrimination parable \u201cThe Sneetches,\u201d should be required reading.\u201cMost of the things I deal with as president would be solved if everybody read about the Sneetches,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there are some people who think they\u2019re special \u2019cause they\u2019ve got stars, and some who feel bad \u2019cause they don\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stimulus for Eurozone, but It May Be Too Little or Too Late", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilThe European Central Bank unleashed a surprisingly aggressive stimulus plan on Thursday that looked like the last, best hope to prevent the region from sliding toward another lost economic decade with the stagnant growth, high unemployment and political strains that it would mean.But the 1.1 trillion-euro question is whether the bond-buying program will jolt Europe out of its economic doldrums or merely create a short-term lift to financial markets. The flood of new money sloshing around the global economy could also create problems elsewhere.\u201cThe E.C.B. will succeed in weakening the euro and maintaining generally low interest rates,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz. \u201cBut this is insufficient to deliver a growth breakthrough,\u201d he added, and \u201ccomes with the risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences.\u201dSince the financial crisis in 2008, nations grappling with economic weakness have repeatedly turned to one tool to try to fix things: the power of their central banks to create new money from thin air and push it into the financial system by buying bonds. Such programs, known as quantitative easing, can help lower long-term interest rates and bolster financial markets, encouraging spending and business investment.The program was bigger than analysts had expected, and the initial market reaction was favorable. Stocks jumped worldwide, and borrowing costs fell, particularly in Europe. The value of the euro \u2014 already dropping precipitously in recent months in anticipation of the move on Thursday \u2014 dropped an additional 2 percent against the dollar to its lowest level since 2003. That should help the E.C.B\u2019s goal of increasing eurozone inflation, and help make the Continent\u2019s exporters more competitive.The success or failure of the program, though, depends on much more than one day\u2019s market moves. And the mixed record of monetary injections elsewhere show the challenges that Mr. Draghi and his colleagues will have turning their fiscal activism into sustained economic improvement. The American and British efforts are generally considered successful, but Japan is struggling with a weak economy and deflation.Mr. Draghi acknowledged that it would take more than an open spigot of money from the central bank to get Europe\u2019s economy on track, and that political authorities across Europe must act as well. \u201cWhat monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth,\u201d he said at a news conference in Frankfurt. \u201cBut for growth to pick up, you need investment. For investment, you need confidence. And for confidence, you need structural reforms.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s now up to the governments to implement these structural reforms,\u201d he said.Then there are the broader risks of such aggressive monetary activism, as trillions of new dollars, pounds and yen have created unpredictable ripple effects worldwide. Even before Europe announced its plans, risks started to surface.Switzerland\u2019s central bank last week abandoned a longstanding peg of the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, concluding that it would be impossible to maintain amid the anticipated E.C.B. action. After dropping the cap, the value of the franc rose 17 percent in a single day, and a Swiss recession may well result.Also Thursday, the Danish central bank cut interest rates, as it faces the challenge of maintaining its own peg between the krone and the euro. It is the country\u2019s second rate cut in a week.Going in the opposite direction, the Federal Reserve is withdrawing its extraordinary stimulus from the United States, helping to drive up the value of the dollar on global currency markets. That could make for more challenging times for American exporters and companies and banks in emerging markets that have borrowed extensively in dollars.Even as the ripples from years of monetary intervention spread through the globe, the biggest uncertainty for Europe is whether the new program will be enough to arrest a slide toward deflation. Analysts have been reluctant to predict too much out of the new program.\u201cQ.E. is not a silver bullet for the eurozone\u2019s many problems,\u201d Howard Archer, the chief European economist for IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note. \u201cBut it should provide some limited help to growth by adding to the stimulus that is already coming from very low oil prices and the markedly weaker euro.\u201dAt first glance, Mr. Draghi\u2019s plan emulates the Federal Reserve\u2019s third and final round of quantitative easing, which is generally credited with helping to accelerate the American economy over the last two years. Both programs were open-ended in size, with billions in monthly bond purchases paired with a pledge to continue until some goal was met. (For the Fed, it was substantial improvement in the job market. For the European Central Bank, returning inflation toward its target).There are two big differences.First, the E.C.B. is late. When the Fed pulled the trigger on its open-ended bond buying, in September 2012, annual inflation was running at 1.6 percent in the United States, not far below its 2 percent target. The economy was growing at a steady if unexceptional rate. The Fed was looking to get ahead of its problem of sluggish growth.The European Central Bank, by contrast, has begun a series of half-measures over the last two and a half years. The contrast has its roots in differing economic analysis about the dangers of deflation and political factors, in particular the aversion of Europe\u2019s central bankers and German political leaders to use the common central bank to share risk among countries.The second big difference with the American program is that the E.C.B. is moving only partway in distributing the risk of losses across the countries that use the euro.The European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt, administers its policies through national central banks across the eurozone: the Bundesbank in Germany, the Banca d\u2019Italia in Italy, and so on. One debate Mr. Draghi and his colleagues had to resolve was whether any losses from government defaults or restructurings on bonds bought through this program would be borne by Europe as a whole or the specific national bank that bought the bonds.Mr. Draghi was dismissive of the importance of this so-called risk mutualization debate in his news conference Thursday. But the plan he unveiled showed the hallmarks of an intricate negotiation to have some elements of risk-sharing and some risk remaining on the books of individual national banks.Mr. Draghi showed guile and savvy in guiding a fractious committee of central bankers to a bigger and more aggressive program than seemed plausible even a few weeks ago. But those compromises, if they are too significant, may undermine his goals, failing to shock decision makers across Europe into a belief that it is riskier to hoard money than to spend and invest it.\u201cI am not sure this is a game changer,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cMonetary policy in itself is one ingredient, not the ultimate solution.\u201dPeter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is at the confluence of the Soca and Idrijca Rivers, and activities in the area include fishing, canoeing and hiking. Just to the north is Slovenia\u2019s only national park, Triglav. Most na Soci is less than 30 minutes\u2019 drive from the Italian border, and about an hour and a half from both Ljubljana and Trieste, Italy. The ski town of Kranjska Gora, on the Austrian border, is also about an hour and a half.MARKET OVERVIEWForeign buyers have gravitated toward the largely car-free old city of Ljubljana, the resort areas around Lakes Bled and Bohinj, the Adriatic coast and the ski areas along the Austrian border to the north. Starting at the low end, buyers can find country homes in need of renovation in the east for well under $100,000, agents said. For $100,000 to $300,000, buyers can choose from among apartments in Ljubljana or small chalets in the Alps or lakes region. Properties priced up to around $1 million include the best city apartments, and luxury homes around the lakes and outside Ljubljana. The very highest prices \u2014 well over $1 million \u2014 are found at the coast. The resulting price drop of 20 to 40 percent, depending on the region, \u201cwas correct,\u201d he said. \u201cI think prices now are correct when you compare them to other European cities.\u201d WHO BUYS IN SLOVENIAThe largest proportion of foreign buyers have traditionally been British, agents said, but Russians now make up a substantial segment of the market. Mr. Young of Slovenia Estates said that about 40 percent of his buyers in the last two and a half years were Russian, but that he expected that number to fall with the slump in Russia\u2019s economy. Smaller numbers of buyers also come from other European countries and the United States.BUYING BASICS\u201cBuying costs are very low here,\u201d Mr. Young said. He and other agents said buyers typically paid half the usual 4 percent commission on transactions. Legal, notary and translation fees usually total about 500 euros, or around $600, he said, depending on the size of the transaction.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSlovenian; euro (1 euro = $1.19)TAXES AND FEESThe annual property taxes are about 300 euros a year, according to Ms. Jakopin.

{"Headline": "For U.S. Stocks, at Least, a Solid Finish", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks ended the fourth quarter of 2014 near record highs, but they traveled a circuitous route to get there \u2014 falling, then soaring, then falling again before making a strong late run. Bonds went in either direction, depending on the quality of the vehicle used for the trip. And in the quarter\u2019s biggest surprise, oil headed due south.Crude oil prices plunged 41.4 percent for the quarter, to end the year at a five-year low after several large producers, first Saudi Arabia and then other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, indicated that they had no intention of curbing production to prop up prices. The move was a reminder of how powerful market forces and the law of supply and demand can be.The Econ 101 refresher course was well timed, nearly coinciding with another significant event: The Federal Reserve signaled to the markets that it would wean them off the stimulus that had helped support them for several years. The central bank suspended its program of bond purchases, or quantitative easing, in October and hinted last month that it would let short-term interest rates rise by midyear.The stock market took the policy changes and oil price decline in stride. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished 2014 at 2,058.90, up 4.4 percent for the quarter and 11.4 percent for the year.The rally helped the average domestic stock fund tracked by Morningstar to rise 4.3 percent in the quarter, but most other broad stock fund categories declined. The average international stock fund fell 2 percent, pulled down by losses of 2.7 percent for portfolios that focus on Europe and 2.3 percent for Asia funds. Diversified emerging-market funds were down 4.9 percent, on average. The declines were attributable partly to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of assets denominated in other currencies. Foreign stock markets did not perform well enough to make up for the weakness in other currencies.Domestic funds were more the exception than the rule for another reason: The United States is seen to stand apart when it comes to economic progress and central bank policies. The American economy has displayed unusual strength, including an upward revision of third-quarter economic growth to a 5 percent annual rate, and the Fed is looking to tighten credit.Japanese and Chinese authorities, by contrast, responded to persistent sluggishness by accelerating bond purchase programs in the fourth quarter or by taking other extraordinary measures. The European Central Bank is expected to follow suit, since the region\u2019s economy remains weak.The United States may be strong enough to support the global economy, some investment advisers say. But it\u2019s also possible that other regions may be so weak that they will drag down the American economy with them.Investors trying to determine which way things will break will receive little guidance from the sharp drop in oil prices, Mr. Inker added. It\u2019s a portentous event for the global economy, but it\u2019s hard to know what it portends.Cheaper oil \u201chas got to be a good thing, net, for most of the developed world and a fair chunk of the emerging world,\u201d he said. But if the decline hints at a deceleration of growth and broader deflation, he warned, \u201cwe\u2019re going to look back and say that the global economy came unstuck in the second half of 2014, but we didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d\u201cWith the U.S. economy still healthy and the eurozone and Japan likely to exceed low economic expectations,\u201d Mr. Baur said, \u201cwe\u2019d suggest overweighting each area\u2019s equities in one\u2019s global portfolio and underweighting the rest of the world.\u201d That would mean emerging markets, which he warned \u201cface significant headwinds in 2015 with tighter Fed policy, a stronger dollar, a slower-growing Chinese economy and local financial stress and squeezed profits.\u201dHis outlook isn\u2019t ideal for the United States, either, in the short run. American stocks could suffer a 15 percent correction early in the year as investors adjust to a less generous Fed, he warned, before bouncing back to end 2015 with a net return in the high single digits.\u201cWe\u2019re still overweight the U.S., with the bulk of exposure in large-capitalization stocks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the dollar rally is over, and to the degree that you get a rally in Europe, you\u2019re going to lose out on the currency. The surprise in 2015 might be not more dollar strength but the degree of dollar strength.\u201d\u201cAbenomics has been a miracle for the corporate sector,\u201d Mr. Vail said. \u201cTaxes have been cut, and profit margins\u201d are rising rapidly, \u201chigher than in 1988.\u201dThe resurgence may have escaped notice because the yen\u2019s decline has limited the rise in Japanese stock prices when expressed in dollars, but Mr. Vail expects the exchange rate to stabilize while profits and stocks will keep rising, creating a sweet spot for investors.Asian stocks in general \u201chave a greater deal to offer\u201d than American ones, as Mr. Vail sees it. He says South Korea, in particular, is \u201cmoving in the right direction.\u201d \u201cI said there wouldn\u2019t be an increase in interest rates in 2014 when the consensus was that the Fed would hike, and they won\u2019t hike this year, either,\u201d he predicted.To show why it won\u2019t need or want to, he highlighted extremely low government bond yields worldwide, which imply that investors foresee almost no inflation for several years. He also pointed to recent weakness in the junk-bond market as a warning for the global economy. Yields have risen on the debt of riskier issuers, especially energy companies suddenly facing lower revenue. \u201cIf we have a series of defaults in the energy sector, there could be spillover effects elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said.Fourth-quarter fund results indicate a flight to safety by bond investors. Funds that hold long-term government issues rose a robust 8.8 percent, but declines in high-yield and emerging-market portfolios left the average bond fund nursing a loss of 0.1 percent.European government bond yields could continue to fall if the European Central Bank picks up where the Fed left off and introduces a bond-purchasing program early this year.\u201cThe eurozone requires a weaker euro for many countries to regain competitiveness, so the E.C.B. is going to start purchasing sovereign paper in the first quarter,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cThere should be one more burst of yield decline.\u201dThe Greek Parliament was dissolved in late December after the ruling party lost a crucial vote. That party backs the austerity program introduced in 2012 as a condition for the debt bailout that kept the country in the eurozone. A general election will be held on Jan. 25, with voters expected to back a coalition led by a party that wants to renegotiate the bailout terms, something that Germany and other large European Union members would probably resist.\u201cThis could get kind of scary,\u201d Mr. Inker said. \u201cFringe parties are getting significant support throughout Europe. If they kick out the elites, it\u2019s not clear what happens.\u201dWhatever impact central bank policies have on the real world, they have worked wonders for the markets. Mr. Sri-Kumar questioned how much more bang the bankers could get for their trillions of bucks.\u201cThey\u2019ve carried the distortion as far as it can go,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks may lose the ability to keep postponing the inevitable through increasing the money supply. If we had normal interest rates, stock and bond prices wouldn\u2019t be where they are.\u201dHe encourages staying in United States Treasury bonds, which he expects to rally, with 10-year yields falling to 1.75 percent from their year-end level of 2.17 percent. European government debt should do well too, in his opinion, but American investors could lose money if the euro continues to drop. As for stocks, he would stick to the safest sectors, including consumer staples, utilities and health care.Mr. Inker agreed that investors should be \u201csomewhat more conservatively positioned than normal.\u201d With American stock and bond prices so high, that means looking abroad, especially to the developing world. But he acknowledged a conundrum: While foreign markets are cheaper, their economies appear more fragile, so it\u2019s hard to know which direction to take.\u201cYou can either have scary stuff that\u2019s cheap,\u201d he said, \u201cor stuff that allows you to sleep at night but where it\u2019s hard to see how you\u2019ll get much return on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Budget Forecast Sees End to Sharp Deficit Declines ", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new budget projections effectively signal the end of the steep decline in deficits as the economy climbed out of the recession. Lawmakers now face a familiar and politically vexing problem: What to do about increases in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spending that reflect the nation\u2019s demographics, not its economic health?\u201cThe past will catch up to us no matter how fast we run from it,\u201d said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.The forecast might not change President Obama\u2019s policy proposals, which will come out on Monday, but it will fortify a Republican Congress\u2019s resolve to pass budgets this spring that would fundamentally reorder health care spending, preserve tough spending caps and force Washington to at least look at Social Security. Democrats will say those spending plans are contradicted by efforts to overhaul the tax code without producing any more tax revenue.And a budget season that will begin in earnest with the release of the president\u2019s tax-and-spending plan for the fiscal year 2016 will underscore a partisan divide over post-recession policy making.The budget office said on Monday that the deficit would fall to $468 billion this year and $467 billion in 2016, or 2.5 percent of the economy, from $483 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. It would be the lowest level since 2007.Then it is projected to rise steadily, to $489 billion in 2017 and $953 billion by 2023. By 2025, the annual deficit will be back over $1 trillion. The budget office forecasts that under current policy, the government will add $7.6 trillion to the $18 trillion federal debt over the coming decade.\u201cSuch large and growing federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing federal spending for interest payments, restraining economic growth in the long term, giving policy makers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges and eventually heightening the risk of a fiscal crisis,\u201d the budget office said.Calling the report a \u201csober reminder\u201d of the nation\u2019s challenges, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and the new House Budget Committee chairman, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason it has to be this way. With innovative thinking, real accountability, and more efficient and effective policies, we can solve our fiscal challenges while restoring strength and confidence to our economy.\u201dThe parties, however, remain deeply divided about the kind of policies that would slow the rise of deficits. Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats and is the new ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, anticipated the change in direction with a new report focused on wage stagnation and the shriveling middle class. The Budget Committee has long been led by senators from both parties who have approached their jobs with a focus on balanced budgets.Mr. Sanders has signaled that he wants to use his post to speak more broadly about the nation\u2019s economic health. His budget report calls for increasing spending on infrastructure and education, protecting Social Security benefits and taxing rising affluence more heavily.\u201cWhile we must continue to focus on the federal deficit, we must also be aware that there are other deficits in our society that have been causing horrendous pain for the vast majority of the American people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThese are deficits in jobs, deficits in infrastructure, deficits in income, deficits in equality, deficits in retirement security, deficits in education and deficits in trade.\u201dThe budget office report had plenty of good news in the short run, even as it tempered it with long-term warnings. The office predicted solid economic growth through 2016, good political news for Democrats as they enter the presidential campaign season. The Democratic candidate to succeed Mr. Obama will likely be able to boast of a steady climb from the recession and unbroken private-sector job growth.But over the medium term, budget office economists are tempering their optimism. In August, they had predicted the gross domestic product to rise an average of 2.7 percent between 2014 and 2018. On Monday, they lowered that forecast to 2.5 percent. Between 2020 and 2025, growth will slow to 2.2 percent, the budget office said, as more baby boomers retire and the economy begins to suffer from fewer workers and higher debt.Already, the national debt, at 74 percent of the economy, is higher than at any time except during and just after World War II. \u201cThere is no denying that substantial fiscal progress has been made in the last few years. But there is equally no denying that we have a ways to go still,\u201d said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution.With no changes in policy, aging baby boomers will take more and more of the federal government\u2019s money, with less and less available for anything else. Social Security spending will rise to 5.7 percent of the economy in 2025 from 4.9 percent next year. Health care spending will rise over that period to 6.2 percent from 5.3 percent, while spending to service the national debt will double, to 3 percent from 1.5 percent.All other spending will shrink to 7.4 percent from 9.2 percent.\u201cThe C.B.O.\u2019s report is clear \u2014 entitlement spending, if not reformed, will drive our deficits and debt to unsustainable levels in the very near future, and unsustainable entitlement spending will continue to crowd out spending in other areas,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cLeaders in Washington must stop turning a blind eye.\u201dHow the parties avoid that situation could dominate much of the political debate over the next two years, as both Republicans and Democrats claim to champion the cause of the middle class, but with very different economic prescriptions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Business Model Could Change Your Work", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut of all the ways that Uber could change the world, the most far-reaching may be found closest at hand: your office. Uber, and more broadly the app-driven labor market it represents, is at the center of what could be a sea change in work, and in how people think about their jobs. You may not be contemplating becoming an Uber driver any time soon, but the Uberization of work may soon be coming to your chosen profession.Just as Uber is doing for taxis, new technologies have the potential to chop up a broad array of traditional jobs into discrete tasks that can be assigned to people just when they\u2019re needed, with wages set by a dynamic measurement of supply and demand, and every worker\u2019s performance constantly tracked, reviewed and subject to the sometimes harsh light of customer satisfaction. Uber and its ride-sharing competitors, including Lyft and Sidecar, are the boldest examples of this breed, which many in the tech industry see as a new kind of start-up \u2014 one whose primary mission is to efficiently allocate human beings and their possessions, rather than information.\u201cI do think we are defining a new category of work that isn\u2019t full-time employment but is not running your own business either,\u201d said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s business school who has studied the rise of the so-called on-demand economy, and who is mainly optimistic about its prospects.\u201cWe may end up with a future in which a fraction of the work force would do a portfolio of things to generate an income \u2014 you could be an Uber driver, an Instacart shopper, an Airbnb host and a Taskrabbit,\u201d Dr. Sundararajan said.\u201cI think it\u2019s nonsense, utter nonsense,\u201d said Robert B. Reich, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley who was the secretary of labor during the Clinton administration. \u201cThis on-demand economy means a work life that is unpredictable, doesn\u2019t pay very well and is terribly insecure.\u201d After interviewing many workers in the on-demand world, Dr. Reich said he has concluded that \u201cmost would much rather have good, well-paying, regular jobs.\u201dDr. Krueger found that at the end of 2014, Uber had 160,000 drivers regularly working for it in the United States. About 40,000 new drivers signed up in December alone, and the number of sign-ups was doubling every six months.The key perk of an Uber job is flexibility. In most of Uber\u2019s largest markets, a majority of its drivers work from one to 15 hours a week, while many traditional taxi drivers work full time. A survey of Uber drivers contained in the report found that most were already employed full or part time when they found Uber, and that earning an additional income on the side was a primary benefit of driving for Uber.Dr. Krueger pointed out that Uber\u2019s growth was disconnected to improvements in the broader labor market. \u201cAs the economy got stronger, Uber\u2019s rate of growth increased,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, it\u2019s not showing signs of limitations in terms of attracting enough drivers.\u201dThe larger worry about on-demand jobs is not about benefits, but about a lack of agency \u2014 a future in which computers, rather than humans, determine what you do, when and for how much. The rise of Uber-like jobs is the logical culmination of an economic and tech system that holds efficiency as its paramount virtue.\u201cThese services are successful because they are tapping into people\u2019s available time more efficiently,\u201d Dr. Sundararajan said. \u201cYou could say that people are monetizing their own downtime.\u201dThink about that for a second; isn\u2019t \u201cmonetizing downtime\u201d a hellish vision of the future of work?The on-demand economy may be better than the alternative of software automating all our work. But that isn\u2019t necessarily much of a cause for celebration.Advertisement"}

Prosecutors say that the municipal police in the southern city of Iguala, in the state of Guerrero, had arrested the students and handed them over to the Guerreros Unidos organized-crime group on orders from the city\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca.Mr. Abarca and his wife, Mar\u00eda de los Angeles Pineda Villa, are believed to be closely linked to Guerreros Unidos. The pair fled Iguala, then were arrested in Mexico City in November. The authorities formally charged Mr. Abarca with kidnapping in the students\u2019 disappearance on Tuesday. At the same time, Ms. Pineda was charged with involvement in organized crime.The case, which peeled back the ways in which drug gangs have succeeded in buying off the local police and officials in many parts of the country, has shocked Mexico and challenged President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts to focus public attention on the economy.Turmoil is rising in Guerrero, where masked antigovernment protesters have burned state buildings and cars and disrupted public events.On Monday, some relatives gathered outside the army base in Iguala, demanding to be allowed to see if their sons were inside. The army has said that it will allow the National Human Rights Commission to visit the base with relatives.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, whom officials described as a Guerreros Unidos hit man, is believed to have ordered the group that killed the students and burned the bodies to remove all traces of the crime. According to the authorities, he took orders from a lieutenant named Gildardo L\u00f3pez Astudillo, who is a fugitive.Almost 100 people have been detained in the investigation so far, officials announced this week.

Chen, Mr. Romney\u2019s top economic adviser in 2012 and now a research fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, said of the president\u2019s proposals for free community college tuition, paid sick leave and middle-class tax cuts financed by higher taxes on the rich. \u201cIn the end, we can\u2019t get into a bidding war with the Democrats, but you are seeing more and more conservatives entering this policy conversation,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a positive thing for the party.\u201dMr. Ryan said accord could be reached on ways to reduce poverty by expanding the earned-income tax credit to childless adults, as he and the president have proposed, and drafting a public works bill aimed at modernizing an aging infrastructure.\u201cI just hope that the tone continues that makes it easier for us to reach common ground,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.But Republicans are divided over whether they need to overhaul their economic policies or merely recalibrate their message.Sean Spicer, communications director for the Republican National Committee, said Republicans needed to do a better job of explaining their policies in an emotional way that shows voters they care about them and understand their life experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want to cut taxes because the math looks better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we want people to make better decisions for themselves and believe they know how to use their money better than the government.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just balancing a budget for the sake of balancing a budget,\u201d Mr. Spicer continued. \u201cIt\u2019s balancing a budget because right now we\u2019re heaping debt and burden onto the next generation, and that\u2019s not fair to them.\u201dThe problem for Republicans, though, is that a debate over wage stagnation and a shrinking middle class plays on Democratic turf, where Democrats can offer up what Mr. Romney once derided as \u201cfree stuff.\u201dRepresentative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, started the bidding this month with an ambitious plan to tax Wall Street financial transactions and raise taxes on the top 1 percent of earners to pay for a \u201cpaycheck bonus credit\u201d of $2,000 a year for couples earning less than $200,000. His plan also calls for a tripling of the tax credit for child care and expanding tax incentives for savers.\u201cThis plays to the Democratic sweet spot,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a commentator at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who writes on economic policy. \u201cThey can say, \u2018Hey, we have a whole set of answers.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRepublicans need a serious response, Mr. Pethokoukis said. Traditional conservative economic theory holds that business expansion creates jobs, tightens the labor market and pushes up wages. Targeting any particular income bracket, this thinking goes, is unnecessary and counterproductive.\u201cRepublicans shouldn\u2019t be afraid to say whatever gains are out there, they\u2019re going to the top 10 percent,\u201d Mr. Pethokoukis said.Only a few Republicans have flirted with the kind of populism Democrats have embraced. Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana conservative, has endorsed being much tougher on the biggest banks, and possibly breaking them up. Dave Camp of Michigan, who retired from the House this year, blazed the trail for Mr. Obama\u2019s bank-tax proposal as part of a larger tax overhaul plan he issued last year as Ways and Means chairman. Republican leaders rejected the proposal.Indeed, most Republican counterproposals have been modest. Mr. Ryan has embraced expanding the earned-income tax credit \u2014 effectively a wage subsidy, first championed by conservative economists like Milton Friedman \u2014 even though Republicans have grown leery of it since Democrats embraced it during the Clinton administration. On Wednesday, Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Representative Martha Roby of Alabama, both Republicans, reintroduced legislation to expand workers\u2019 choice between paid overtime and comp time, a proposal pitched as an assist to working families but opposed by unions as an attack on the 40-hour workweek.Mr. Chen, the former Romney adviser, said conservative economists had focused on wage subsidies through the tax code and more aggressive worker retraining programs through public-private partnerships and apprenticeships. To counter free community college, such economists have suggested offering incentives to universities to make sure students complete their degrees.But such \u201creform conservatism\u201d has a long way to go before being accepted by the dominant players in Republican circles.Mr. Obama is not just pursuing \u201cthe wrong policies,\u201d Speaker John A.

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Lessons for Greece", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe last time Greeks faced a general election, two and a half years ago, the eurozone faced an existential crisis. There were rumors of bank runs in Athens, of pre-emptive Iberian exits from the monetary union, even of Germans unilaterally calling it quits. Greeks are now returning to the polls on Jan. 25 to face choices similar to those in 2012.One beleaguered option is to \u201cstay the course\u201d of their international bailout arrangements and the harsh adjustments they impose. This is the position argued by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. The alternative is \u201canything else\u201d \u2014 a cacophonous policy mix proposed by the main opposition party, Syriza. Depending on whom you ask, this includes a unilateral moratorium on foreign debt and the rollback of the structural reforms that have helped restore international competitiveness and fiscal sustainability.Yet something crucial that has been ignored by most media has changed since 2012. These elections are not about how to manage the economic debacle, but rather about how to steer an incipient recovery. The Greek economy has been growing since the first quarter of last year, according to Eurostat. In the third quarter, the country\u2019s growth was higher than that of any other eurozone member, including Germany. This is not just a rebound: Unemployment has been declining and now stands roughly where it was before the worst point of the crisis two years ago. All this suggests that reforms are belatedly but surely yielding results.Yet with elections just one week away, political risk is back in vogue. Over the last two months, as elections became certain, markets fretted. From the investors\u2019 point of view, the main risk is that the Greeks will opt for a Syriza government, ushering a confrontation with the country\u2019s lenders and a shaky macroeconomic policy plan based on nationalization, forced wage inflation and unaffordable subsidies. Given where polls stand, a Syriza government with some moderating coalition force is the most likely outcome.Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has worked to soften his party\u2019s image since the last elections. A few months ago he could be found at the Ambrosetti Forum on the shores of Lake Como, preaching the values of European integration and the importance of the euro. He has surrounded himself with economists who profess a willingness to come to a \u201cnegotiated solution\u201d with the country\u2019s creditors and who frequently clash with the party rank-and-file who favor unilateral default and \u201cGrexit.\u201d Ultimately, however, there is no way around it: The party\u2019s ideology is hostile to the market economy and the reforms Greece has been implementing.The clearest indication of what Syriza\u2019s policy plan would mean came from Tsipras himself. In September 2012, he stated in the Greek Parliament that he wished the country \u201chad become Argentina.\u201d Back in 2011 economists such as Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman also used Argentina as an example to follow. Even last weekend, in the midst of the campaign, Prime Minister Samaras addressed Argentina and its 2001 debt crisis. So what does it mean to \u201cturn into Argentina?\u201dThe last decade of Argentine economic history offers two valuable lessons for Greece. The first is that Syriza\u2019s threat of a debt moratorium is an empty one: Debts do not go away just because one chooses not to pay them. Witness Argentina\u2019s decade-long legal saga in New York courts. The country\u2019s refusal to pay holdouts of its debt restructuring in 2005 has not ushered in prosperity; it has brought a prolonged legal battle, isolation from world markets, and as of last summer, a second default. There is no reason to believe a unilateral Greek refusal to pay would yield different results.What is more, Greece\u2019s eurozone partners have already said they would consider negotiating on debt relief \u2014 provided Greece sticks to its commitments and negotiates in earnest within the framework of the eurozone. And unlike in 2010, the monetary union now possesses the processes and institutions to deal with fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances in an orderly manner, rather than the ad hoc fashion \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 advocated by Syriza.The second lesson is perhaps more crucial: Economic populism and monetary wizardry are short-sighted. They do not yield development, only isolation and imbalances. In the case of Argentina, after a decade of extremely heterodox policy, citizens have to contend with stagflation \u2014 meaning negative growth and around 40 percent of annual inflation \u2014 capital controls, anachronistic foreign currency controls, and increasingly authoritarian economic management by a government eager to micromanage the behavior of private companies. This is why a country as energy-rich as Argentina finds itself importing natural gas at exorbitant prices just to keep the lights on.No development can be built that way. It is hard to believe that Syriza\u2019s talk of \u201cfree electricity\u201d and a renationalization of the energy market would lead to a better outcome. It should therefore come as no surprise that when Argentines head to their own polls later this year, they will elect a government eager to undo these policies and reintegrate the country into the world.The Greek dilemma is different from Argentina\u2019s in yet another way. Its debt negotiations are not with private holdouts from an imperfect restructuring. They are with fellow eurozone countries, some of which are poorer than Greece, and pay higher interest rates to finance Greek loans. The moral dimension of defaulting on the Slovakian taxpayer \u2014 who has to make do with a much lower minimum wage than his Greek counterpart \u2014 is at least as dishonest as the economic rationale behind Syriza\u2019s plans. The only alternative here is a negotiated way respecting both the existing agreements and European solidarity, a value that may not be financial but is at the cornerstone of the support Greece got at its time of most need.Mr. Tsipras is right about one thing: Argentina offers apt economic parallels for the Greek electorate. But it is an example to avoid, not to follow. Debt default and unilateral withdrawal from the globalized world would not lead Greece to a renaissance. It would lead the country back to ruin. After years of recession and reforms, it would be a sad sight for Greece to follow Argentina, precisely when the former is recovering and the latter is finally about to turn its back on shortsighted populism.Advertisement"}

Hands", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAllies of Senator Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, are moving to impose order on the proliferation of Republican outside groups that have sprung up over the last two years by setting up a \u201csuper PAC\u201d devoted exclusively to helping Republicans keep control of the Senate in 2016.The new group, known as the Senate Leadership Fund, will seek to become the main vehicle for donors who want to help Mr. McConnell\u2019s fledgling majority. The Senate Leadership Fund will work in tandem with American Crossroads, the most prominent Republican super PAC, which is led by Mr. McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, Steven J. Law. Mr. Law will sit on the board of the new organization, and the two groups will coordinate advertising purchases, messaging and fund-raising efforts, though they will not necessarily use the same consultants to create advertising.The new group could also provide Mr. McConnell with a powerful tool for exercising leadership of his caucus. At a private lunch of Senate Republicans on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell praised the new group and described it as a response to concerns donors expressed after the 2014 election, when Senate Republicans did not have the backing of an outside group solely focused on protecting and expanding the Senate\u2019s new Republican majority. Mr. McConnell also signaled that his own leadership PAC would contribute to the Senate Leadership Fund, according to someone with knowledge of the meeting.Strategists involved in setting up the Senate Leadership Fund said it would not rule out intervening in primaries or backing candidates for open seats in its quest to preserve Republican control of the Senate. The party will be defending more than twice as many seats as the Democrats next year, and expects to face a well-financed Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, at the top of the opposing ticket.\u201cOne of the big decisions for party organs is how much do they try to shape what\u2019s going to happen in the general election by getting involved in the primary,\u201d said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who specializes in political advertising.\u00a0\u201cI think you always have to be cognizant of what the competition is doing, and Harry Reid\u2019s had his PAC for a number of years,\u201d said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska.But some Republicans said they believed there was value in having a competitive market for outside spending, with different groups testing strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to install a lot of corporate control as long as you don\u2019t choke off these political entrepreneurs and donors who have gotten into doing their own thing,\u201d said Will Feltus, the senior vice president for research and planning at National Media Inc., a Republican media-buying company.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Committee Hopeful, but Wary at Last Session", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome officials cited the strength of recent economic data, including surveys of consumer and business confidence and the growth of payrolls, as evidence that growth may finally exceed their expectations after years of disappointment.Others said they expected a \u201cquite large\u201d boost from falling oil prices.The signs of newfound optimism were tempered, however, by concern that the weakness of the global economy, and the anemic response of foreign governments, could weigh on domestic growth. And the tone of the December meeting continued a pattern in which the Fed entered almost every year since the financial crisis expressing confidence that the economy was finally gaining momentum.Fed officials saw the woes of other countries as the greatest risk to this forecast, according to the account of the December meeting, which was published after the standard three-week delay.Most officials agreed that falling oil prices would do the domestic economy more good than harm, leading to increased spending and job growth. But they worried about the consequences for foreign economies and the stability of financial markets.\u201cParticipants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment,\u201d the account said. \u201cHowever, many of them thought that a further deterioration in the foreign economic situation could result in slower domestic economic growth than they currently expected.\u201dThe account said these concerns were \u201cnearly balanced\u201d by recent signs that domestic growth \u201cmay end up showing more momentum than anticipated.\u201dThe labor market has grown steadily in recent months, making it easier for Americans to find jobs. The economy added 321,000 jobs in November, the strongest month in nearly three years. The December data will be released on Friday.Falling oil prices, meanwhile, are suppressing price inflation.By the Fed\u2019s preferred measure, inflation was just 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Oil prices have put further downward pressure on inflation. And the meeting account said that \u201ca number of participants\u201d expressed concern that inflation would not rebound to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has established as its target.Yet the account emphasized that most Fed officials remained convinced that inflation will rebound \u2014 and they may begin raising the benchmark interest rate before they are certain.\u201cThe committee might begin normalization at a time when core inflation was near current levels,\u201d the meeting account said, \u201calthough in that circumstance participants would want to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward 2 percent over time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Costs of Stinginess in Medicaid", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIt looks like a straightforward calculation. Arkansas makes it tougher for children to qualify for Medicaid than Vermont does, and it spends much less on each beneficiary. Even though Arkansas\u2019s poverty rate is double Vermont\u2019s, Medicaid\u2019s costs in Arkansas in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, were $600 less per resident than in Vermont.This is not to pick specifically on Arkansas or to extol the virtues of Vermont. The contrast between these two disparate states frames a broader debate about the purpose of the American government. With a new Republican majority in Congress looking to further the cause of low taxes and less spending, it is easy to forget that tightfisted government imposes very real costs. That we can\u2019t easily measure them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.Over the last couple of years, voters have been spared the bitter partisan brawl over taxes and spending that scarred President Obama\u2019s first term in office.Having gained hefty spending cuts \u2014 notably through the process known as sequestration \u2014 Republicans concentrated on other goals, like sinking the Affordable Care Act. Content to have raised some taxes on the wealthiest Americans, the president, too, turned his attention elsewhere.But the fundamental partisan conflict never went away. When the new session of Congress opened last week, Republicans put the fight squarely back on the table.First they got rid of Douglas Elmendorf \u2014 a well-respected economist who, though a Democratic appointee, was widely considered a nonideological shooter \u2014 as the head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Republicans\u2019 underlying assumption is that tax cuts amount to a tonic for economic growth, encouraging investment and toil. Many analyses by the budget office, they argue, misjudge the effect of tax cuts on the budget by underestimating their role as economic stimulus.At the same time, the implicit proposition underlying the Republican case is that public spending amounts at best to money down the drain and, more often, to an albatross around the economy\u2019s neck, discouraging work among beneficiaries of government largess.The evidence for that is even weaker. Under such assumptions, the return to Vermont\u2019s additional Medicaid spending would shrivel to nothing. That is, pretty much, how the budget office scores Medicaid spending today. That truly misjudges the role of government in the long-term health of the American economy.\u201cOf course there are positive returns to spending on health, education, nutrition,\u201d said William Gale, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey are saving a lot of money and generating revenues. The macro effects are big relative to the expenditures.\u201dUsing national data, the researchers estimated that for children born in 1981, Vermont\u2019s more generous eligibility standards would have cost the federal and state governments $4,796 more a child than in Arkansas, measured in 2011 dollars.They also found, however, that easier access to Medicaid translated into more payroll and income taxes when the children grew up. By the time Vermont\u2019s children are 60, Professor Kowalski and her colleagues estimated, they will have repaid 56 cents of each additional Medicaid dollar spent on them when young.There\u2019s more. Healthier children are more likely to become more productive adults who need less government assistance. Children with behavioral problems who receive counseling are less likely to end up in prison \u2014 a big expense line on state budgets.In his recent book \u201cWe Are Better Than This,\u201d Edward D. Kleinbard, former chief of staff of Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, now at the University of Southern California, put it cleanly: \u201cHealthy and adequately nourished citizens are more productive, and will contribute more to the prosperity of society, than will sick and emaciated ones.\u201dNot least, they will probably lead healthier, more satisfying lives. \u201cOne reason for the increased tax payments is that the children survived to pay them,\u201d Professor Kowalski told me.The estimate, however, is not quite hard science. The government invests in all sorts of things \u2014 bridges to nowhere, college education and vital research. Systematically evaluating the long-term return of these endeavors is daunting. Few economists have even tried.So the budget office uses a sort of rule of thumb: It assumes the rate of return to public investment will generally range from zero to the rate of return to private investment, averaging half the private return. This still often undervalues the productivity of what the government does.Most glaringly, government spending not classified as investment \u2014 like Medicaid or food stamps \u2014 is assumed to deliver no economic return at all.Republicans\u2019 attempts to recast budget rules might be portrayed as a political tactic of little consequence \u2014 an assertion of power with no economic or budgetary substance.The stakes are high, though. Under current laws, the C.B.O. has projected that civilian government investment will shrink to roughly 1.3 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product by 2020. That is the smallest share since the government started keeping track in 1962.Federal income support programs like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit are also projected to shrink over the coming decade. And Republicans are unlikely to abandon their long-held plans to cut Medicaid and gut the Affordable Care Act.It\u2019s one thing to shrink a government that is believed to do no good. It would be more difficult if voters understood how much bang they get for the government\u2019s buck.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Invest, or Not, as China Shifts", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 On a tour of central Henan Province in May of last year, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, first raised the notion of the economy adjusting to a \u201cnew normal.\u201d Eight months later, with the economy growing at its slowest pace in more than two decades, it is increasingly clear what this adjustment will mean for China.The leadership in Beijing will tolerate slower growth in order to reduce the economy\u2019s reliance on credit-fueled investment, replacing it with domestic demand as a key driver of growth.The effect of this slowdown on global markets has been drastic. China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer of coal, iron ore and copper \u2014 and the prices of all three have in recent weeks fallen to their lowest levels in more than five years.Less certain, however, is what effect this new normal will have for foreign investors in China. Huge changes now underway are prompting a redefinition of China\u2019s traditional role as the world\u2019s workshop and a magnet for foreign investment.\u201cFor the last 10 to 15 years there was a certain vector to how China was developing, which was export-driven growth; multinationals all coming here; a government that was very encouraging of letting them get business done,\u201d Nitin Nohria, dean of the Harvard Business School, said in an interview last week during a visit to Hong Kong. \u201cThere seems to be a shift, and people are trying to understand what this shift implies.\u201dThe change is being reflected in investment flows to and from China. Last week, the Ministry of Commerce said the growth of foreign direct investment into the country slowed last year, rising just 1.7 percent from 2013 to $119.6 billion. By contrast, outward investment from China surged 14.1 percent to $102.9 billion.Rising wages in China are eroding the country\u2019s competitiveness, and leaders in many provinces and cities are actively discouraging low value added industry from setting up in their jurisdictions. As a result, many manufacturers \u2014 both foreign and Chinese \u2014 have been shifting production to other low cost countries, notably Vietnam, Cambodia and now, Myanmar. In 2013, foreign direct investment into the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations exceeded such investment into China for the first time.At the same time, China\u2019s exports and imports are growing slower, and their makeup is shifting in notable ways. China remains the world\u2019s biggest merchandise trading nation, but the importance of its processing trade \u2014 bringing in materials and components for assembly and export \u2014 has declined in recent years.Li-gang Liu, the chief economist for China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, notes that in 2014, China\u2019s ordinary imports for final consumption accounted for around 57 percent of total imports, and were more than double the amount of its processing imports by value.\u201cThere is still huge room for Chinese consumption to grow rapidly,\u201d Mr. Liu wrote Thursday in a research note. He added, for example, that China\u2019s private consumption represents only 36 percent of its gross domestic product, compared with the world\u2019s average of 60 percent.The risk is that, while China weans itself of credit-driven investment in infrastructure and state-dominated industries, private consumption will not expand quickly enough to pick up the slack.A sharp downturn in overall growth could ensue.While \u201cnew normal\u201d became the buzzword of Chinese officialdom in 2014, almost as frequently mentioned was the idea of a \u201ctriple transition.\u201d Simon Cox, a strategist in Hong Kong at BNY Mellon Investment Management, notes that this triple transition consists of a slowdown in the growth rate, structural reforms to give market forces a greater role in the economy, and finding ways to digest the excess capacity that was created by overinvestment in the past five years.\u201cThe only danger is that the leadership\u2019s preoccupation with this triple transition in 2015 complicates their efforts to shore up demand in the economy, which remains unnecessarily weak,\u201d Mr. Cox wrote Friday in a research report. \u201cChina should accept the new normal of slower trend growth. But in doing so, it should not fall prey to a new subnormal of below-trend growth.\u201dThe danger of growing too slowly, given the high levels of credit in some pockets of China\u2019s economy, is that companies or even local-level governments could have trouble paying their debts and be pushed into default.One such precarious sector is real estate. After a multiyear boom, housing prices in China have been declining in recent months as inventories of unsold homes rise. That is putting pressure on some property developers.This month following the departure of a number of top executives, Kaisa Group, a developer in southern China, defaulted on interest payments on dollar-denominated bonds it had sold to foreign investors. The company has also announced that a number of projects in the southern city of Shenzhen had been suspended by local officials, and that a number of its mainland China bank accounts had been frozen by court orders.The problems at Kaisa have weighed on the prices of offshore bonds issued by other Chinese developers in recent weeks, and last week prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service to downgrade the company\u2019s debt to its second lowest ranking.\u201cThe ratings downgrade reflects our expectation of weaker recovery prospects for Kaisa\u2019s bondholders,\u201d Franco Leung, a vice president at Moody\u2019s, said after the downgrade. \u201cThe increased level of legal actions against the company will further disrupt its operations and will erode its asset values,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Restrained expression? Unhurried, deliberate motion? A searching spirit? Such traits can occur in almost any style, and their use, even in combination, does not necessarily point back to a Japanese style.Maybe by the end of the festival, listeners will have a clearer idea of what specifically characterizes Japanese contemporary music. And maybe not, given the paucity of Japanese instruments.A music review on Monday about the opening concert in the Focus! festival, presented by the Juilliard School, misidentified the conductor who will lead the Juilliard Orchestra in the closing concert of the festival on Friday.

{"Headline": "Peter Praet of E.C.B. Says More Eurozone Stimulus May Be Needed", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A top official of the European Central Bank said in an interview published on Wednesday that measures taken so far to stimulate the eurozone economy might not be adequate and that the central bank might need to do more.The comments by Peter Praet, a member of the central bank\u2019s executive board, strengthened expectations that the central bank is moving closer to broad-based government bond purchases as a way of pumping money into the economy.Added impetus, Mr. Praet said, could come from the additional drag on consumer prices as a result of the recent drop in crude oil prices. While he said that \u201cthe risk of broadly based deflation in the euro area is not high,\u201d he noted that oil\u2019s slump \u201ccould mean negative inflation during a substantial part of 2015.\u201dIn an interview with B\u00f6rsen Zeitung, a German financial newspaper, Mr. Praet said the steps taken so far might not be enough to raise inflation from a level considered dangerously low because it undercuts corporate profits and makes it more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts.Noting that eurozone inflation could be even lower next year than the 0.7 percent forecast by E.C.B. economists, he added, \u201cThis is why we have to be very vigilant and ask ourselves: Have we done enough?\u201dThe statement by Mr. Praet, along with recent signals from other high-ranking E.C.B. officials, suggest that action is increasingly likely at the next monetary policy meeting, on Jan. 22.But the central bank could delay an asset purchase program to bring dissenting members of the policy-making governing council on board, or simply to allow more time to make preparations for what would be a huge and complex intervention in bond markets. Political turmoil in Greece could delay asset purchases, because the E.C.B. might be reluctant to acquire debt that a new Greek government might not repay.Mr. Praet said there was a danger that businesses and consumers were becoming resigned to low growth and low inflation, and as a result were not investing and spending. If so, that would be one of the symptoms of deflation \u2014 a broad-based decline in prices that causes people to delay purchases, company profits to sink and unemployment to rise.European Central Bank policy makers are increasingly worried about \u201cthe very high risk that after seven years of crisis and very poor economic performance in the euro area, businesses and households are reducing their long-term growth expectations and adapting to weak growth and low inflation,\u201d Mr. Praet said.\u201cThe big risk is that this growth pessimism perpetuates the current situation of weak growth and low inflation,\u201d Mr. Praet said.Many economists as well as central bankers in other countries have expressed concern that the E.C.B. has already waited too long to address very low inflation. Prices rose at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the eurozone during November, and some analysts expect inflation to have fallen further during December or even to have turned negative. An official estimate of December inflation will be released on Jan. 7.An asset purchase program in the eurozone would be more complicated than the quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the American economy. The Fed bought large quantities of United States Treasury bonds, but the eurozone has no comparable asset. The E.C.B. would have to buy bonds of individual eurozone countries, which will number 19 when Lithuania joins on Thursday.Mr. Praet said the E.C.B. might buy government bonds in the secondary market in proportion to the size of each country\u2019s outstanding debt. That approach could be controversial, because it would tend to reward the most indebted countries, like Greece and Italy.Mr. Praet acknowledged that the E.C.B. risked rewarding bad behavior, a practice known as moral hazard.\u201cMoral hazard is an issue for monetary policy, I don\u2019t deny that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, it cannot be an excuse not to act if you come to the conclusion that this is needed, given your mandate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auto Leasing Gains Popularity Among American Consumers ", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsJIMMY ZAID says he is always looking for a deal. As he stood in the lobby of a Houston-area Infiniti dealership on the last day of December, he took satisfaction at the one he had just secured on his new sport sedan.Mr. Zaid, a cigar distributor in Friendswood, Tex., had just jumped on a deal he said was too good to pass up: nearly $10,000 in incentives on a new Infiniti Q50 (which lists for about $50,000). Without those incentives, it would have cost him $700 to $800 a month, Mr. Zaid said. His payments? Less than $400 a month.\u201cI\u2019m very happy with the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty blunt when I talk to dealers, I don\u2019t like to play a lot of games. So when they agreed to the lease, I went over the next morning.\u201dBut another dynamic is at work, analysts say: More than a quarter of new-car sales last year were not sales, but leases.The rate of leasing in the United States was higher last year than at any time in more than a decade, according to data provided by Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book.More than one out of every four new vehicles were rented, rather than bought, by American consumers \u2014 and the percentage choosing a lease has risen sharply over just the last two years. It is now roughly 27 percent, up from 22 percent in 2012, according to Edmunds.That is a steady, pronounced shift in the number of consumers choosing to lease cars rather than buy them, and brings to mind the go-go days of the late 1990s, when automakers and private leasing companies offered almost absurdly cheap lease deals to move cars off dealers\u2019 lots. But analysts say this wave of leasing is different in many fundamental ways. In particular, a significant shift in the overall consumer culture is taking place where monthly payments alone are becoming the norm for everything, including cars and buying the latest iPhone.\u201cThe consumer mind-set has shifted in many ways; it\u2019s been driven by this narrow focus on monthly payments, regardless of total cost,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect environment for leases, where auto dealers already try to keep customers\u2019 attention on the monthly payment.\u201dAutomakers are capitalizing on the laserlike focus on monthly payments, and recently have been promoting in particular their lease payments of $199 or less a month. In December, at least 38 vehicles were promoted with lease deals below $199 a month.Luxury automakers have traditionally relied heavily on leases, but Ms. Caldwell said that consumers were increasingly looking to lease lower-end offerings. While in the past their more affordable prices tended to mean more customers opted to buy them, that is changing.Figures from Kelley Blue Book show significant increases in certain mass-market brands. For example, 18 percent of Chevrolet customers opted for a lease last year, up from 15 percent in 2013 and only 10 percent in 2012. Ford\u2019s leasing rates topped 20 percent last year, up from 18 percent the previous year and less than 15 percent in 2012. The Mini brand jumped to 32 percent leases last year from 23 percent leases in 2013.As 2015 begins, Chevy is offering a Cruze to select customers for $159 a month for 36 months. The subcompact Spark can be leased for $179 a month.Over all, according to Kelley Blue Book, nonluxury brands were leased 21.2 percent of the time last year, up from 19.7 percent in 2013 and 16.3 percent in 2012.The picture is more mixed when it comes to luxury cars, which have traditionally been leased more than they have been purchased. Their overall leasing rate ticked up slightly last but remained about the same at roughly half. That is mostly because companies whose leasing rates rose, including Audi, Cadillac, Lexus and Infiniti, were offset by those whose rates fell, including Acura, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover and BMW.Leases are also being driven but another current consumer preference: technology. Unlike in the 1990s, all types of gadgets and gizmos are now available inside a vehicle, including those for entertainment and safety. It is not just that customers are flocking to them; it goes deeper than that. The automobile is evolving from just a machine to take people where they need to go, to a \u201csmartphone on wheels\u201d that is as much about the tech experience as the driving itself.Analysts say that as technology becomes increasingly important, some buyers have started to assess their cars and trucks as they would the latest computer or cellphone \u2014 as a gadget. But the technology packages do not come cheap, and buyers can expect to pay far above the base model price of most cars and trucks to get the best tech features.The lease has offered a solution for many shoppers: a chance to drive home in a vehicle that has the latest technology, while still keeping that monthly payment within reach. And, the thinking goes, in three years, when it is time to return the car, the technology will have advanced so much that it will be time to upgrade. Owners can dump their suddenly obsolete infotainment system for the new version.\u201cWhat\u2019s offered inside a car these days is changing so rapidly that some consumers don\u2019t feel they want to be tied down to one vehicle for the next 10 years,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.A picture caption on the Automobiles page on Friday with an article about the increasing popularity of auto leasing among American consumers misspelled the make of a sedan leased by Jimmy Zaid. As the article correctly noted, it is an Infiniti, not an Infinity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Greek Test", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ColumnistIn the five years (!) that have passed since the euro crisis began, clear thinking has been in notably short supply. But that fuzziness must now end. Recent events in Greece pose a fundamental challenge for Europe: Can it get past the myths and the moralizing, and deal with reality in a way that respects the Continent\u2019s core values? If not, the whole European project \u2014 the attempt to build peace and democracy through shared prosperity \u2014 will suffer a terrible, perhaps mortal blow.First, about those myths: Many people seem to believe that the loans Athens has received since the crisis broke have been subsidizing Greek spending.Or to oversimplify things a bit, you can think of European policy as involving a bailout, not of Greece, but of creditor-country banks, with the Greek government simply acting as the middleman \u2014 and with the Greek public, which has seen a catastrophic fall in living standards, required to make further sacrifices so that it, too, can contribute funds to that bailout. But doesn\u2019t Greece have an obligation to pay the debts its own government chose to run up? That\u2019s where the moralizing comes in.Now, the truth is that nobody believes that Greece can fully repay. So why not recognize that reality and reduce the payments to a level that doesn\u2019t impose endless suffering? Is the goal to make Greece an example for other borrowers? If so, how is that consistent with the values of what is supposed to be an association of sovereign, democratic nations?The question of values becomes even starker once we consider why Greece\u2019s creditors still have power. If it were just a matter of government finance, Greece could simply declare bankruptcy; it would be cut off from new loans, but it would also stop paying off existing debts, and its cash flow would actually improve. The problem for Greece, however, is the fragility of its banks, which currently (like banks throughout the euro area) have access to credit from the European Central Bank. Cut off that credit, and the Greek banking system would probably melt down amid huge bank runs. As long as it stays on the euro, then, Greece needs the good will of the central bank, which may, in turn, depend on the attitude of Germany and other creditor nations.But think about how that plays into debt negotiations. Is Germany really prepared, in effect, to say to a fellow European democracy, \u201cPay up or we\u2019ll destroy your banking system?\u201d And think about what happens if the new Greek government \u2014 which was, after all, elected on a promise to end austerity \u2014 refuses to give in? That way, all too easily, lies a forced exit of Greece from the euro, with potentially disastrous economic and political consequences for Europe as a whole.Objectively, resolving this situation shouldn\u2019t be hard. Although nobody knows it, Greece has actually made great progress in regaining competitiveness; wages and costs have fallen dramatically, so that, at this point, austerity is the main thing holding the economy back. So what\u2019s needed is simple: Let Greece run smaller but still positive surpluses, which would relieve Greek suffering, and let the new government claim success, defusing the anti-democratic forces waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, the cost to creditor-nation taxpayers \u2014 who were never going to get the full value of the debt \u2014 would be minimal.Doing the right thing would, however, require that other Europeans, Germans in particular, abandon self-serving myths and stop substituting moralizing for analysis. Can they do it? We\u2019ll soon see. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All About the Middle Class: Obama\u2019s Goal for the Speech", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the UnionMiddle class.Middle class, middle class, middle class.Since 2000, the weekly median earnings of full-time workers have not even kept pace with inflation. Meanwhile, the per capita output of the American economy has risen 14 percent in the same span. But the benefits of that economic growth have largely flowed to corporate profits and to the salaries of affluent workers.\u201cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d Mr. Obama plans to say, according to excerpts released by the White House. \u201cThe verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works.\u201dIt\u2019s especially instructive to note one policy area that the White House has not been emphasizing through its prespeech announcements: the minimum wage. Mr. Obama favors an increase in the minimum wage and seems likely to mention it in the speech. But administration officials know that most middle-class families do not see the minimum wage as relevant to their lives \u2014 and thus have not made it a focus of their message.Administration officials also know that a Republican Congress is unlikely to pass many of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals. But they see three potential benefits to the middle-class emphasis.One, the White House knows that Mr. Obama is closer to public opinion on some of these issues than Republicans are. By making the case for a middle-class tax cut or free community college, he is helping setting the agenda for the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 a campaign that will determine how many of his policies are continued and how many are reversed.Finally, administration officials hold out hope that Congress may ultimately incorporate some of his proposals into a larger bill, perhaps as part of a negotiation over a budget bill. Some of the middle-class tax cuts, in particular, seem to be a candidate.Just a couple of years ago, the prospect of even a limited compromise might have seemed remote \u2014 because the two parties would have had to agree on a way to pay for a tax cut or new program. But the unexpectedly rapid fall in the federal deficit has changed the politics here.The way that Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans may be able to find modest ground is to agree not to pay for their programs after all \u2014 and instead to let the deficit rise a bit. In the public\u2019s mind, the deficit has receded as a political priority, while the state of the middle class has, if anything, grown more important. Those middle-class concerns are the dominant backdrop for tonight\u2019s speech.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Falling Euro Fans Fears of a Regional Slowdown", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The value of the euro fell to its lowest level in years on Monday, prompting sharp declines in European stocks and creating uneasiness about whether the region is on the verge of a new economic and financial crisis.The continued plunge, to a nine-year low against the dollar, came on the same day that global oil prices also resumed their descent, hitting prices not seen in more than five years. While cheap oil can be a good thing for consumers and energy-intensive industries, the growing worry is that the decline signals lower demand and portends a global economic slowdown.In Europe, \u201cthere\u2019s probably as much fear as 2012,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, referring to a period when worries were rampant that the euro currency union would unravel.Mr. Paulsen said such worries were misplaced. And in fact there should be a lot for Europeans to like about the drop in oil prices and Monday\u2019s decline of the euro to $1.19 \u2014 a 15 percent fall against the dollar since May.Products from the eurozone will become more affordable to foreign buyers, even as the energy needed to make those products becomes cheaper. Mr. Paulsen and some other economists said that can only quicken the eurozone\u2019s lethargic economic pulse. New data on Monday from Germany showed that inflation in the eurozone remains at worrisomely low levels, the latest sign of a despondent economy.Other economists say that while the net effect is positive, much of the benefit may be canceled out by negative consequences \u2014 for example, a slump in world demand for exports, including from the eurozone.And one reason for the continued decline in the euro is the much more robust growth of the United States economy, which is prompting global investors to dump euros in favor of dollars.\u201cI\u2019m taking this quite cautiously,\u201d Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura, said of oil prices. \u201cIf oil weakness is due to lower demand, we should be very worried.\u201dEuropean stock markets reflected that worry on Monday, led by a sell-off in shares of energy companies that carried over to the United States when Wall Street opened.At least initially, investors reacted to the new dips in the euro and oil prices with alarm. The benchmark stock indexes in France, Italy and Germany all fell more than 2 percent. Energy-related stocks were among the biggest losers. The German electricity suppliers E.ON and RWE and chemical maker BASF all fell more than 4 percent.The further declines in the euro and in oil did not change expectations that when the European Central Bank meets on Jan. 22 that it would unveil further stimulus, broad-based purchases of government bonds, so-called quantitative easing.When deciding policy, E.C.B. officials are probably focused on the inflation rate more than the value of the euro or the price of oil, and the German data indicated that inflation continues to fall to levels considered dangerously close to deflation \u2014 a downward price spiral that is poisonous for corporate profits.German inflation was just 0.1 percent in December, according to an estimate by the government statistics office.An official estimate of inflation in the eurozone as a whole is to be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the rate to fall to close to zero or even below it, putting further pressure on the European Central Bank to act.The fate of the eurozone economy depends on which school of economic thought turns out to be right, something that probably will not become clear for several months.Eurozone companies that earn revenue in dollars will enjoy a surge in profits, said Mr. Cailloux of Nomura, simply because dollar sales will translate into more euros in the quarterly earnings report. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow, he said, that companies will use the profits to expand European operations and help cut the eurozone\u2019s 11.5 percent unemployment rate.There are still many economists and public officials, though, who maintain that in fact cheap oil and a cheap currency are overwhelmingly good for Europe. One of them is Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.\u201cThe cheaper oil price works like a stimulus program,\u201d he said in an interview published Sunday by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. \u201cConsumers and companies have to spend less and can consume and invest more.\u201dThe statement was a signal by Mr. Weidmann that he remains skeptical about whether more E.C.B. stimulus wasneeded.While a majority of the E.C.B. Governing Council appears to support embarking on a quantitative easing program, members may be reluctant to risk alienating Mr. Weidmann and the larger German public whose views he represents. Germany worries that it might get stuck paying a big part of the bill if the European Central Bank loses money on any eurozone government bonds it might buy as part of quantitative easing.Whether cheap oil and a weak euro help Europe may depend on how long the low prices last. If companies believe that low prices are temporary, they may be in no hurry to invest in expansion and hiring more people.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any change in the market behavior of our customers,\u201d Wolfgang Bernhard, chief executive of Daimler Trucks and Buses, said in an emailed statement. \u201cSo far no one believes that the prices will stay so low forever.\u201dThere is also the fact that eurozone countries tend to be net importers of oil and natural gas \u2014 which is usually priced in dollars \u2014 meaning that their weak currency may not buy as much fuel in the future.Still, gasoline prices for European consumers are significantly lower than they were a few months ago. Pump prices in Germany are down 9 percent since June.Whether economists believe that cheap oil will be good for Europe often depends on how they explain why oil is cheap.Mr. Cailloux cites weak demand as an important cause, which is bad news for the eurozone because of the region\u2019s dependence on trade. He also pointed out that oil-producing countries are important customers for goods from Germany and other eurozone countries.\u201cThe demand from recycling those petrodollars is going to be weaker,\u201d Mr. Cailloux said. \u201cRussia comes to mind.\u201dThose who contend that oil is cheap because of abundant supply are more optimistic. Mr. Paulsen of Wells Fargo belongs to that camp.He argued that the eurozone was poised to benefit from a virtuous combination of low interest rates on loans, cheap oil and a competitive boost from the weak euro.\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to find out Europe bounces this year rather than melts away.\u201dMr. Paulsen said some of the declines in European stock prices on Monday were a beginning-of-year correction after big gains in 2014. But he conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s just panic at the moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ambassador for Physics Is Shifting His Mission", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2009, when he took over, dark clouds were hanging over CERN, the world\u2019s largest physics lab.Now he looks fondly on those days. \u201cIf you start with such a low point, you can show your team was able to bring everything out of a low point up to a high point,\u201d he said.Dr. Heuer, 66, is entering the last year of his term; in 2016, Fabiola Gianotti, an Italian particle physicist, will take over as the director. Dr. Heuer will become the director of the German Physical Society.CERN, formed after World War II to rekindle European science, now has 21 member states. The newest, and the only one outside Europe, is Israel. The United States, which has observer status at CERN, is not a member but played a big role in building and operating the Large Hadron Collider.In December, Dr. Heuer went to Islamabad to sign up Pakistan as an associate member. He said his long-term dream was a network of international labs, \u201cislands where people can work together independently of the political situation in their home country.\u201dDr. Heuer, born in Bad Boll in southern Germany in 1948, has spent his career in the trenches of particle physics, in which scientists emulate 3-year-olds by smashing bits of matter together to see what comes out.He has no heroes, but said he had learned the ropes from his teachers. One indelible moment came when his Ph.D. supervisor at the University of Heidelberg, Joachim Heintze, tore up the first draft of his dissertation, saying it was too detailed. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Dr. Heuer said. \u201cA clear string of logic was missing. And that was the last time it was missing.\u201dHe went on: \u201cIt was a memorable meeting. Since then, I propagate that message: When you have a problem, make sure you speak it out, and then it is forgotten.\u201dDr. Heuer was criticized for letting CERN be used as a platform for a result everybody believed was probably wrong. (The researchers later realized they had plugged their equipment together wrong.) In the end, Dr. Heuer said, nobody was fooled and the kerfuffle was fun, an example of the scientific process. Given the choice now, he said, he would do it again.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to the director-general to act like a censor if the result is against what everyone believes,\u201d he said.The neutrino controversy helped set a sort of dubious stage for the main event in particle physics so far this century: the Higgs boson.Energy is the coin of the particle physics realm. The more energy with which two particles can be collided and transformed, the more intimately nature can be studied. The Large Hadron Collider was designed to be powerful enough to shake loose the Higgs boson.\u201cI think everybody was surprised it went so fast,\u201d Dr. Heuer said of the Higgs hunt, especially because the collider had to be operated at only half its capability to avoid straining its circuits after the 2009 explosion.It will start up again in March, running close to full strength for the first time, with proton bullets of 6.5 trillion electron volts \u2014 enough energy, scientists hope, to break into new ground.\u201cAt the beginning, everyone was assuming supersymmetry was around the corner,\u201d Dr. Heuer said, \u201cand it would be the first thing to be detected.\u201d It was not, nor has any deviation from the Standard Model predictions for the Higgs yet been recorded, disgruntling many theorists who hoped for a clue to the next great theory.Dr. Heuer is not among them \u2014 yet. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to be disappointed by something nature has given us,\u201d he said.\u201cOn the one hand, it is fantastic how well the Standard Model works,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s frustrating how it holds against all precision tests.\u201d\u201cIf nothing shows up in the next runs, then one has to scratch the head,\u201d he said.The CERN collider has years yet to run, but the world\u2019s physicists are already pondering even bigger colliders. Last summer, Chinese physicists announced a proposal to build a pair of colliders 32 miles around, twice as big as CERN\u2019s. With international support, they said, the machines could be scaled up to reach energies of 100 trillion electron volts. Not to be outdone, CERN scientists have suggested tunneling under Lake Geneva to build a supercollider. Japan is also interested in having a Higgs factory built there.It takes more than national pride and curiosity to build a multibillion-dollar particle accelerator. The Large Hadron Collider, Dr. Heuer said, had a natural justification: It would be powerful enough to find the Higgs boson, or whatever else made particles have mass.\u201cIt was a no-lose theorem,\u201d he said.Without a clearer theory about how nature works at higher energies, however, there is no specific prediction for bigger machines to test. The energy value of 100 trillion electron volts, he conceded, is just a nice round number.\u201cThis no-lose scenario does not exist for 100 TeV,\u201d he said. To propose a new machine without such a killer app, he said, \u201cyou have to have a very good argument you can explain in a relatively clear-cut way.\u201dCan that be done? Do taxpayers and everybody else have a hope of understanding what the physicists are doing?\u201cThat depends on your effort, sir,\u201d he answered.\u201cThe math behind it \u2014 forget it, even for me,\u201d said Dr. Heuer, admitting that he is not fluent in quantum field theory, the body of math from which the Higgs springs. \u201cI\u2019m not a theorist.\u201dBut he went on, \u201cThe answer is yes: You should be able to understand at least the logic behind it. You can explain to interested laymen.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will forget it two hours later. I know how it is when I learn something new.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about Rolf-Dieter Heuer, the director-general of the European Organization of Nuclear Research, or CERN, misstated the anniversary the organization celebrated last year with events at the United Nations General Assembly. It was CERN\u2019s 60th anniversary, not its 50th.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle Class Shrinks Further as More Fall Out Instead of Climbing Up", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the late 1960s, more than half of the households in the United States were squarely in the middle, earning, in today\u2019s dollars, $35,000 to $100,000 a year. Few people noticed or cared as the size of that group began to fall, because the shift was primarily caused by more Americans climbing the economic ladder into upper-income brackets.But since 2000, the middle-class share of households has continued to narrow, the main reason being that more people have fallen to the bottom. At the same time, fewer of those in this group fit the traditional image of a married couple with children at home, a gap increasingly filled by the elderly.The share of the American population that is middle income has been shrinking for several decades. Until fairly recently, that was because more people were entering a higher-income bracket. Now it\u2019s for the opposite reason.\u201cMiddle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change,\u201d Mr. Obama told Congress and the public on Tuesday.Still, regardless of their income, most Americans identify as middle class. The term itself is so amorphous that politicians often cite the group in introducing proposals to engender wide appeal.The definition here starts at $35,000 \u2014 which is about 50 percent higher than the official poverty level for a family of four \u2014 and ends at the six-figure mark. Although many Americans in households making more than $100,000 consider themselves middle class, particularly those living in expensive regions like the Northeast and Pacific Coast, they have substantially more money than most people.However the lines are drawn, it is clear that millions are struggling to hang on to accouterment that most experts consider essential to a middle-class life.\u201cI would consider middle class to be people who can live comfortably on what they earn, can pay their bills, can set aside something to save for retirement and for kids in college and can have vacations and entertainment,\u201d said Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a left-leaning research and advocacy group.Her circumstances are a stark change from just a few years ago, when she considered herself firmly in the middle class. Despite a relatively modest salary, her pay and other resources went a long way in tiny Eden, N.C., where she worked for 13 years in customer service at a textile factory.In 2008, however, Ms. Land was laid off. Faced with ailing parents and a recession that tore up the region\u2019s economy, she moved in with her father to offer full-time care.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have a lot of money, but we had everything that we needed,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s really no extra for anything. No vacation. No dining out. No stuff like that.\u201dEven as the American middle class has shrunk, it has gone through a transformation. The 53 million households that remain in the middle class \u2014 about 43 percent of all households \u2014 look considerably different from their middle-class predecessors of a previous generation, according to a New York Times analysis of census data.In recent years, the fastest-growing component of the new middle class has been households headed by people 65 and older. Today\u2019s seniors have better retirement benefits than previous generations. Also, older Americans are increasingly working past traditional retirement age. More than eight million, or 19 percent, were in the labor force in 2013, nearly twice as many as in 2000.As a result, while median household income, on average, has fallen 9 percent since the turn of the century, it has jumped 14 percent among households headed by older adults.Married couples with children \u2014 who make up a category that is shrinking over all \u2014 are diminishing even faster as a share of the middle class. In the late 1960s, about 45 percent of all households included married adults and their offspring. But among middle-class households, more than 60 percent had that traditional family arrangement.Today, married couples with children at home make up just a quarter of households. But even as they diminished as a share of the population, these families surged up the economic ladder as more married women went to work in the paid labor force. By 2000, 42 percent earned more than $100,000 in today\u2019s dollars.The most recent recession put a halt to the advances of even that generally successful group. Its share in the middle class has fallen by three percentage points and the share earning less than $35,000 has increased.\u201cIn the Great Recession, we lost a lot of middle-income jobs and we gained a lot of low-paying jobs,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, resident scholar at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThat\u2019s a slower-burning thing, but it increased in ferocity during the recession, and people are feeling it.\u201dFor more than two decades, John D\u2019Amanda, 54, earned about $30,000 a year running a window-washing service in Oakland, Calif. He had a car and an apartment. Then, in 2009, the calls stopped coming in. His customers no longer had the luxury of paying for someone to wash their windows.Mr. D\u2019Amanda got a job at a McDonald\u2019s, where he has worked ever since, now earning 25 cents above the state\u2019s new minimum wage of $9. He pays $350 a month in rent to share a small bedroom with a roommate.\u201cI\u2019m barely able to afford that,\u201d he said.These days, most middle-class adults reached their status through higher education. As recently as 1992, half of all middle-class households were headed by someone with a high school education or less, according to the Times analysis. Today, only 37 percent of the middle class has not been to college.See how your household income ranks in 344 zones across the United States.Geography also matters. The biggest declines in middle-class households during the previous half-century occurred in the Northeast \u2014 states like Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey \u2014 where industrial economies gave way to mass suburbanization and increased affluence.\u201cThe middle has basically stayed the same; it hasn\u2019t improved,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard University. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an iPhone now and a better TV, but your median income hasn\u2019t changed. What\u2019s really changed is the penthouse has become supernice.\u201dStill, there are some recent signs of hope for the middle class. The economy is improving and more jobs are being created, many of them in better-paying categories like professional services, health care and even a reviving manufacturing sector.Jason Pappas\u2019s prospects, for example, are looking up. Mr. Pappas, 32, from Muncie, Ind., was earning about $42 an hour as an iron worker in the mid-2000s, but building projects dried up during the recession, pushing him onto the unemployment rolls for a year and a half.He eventually found a job as a truck driver. Today, he earns just over half the hourly wage he made as an iron worker, but he is happy to have a steady job.\u201cIt pays the bills,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have medical insurance.\u201dMoreover, Mr. Pappas just learned that he was being promoted to supervisor. Soon, with overtime, he\u2019ll be earning $80,000 a year.He is feeling a lot better about his future. \u201cHard work pays off,\u201d Mr. Pappas said.Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Mu\u00f1oz, a publicist for designers, lives in a 4,300-square-foot penthouse apartment with glass walls and luscious green views. The home has richly grained wood floors, trim modern sofas and a kitchen island you could sacrifice an ox on.\u201cIf I was going to Mexico, I wanted to be on the water, but that house is completely amazing,\u201d said Ms. Frisk, a graphic designer and design consultant in the West Town neighborhood of Chicago.Ms. Frisk had planned to travel over Thanksgiving and couldn\u2019t make the timing work for the Mexico City dream loft (she ended up in the Berlin abode of two architects). Now she\u2019s trying to arrange to stay there with a group of friends.\u201cIt feels a lot more spontaneous planning a vacation around the home than doing all the research about where you want to go,\u201d she said.Like other home-swapping sites, Behomm (pronounced \u201cbe HOME\u201d) allows its members to trade properties, simultaneously or at different times. No money changes hands, as with Airbnb. The conditions for bartering are worked out in advance, and the reciprocal arrangement helps visits run smoothly.Arriving at their destination, guests may find wine chilling in the refrigerator, a car at their disposal and a pet waiting to be fed. The principle is mutually assured protection: Do unto another\u2019s B&B Italia sofa as you would have someone do unto yours.What makes Behomm different (and a likely harbinger of home-exchange sites to come) is its peer-to-peer network. All its members are visual artists, designers or allied professionals. To join, they must work in one of 98 creative disciplines listed on the application, from animator to window dresser.And they must have a great-looking place. The landing page at behomm\u00ad.com features, among other beauties, a fashion designer\u2019s Danish beach cottage, a photographer\u2019s 1920s Milanese flat and an architect couple\u2019s rustic (but not really) house in the Iron Horse neighborhood of Tucson.Given the expertise of Behomm\u2019s members, such stylishness is almost a foregone conclusion. Or so the founders believe.\u00ad\u2022Behomm was created by Eva Calduch and Agust Juste, both 48-year-old graphic designers in Barcelona, Spain. The couple, longtime home exchangers, had become tired of slogging through the tens of thousands of entries on popular sites like HomeExchange\u00ad.com.\u201cWe were wasting hours and hours,\u201d Ms. Calduch said. Then one day they found an architect\u2019s stunning apartment overlooking a seaport on the Balearic island of Minorca and realized that they ought to concentrate on the residences of their peers.They began swapping with landscape architects, photographers and interior designers, and a network started, one that became the foundation of Behomm.The first 300 people to join were offered free lifetime memberships (like many home-exchange sites, Behomm charges annual dues). Even now, new members have a year\u2019s free trial before they pay a fee of 95 euros (about $113).The site has some 1,200 members, with Spain and the United States supplying the most \u2014 about 200 each. The locations are as far-flung as Bali and Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil. Even Japan has four subscribers. (A remarkable number, Ms. Calduch said, considering that a Japanese colleague told her, \u201cWe don\u2019t even invite friends over.\u201d)Around 10 to 20 percent of applications are rejected, often because the homes are shown to be messy or dirty. As for the rest, choices are based on \u201csubjective aesthetics,\u201d in Ms. Calduch\u2019s words. Those decisions have nothing to do with size or luxury, she added: \u201cA tiny place with very little can be nicer or more tasteful than a castle.\u201dNathalie Golliet, a designer in Paris who organizes culinary events, was one of the first to join. \u201cI remember well, because I have the number 26,\u201d she said.She has made four swaps since becoming a member, including one in Marrakesh, Morocco, with Fran\u00e7oise Lefebvre, who shares her interest in food.Each woman was impressed with the other\u2019s well-equipped kitchen. Ms. Golliet even learned how to prepare Moroccan dishes from a cook Ms. Lefebvre sent over while Ms. Golliet was staying at her house.\u2022\u00adTrust is fundamental to home exchange, and it is easier to come by in small communities with common interests.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at the Stern School of Business at N.Y.U., who researches the digital sharing economy, said social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, and tools that verify one\u2019s real-life identity, now allow us to vouch for a person\u2019s credibility and good intentions.Trust can be cultivated even in high-stakes situations like \u201cletting a stranger into your bedroom,\u201d he said, or in the case of long-distance ride-sharing programs like carpooling\u00ad.com, \u201cletting a stranger drive you to a strange city.\u201d This makes the time ripe for a peer-to-peer home-swapping venture that draws new people in.For their part, Behomm\u2019s members spoke of the comfort they found in their intimate network, the novelty of stepping into one another\u2019s shoes and the value of acquaintances that bloom into friendships or business opportunities.\u201cIt goes way beyond sharing a home \u2014 you share your lives,\u201d said Alex Trochut, a graphic designer and illustrator who lives in New York and Barcelona. Mr. Trochut described the Behomm experience as the \u201cvery opposite of Airbnbn, because you feel entitled to things when you pay for them. This is about giving and not receiving.\u201dCan it really be that good? Ms. Calduch said that she has refereed only two small conflicts in the last year and a half. One involved cleaning. \u201cThere was a misunderstanding,\u201d she recalled. The other had to do with confusion over which of a member\u2019s multiple homes was being offered.To fend off squabbles, she supplies forms that allow users to specify all the terms for an exchange, including stipulations for purging cat hair and sharing toys. Still, conversations with some Behomm members suggested ample room for dispute.For instance, Wendy Rommers and her husband, Bas van Schelven, often swap their primary residence near Amsterdam, which is a houseboat.Ms. Rommers, who is a multidisciplinary designer (Mr. van Schelven owns the company that makes the boats), said that the vessel doesn\u2019t have particular maintenance needs, though she advises keeping the water running on freezing nights. As for safety, there are life jackets, \u201cand things you can throw into the water\u201d that a drowning person might grasp. She made no mention of liability insurance.Indeed, one of the few negative anecdotes came from Mr. Trochut, and he was the cause of havoc. While he and a girlfriend were staying in Copenhagen in 2008, his companion had an asthma attack that put her in the hospital.His hosts were so helpful in advising the couple on medical care that Mr. Trochut decided to repay them by washing the bed linens. Eager to finish before they returned home, he set the washer at the highest speed, which produced vibrations that caused the machine to tumble onto the adjacent bathroom sink, crushing the perfume bottles lined up there.Mr. Trochut discovered the carnage just as his hosts walked in. \u201cWe got to an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cI paid for everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Across the New York Area, Restoring \u2018Wonder Theater\u2019 Movie Palaces to Glory", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReports of the theater opening describe an eight-foot, 150-year-old French Buhl clock, Dresden porcelain vases from the Vanderbilt mansion, bronze statues from France, crimson curtains embroidered with gold griffins and a turquoise-tiled Carrera marble fountain filled with goldfish. And that was just the lobby.The Kings and the Jersey are two of the five \u201cWonder Theaters\u201d built in the New York area by the Loew\u2019s Corporation in 1929 and 1930. The other three, currently managed by religious groups, are the Valencia on Jamaica Avenue in Queens, the United Palace on 175th Street and Broadway in Manhattan and the Paradise on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.\u201cThe wealthy,\u201d he said, \u201crub elbows with the poor \u2014 and are better for this contact.\u201dWhether the rich and poor will mingle at the Kings in Brooklyn \u2014 and whether the newly refurbished theater will alter the local economy \u2014 remains to be seen. But there clearly has been an effort.The renovation effort was herculean, according to Mr. Martinez. When it started two years ago, he said, workers discovered that water had corroded vast sections of decorative plaster, carpets squished underfoot, light fixtures had been torn from the walls, pigeons roosted in the ceiling and a naked man was found curled up on the stage, alive but startled when police officers and two workers woke him.But the Wonder Theaters were of a higher caliber. Designed by world-class architects, the theaters flouted the tedium and hopelessness of the Great Depression \u2014 and later the anxieties of World War II \u2014 by providing the common citizen with an affordable escape into Hollywood fantasy and luxurious surroundings.At a Wonder Theater, local kids could spend an afternoon submerged in fantasy for a small portion of their allowance. For a few of them, the experience possibly served as inspiration: Frank Sinatra saw Bing Crosby sing at the Jersey; Stanley Kubrick saw his first blockbusters at the Paradise; and Barbra Streisand regularly attended Saturday matinees at the Kings.The theaters also served as community centers. According to The Brooklyn Eagle, the Kings held fashion shows for local merchants, bridge lessons for older people and Christmas parties for orphans. Its ushers even fielded a basketball team against ushers from other Brooklyn theaters, practicing on an indoor court in the Kings basement. The court was replaced by bathroom stalls in the recent renovation.Beginning in the 1960s, middle-class families moved to the suburbs and the neighborhoods declined, as did the Wonder Theaters. The advent of television made selling 3,000 tickets to a single screen difficult. The age of the multiplex arrived, and theaters around the country, including the Jersey and the Paradise, were robbed of their grandeur by division: first as duplexes, then as triplexes and sometimes as quads.As these neighborhoods and their Wonder Theaters struggled economically, peddlers of storefront salvation moved in. Empty theaters were seen as ideal modern temples for some affluent churches, whose religious status exempted them from taxes on the mammoth properties.The ministry made some changes, notably creating a gallery of discarded crutches and casts in the lobby as evidence of healing miracles. A row of nude Roman gods atop the proscenium ran counter to the church\u2019s strict Pentecostalism, so they were wrapped in cloaks and fitted with wings.But most of the theater was, to the relief of conservationists, maintained.\u201cWe want that building to stay the way we found it,\u201d said Priscilla Cyrus, a minister and longtime board member of the church. \u201cLoew\u2019s thought it was their theater, but it was like it was created for us.\u201dToday the Valencia is empty most of the time. The church still owns and manages the space, though its congregation has shrunk from 7,000 members to about 300, according to Ms. Cyrus.She also said that the theater required a new heating and air-conditioning system that would cost about $400,000. For now, services are being held in the basement of an office building. The church refuses to raise money by renting the theater for concerts or functions, concerned that third parties would not share the moral strictures of its members\u2019 faith. As a result, no secular performer has appeared on the Valencia\u2019s stage in more than 30 years.At the United Palace on 175th, Reverend Ike\u2019s son Xavier Eikerenkoetter is now the head of the church, whose congregation, like the Tabernacle\u2019s, is dwindling. But unlike the Valencia and the Paradise, there is a mutually beneficial agreement in place at the Palace.\u201cThis was built as the place for the neighborhood to congregate,\u201d said Mike Fitelson, executive director of the United Palace of Cultural Arts. \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to drag this beauty into the 21st century.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening at the United Palace is the sort of balance of profit and nonprofit, corporate and community, that the Friends of the Loew\u2019s has been describing as its vision for the Jersey.Founded by Colin Egan and Patti Giordan, Friends of the Loew\u2019s saved the building from demolition in the 1980s and convinced the city to buy it. Since then, the organization has managed to partially restore the building to just the right side of operational.When the lights were first turned back on, fuses \u201cpopped like popcorn,\u201d Mr. Egan said. The projection booth was a guano-encrusted pigeon coop. Thick deposits of orange nicotine had to be scraped from the plaster. Layers of paint, laid in the days when the bathrooms were graffiti canvases, were patiently stripped from marble fixtures. The laborious process of renovating the seats continues today. The Jersey now holds regular screenings, community events and private functions, all organized by the Friends. In the coming months the theater will host, among other things, an Egyptian cultural conference, several weddings and a local theater company\u2019s play about Nelson Mandela.\u201cYou look at the numbers that they did last year and I think it was approximately 10,000 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat theater\u2019s capable of 10,000 people in a weekend.\u201dHe said he wanted the Friends group to be part of the process of restoring the theater. \u201cBut at the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t responsibly put in $40 million and turn the keys over to somebody that doesn\u2019t have a proven track record in managing a venue that size on a consistent basis.\u201dMr. Egan\u2019s concerns go beyond the bottom line. \u201cAEG can do the job in terms of big shows and churning through numbers that in one sense justifies putting a lot of money into the Loew\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have the theater doing what it\u2019s supposed to do for the local community if all you look at is the cost-benefit analysis of putting people in Journal Square.\u201dThe restoration of the Kings has bolstered Mayor Fulop\u2019s plan. But the Friends\u2019 connection to the theater runs deep, and the Jersey remains the only Wonder Theater operated by a local nonreligious group whose mission is to make it as much of a community center as it was in its prime.People sometimes ask Mr. Egan if the theater is haunted. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Experts Say That Battle on Keystone Pipeline Is Over Politics, Not Facts", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2009, the Obama administration approved a 986-mile pipeline to bring 400,000 barrels of oil sands petroleum a day from western Canada to the United States. Almost no one paid attention. Construction on the pipeline, called the Alberta Clipper, was quietly completed last year. In that same period, the administration considered construction of a similar project, the Keystone XL. So far only in the blueprint stage, this pipeline has become an explosive political issue that Republicans are seizing as their first challenge to President Obama in the new Congress. The Republican-controlled House is set to pass a bill to force approval of Keystone on Friday and the Senate is expected to pass the measure in coming weeks. Republicans say the pipeline will create jobs and spur the economy while environmentalists and some Democrats say it will destroy pristine forests and create carbon pollution. Mr. Obama has vowed to veto the bill.But most energy and policy experts say the battle over Keystone overshadows the importance of the project as an environmental threat or an engine of the economy. The pipeline will have little effect, they say, on climate change, production of the Canadian oil sands, gasoline prices and the overall job market in the United States. At the same time, Mr. Obama\u2019s promised veto will not necessarily kill the pipeline because the president will retain the authority to make a final decision about its fate.\u201cThe political fight about Keystone is vastly greater than the economic, environmental or energy impact of the pipeline itself,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a big difference in energy prices, employment, or climate change either way.\u201d Environmentalists who have been arrested outside the White House protesting Keystone say that extracting petroleum from the Canadian oil sands produces more carbon emissions than conventional oil production and that the pipeline will provide a conduit to market for the oil. But a State Department review of the project last year concluded that building the pipeline would not significantly increase the rate of carbon pollution in the atmosphere because the oil is already making its way to market by existing pipelines and rail. Republicans promote the project as a major source of employment and an economic engine, but the State Department review estimated that Keystone would support only about 35 permanent jobs. Keystone would create about 42,000 temporary jobs over the two years it will take to build it \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest are in indirect support jobs, such as food service. In comparison, there were 241,000 new jobs created in December alone. Over all, the jobs represented by Keystone account than for less one-tenth of 1 percent of the American economy. \u201cThis pipeline has become a symbolic issue all out of proportion to reality,\u201d said Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy consulting firm and a former top energy official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cWhy is what ought to be a routine matter turned into an all-consuming Armageddon battle?\u201dThe story of how a routine pipeline became such a politically volatile infrastructure project began during the George W. Bush administration, when the companies that hoped to build both the Alberta Clipper and the Keystone XL submitted their permit applications to the State Department. Neither pipeline was an issue in the 2008 presidential campaign, nor did the Keystone pipeline draw much attention in the next few years as the State Department under Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reviewed the project. By the summer of 2011, top State Department officials signaled that they were on the verge of approving the pipeline.That was when environmentalists, led by an activist named Bill McKibben, made their move. Disappointed that Mr. Obama had failed to pass a climate change bill in his first term, they wanted to push him on environmental issues. They settled on the pipeline as their symbol and in that summer of 2011 staged the White House protests demanding that Mr. Obama stop Keystone. They hoped to send the message that by approving the pipeline, Mr. Obama would lose the support of his political base in the 2012 re-election. The State Department delayed the decision. In those protests, Republicans saw an opening. \u201cWhen folks started to get arrested outside the White House, it was obvious something was going on,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who frequently consults on political strategy with House Republican leaders. In their internal polls on the issue, the strategists found that Americans generally supported the project \u2014 often by a ratio of 3 to 1, Mr. McKenna said. Those numbers bear out today: A November poll by Pew Research found that 59 percent of Americans supported the project.\u201cWe saw that this thing could be a killer for us,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to grab on to. It\u2019s a simple narrative. It\u2019s easy to explain to candidates and easy for them to turn around and explain to voters.\u201dRepublican consultants advised candidates to take on the issue, and the candidates did. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, promised to approve the Keystone on his first day in office. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group with financial ties to the billionaire libertarians Charles and David Koch, criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s delay of the Keystone decision in their first ad in the 2012 campaign season. Two years later, Republican candidates for the House and Senate aired about 10,000 ads featuring the Keystone pipeline, according to data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, a political media analysis firm. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2016, frequently mentions his support of Keystone as a centerpiece of a possible job creation plan. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new majority leader, vowed that his first bill on the Senate floor would be a forced approval of Keystone. The political fight over Keystone will probably last a long time. Mr. Obama has said he will issue a final decision on the project only after a Nebraska court issues a verdict on a dispute over the pipeline\u2019s proposed route through that state. Then the State Department will complete its additional environmental review, which could push the decision back for months, if not years. Until then, Mr. McKibben and his fellow environmentalists will continue to push on the issue and hope to claim a symbolic victory if Mr. Obama vetoes the project. \u201cIt does not solve climate change if we stop Keystone,\u201d Mr. McKibben said. \u201cBut if we build out the oil sands, it\u2019s an enormous quantity of carbon that won\u2019t leave the ground. If the president blocks Keystone XL, he becomes the first world leader to say, \u2018Here\u2019s a project we\u2019re not doing because of its effect on the climate.\u2019\u00a0\u201dBut the oil will continue to flow out of Canada with or without the Keystone. \u201cThere are several oil pipelines that cross the Canadian border, and the oil is already moving to market through them,\u201d said Christine Tezak, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cIt seems strange that we\u2019re going through such gyrations over this particular piece of infrastructure, when the State Department said, \u2018Oh, sure\u2019 to the Alberta Clipper.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusEven before Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a run for the presidency in 2016, the question emerged: Could Mr. Bush win the nomination without pandering to the Republican party\u2019s conservative base in the primaries? The answer from many strategists was an uncomfortable no.Moreover, these same strategists are quick to point out that shifting to the right during the primaries is exactly what helped cost Mitt Romney the Oval Office in 2012. It seems Mr. Bush can\u2019t win the nomination without pandering and can\u2019t win the general election if he does. What\u2019s a centrist to do?For starters, don\u2019t believe these myths. Both are untrue, particularly as they relate to Mr. Romney\u2019s run in 2012.Starting in December 2011 and during every week of 2012, my co-author John Sides and I analyzed data from weekly surveys, each of which asked 1,000 people to rate themselves and the candidates on a five-point ideology scale ranging from very liberal to very conservative. Most people placed themselves in the middle, and placed Mr. Romney to the right of center and President Obama to the left.Because we have data every week, we can assess changes in average placements of the candidates over the course of the primaries and the general election. The data show that people\u2019s views about the candidates\u2019 ideologies didn\u2019t move over the course of 2012. The lines are essentially flat.For example, most people started and ended the election year believing, on average, that Mr. Romney was conservative, but not too much so. Any shifting, message-adjusting or pandering that Mr. Romney did during the primaries in 2012 did not hurt him in the general election by making him seem more conservative than he was earlier in the year, and it\u2019s not at all clear it helped him in the primaries either. Mr. Obama, on the other hand, started the election year twice as far away from voters, on average, than Mr. Romney was and got farther away over the course of the year.If anyone might have taken a hit because of ideological distance from voters in 2012, it would have been Mr. Obama, not Mr. Romney. In other words, even if Mr. Romney had moved to the right before our first survey, people did not think he was very far away from them on average \u2014 and more important, they felt Mr. Obama was a lot farther away. Yet Mr. Obama won anyway, perhaps because of the economic fundamentals: Incumbent presidents in growing economies, even slowly growing ones, are just hard to beat.The same patterns emerge looking only at independents. People who identified themselves as independents, rather than as Democrats or Republicans, rated Mr. Romney about a half-point more conservative than they rated themselves on the five-point scale, and they rated Mr. Obama nearly a point more liberal than they rated themselves, on average, in the initial wave of polling. These gaps widened at different rates over the year: The average rating of Mr. Romney grew less than one-tenth of a point more conservative among these self-described nonpartisans, but their rating of Mr. Obama moved nearly five times that much in the liberal direction. Mr. Obama\u2019s ideological gap widened over 2012 by the distance of Mr. Romney\u2019s entire gap, making the spread for Mr. Obama at the end of the campaign more than twice what it was for Mr. Romney among this group.These three pieces of evidence \u2014 that Mr. Romney was thought to be no less conservative before the primaries than during or after them, that his average rating didn\u2019t shift much at all during the entire year, and that he was ideologically closer to most voters than Mr. Obama \u2014 bust the myth that Republicans lost the 2012 election because of ideological shifts in the primaries.Mr. Romney did not lose the 2012 election because he was too conservative for general-election voters \u2014 or even for those who call themselves independents. The data could not be clearer on this point.The data are also persuasive on another point. Mr. Romney won the nomination the same way most modern-day nominees of both parties win \u2014 by shoring up the endorsements of party leaders before the first primary.\u201cWhen a fight breaks out, watch the crowd,\u201d E.E. Schattschneider wrote in \u201cThe Semi-Sovereign People\u201d in 1960. If you want to track Mr. Bush\u2019s chances of winning the nomination, watch the crowd \u2014 the elite crowd in particular.Mr. Romney won the protracted G.O.P. nomination in 2012 not by convincing voters he had moved to the right, but by convincing party leaders and other elites that he was the most viable candidate in the race. Mr. Bush can do the same.There is no evidence and no reason to believe that Mr. Bush \u2014 or Mr. Romney \u2014 is unelectable in 2016 because of the demands of the conservative wing of the party. This is not to say that the campaigns candidates run or the messages they send don\u2019t matter. They just don\u2019t matter in this way.Advertisement"}

Data released Tuesday morning showed China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy performed slightly better than expected, helping stocks to a modest rebound. By late morning, shares in Shanghai had risen 2.3 percent.But the added leverage also amplifies risk, meaning a boom can quickly turn to bust. Outstanding margin financing had more than doubled in the last six months, recently exceeding one trillion renminbi, or about $161 billion.To help keep that debt in check, the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Friday temporarily banned new margin financing at three of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest brokerage firms. After an investigation into 45 firms, the regulator said that the state-owned brokers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Citic Securities, Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan Securities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 violated rules by extending margin financing and securities lending to a large number of clients beyond the contracted term, usually six months.\n            After rising 65 percent since July 1, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.7 percent on Monday.        3,500SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX3,000JAN. 193,116.352,500\u20137.7%2,0001,5001,000JASONDJ2014\u201915The regulator \u00e2\u0080\u009cworries that some brokers have not been fully compliant in their margin finance operations, which may lead to substantial losses of their clients, and brokers themselves, in case of a market correction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Leon Qi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHence it \u00e2\u0080\u0098engineered\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a market correction.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeparately, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banking regulator moved to tighten oversight of so-called entrusted loans, a rapidly growing segment of the shadow banking industry. There are concerns that such loans have been used to invest in equities, helping to further fuel the frenzy.A spokesman for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s securities regulator denied in a statement that the moves were intended to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpush down the stock market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead, the spokesman, Deng Ge, emphasized the need \u00e2\u0080\u009cto protect investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overinterpret the stock market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The actions dovetail with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader push to manage its economic slowdown.In an effort to stimulate growth, the central bank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank of China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recently cut interest rates and loosened lending restrictions on banks. Analysts said Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall goal was to ensure that new liquidity created by the easing of monetary policy found its way into productive sectors of the economy, where it can help create jobs and does not just get plowed into the stock market.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stock market fever has made it difficult for the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank of China to further loosen monetary policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Qi, of Daiwa. The securities regulator, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis helping to cool the sentiment on stocks, with the aim that some of the incremental liquidity will go to the real economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dContaining risk is a major priority for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top securities regulator, Xiao Gang. He showed no sign of concern about the tumult as he addressed a financial forum on Monday in Hong Kong.Mr. Xiao did not specifically refer to Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market sell-off. Instead, he praised a new pilot program linking the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very important innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It cracks open the door to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still largely closed capital account, he said, in a way that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe risk can be controlled.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut he faces a delicate task in dealing with the excesses of the stock market. While he must aim to let some of the steam out, he must also avoid a runaway sell-off that could create painful losses.The rally, too, looks increasingly precarious. Trading volume in Shanghai peaked on Dec. 9, when shares worth 77 billion renminbi changed hands. The current five-day trading volume is less than a third of that level, at around 22 billion renminbi, signaling that shares could fall from their current levels.At the same time, the pace of new investors piling into the market has slowed. The number of new trading accounts opened on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges declined to 550,000 in the trading week that ended Jan. 9, down from a peak of nearly 900,000 the week that ended Dec. 12.The suspension of new margin financing accounts is likely have a significant effect on the brokerage firms, which had been ramping up such activity in recent months. Several, including Citic and Haitong, had taken advantage of their own surging share prices to announce new offerings of stock, the proceeds of which would partly have been used to invest further in margin financing. Shares in Citic Securities and Haitong Securities both fell by 16.5 percent on Monday in Hong Kong.In an announcement late Sunday, Citic Securities said it would take a number of steps to reduce risk in its existing margin finance business. Among them: raising the minimum amount of assets a client must have to secure such financing, to 500,000 renminbi from 300,000 renminbi.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe company will seriously implement the corrective measures, fully review its existing business process and systems and rules, and conduct business in strict compliance with existing business rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wang Dongming, the chairman of Citic Securities, said in the announcement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reducing Our Obscene Level of Child Poverty", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m not someone who believes that poverty can ever truly be ended \u2014 I\u2019m one of those \u201cthe poor will always be with you\u201d types \u2014 but I do believe that the ranks of the poor can and must be shrunk and that the effects of poverty can and must be ameliorated.And there is one area above all others where we should feel a moral obligation to reduce poverty as much as possible and to soften its bite: poverty among children.People may disagree about the choices parents make \u2014 including premarital sex and out-of-wedlock births. People may disagree about access to methods of family planning \u2014 including contraception and abortion. People may disagree about the size and role of government \u2014 including the role of safety-net programs.But surely we can all agree that no child, once born, should suffer through poverty. Surely we can all agree that working to end child poverty \u2014 or at least severely reduce it \u2014 is a moral obligation of a civilized society.And yet, 14.7 million children in this country are poor, and 6.5 million of them are extremely poor (living below half the poverty line).As the report points out:\u201cAmerica\u2019s poor children did not ask to be born; did not choose their parents, country, state, neighborhood, race, color, or faith. In fact if they had been born in 33 other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries they would be less likely to be poor. Among these 35 countries, America ranks 34th in relative child poverty \u2014 ahead only of Romania, whose economy is 99 percent smaller than ours.\u201dIt points out many of the corrosive cruelties of childhood poverty: worse health and educational outcomes, impaired cognitive development and the effects of \u201ctoxic stress\u201d on brain functions. It also points out the \u201cintergenerational transmission\u201d properties of poverty:\u201cIn one study, people who experienced poverty at any point during childhood were more than three times as likely to be poor at age 30 as those who were never poor as children. The longer a child was poor, the greater the risk of adult poverty.\u201dBut the report is more than just an excoriation of the hollowness of our professed American values and our ethical quandary. It also serves as an economic manifesto, making the point that allowing child poverty to remain at these unconscionable levels costs \u201cfar more than eliminating it would,\u201d calculating that an immediate 60 percent reduction in child poverty would cost $77.2 billion a year, or just 2 percent of our national budget.For context, the report puts it this way:\u201cEvery year we keep 14.7 million children in poverty costs our nation $500 billion \u2014 six times more than the $77 billion investment we propose to reduce child poverty by 60 percent.\u201dThe report cites the M.I.T. Nobel laureate economist and 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Dr. Robert Solow, who wrote in his foreword to a 1994 C.D.F. report, \u201cWasting America\u2019s Future\u201d: \u201cAs an economist I believe that good things are worth paying for; and that even if curing children\u2019s poverty were expensive, it would be hard to think of a better use in the world for money.\u201dTo pay for the effort, the report calls for some of the same things the president called for in his State of the Union speech last week, like closing tax loopholes and eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy. But it also called for a reduction in the military budget. This is an echo, in a way, of the concerns Martin Luther King had about military spending sapping money from efforts to help the poor, which he laid out in his not-nearly-cited-enough 1967 anti-Vietnam speech at the Riverside Church:\u201cI knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.\u201dWhat would we get for our $77 billion, anyway? Things like the creation of subsidized jobs, an increase in the earned income tax credit, a raise of the minimum wage, an expansion of child care subsidies and housing subsidies, and an increase in SNAP benefits.The report holds up Britain, which took some of the same steps as a case study of how such an approach can work because they \u201cmanaged to reduce child poverty by more than half over 10 years, and reductions persisted during the Great Recession.\u201dWe can do this too, if we just stop seeing helping these children as an us-versus-them struggle between makers and takers, if we stop getting so hung up on prudishness about sex and traditional views of what constitutes a family, if we stem our impulse to punish children for their mothers giving birth before marriage.By the way, Britain\u2019s out-of-wedlock birthrate is even higher than ours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Capitalists Save Capitalism?", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the White House to Congress to liberal think tanks, recent Democratic proposals would substantially alter the rules of the marketplace. These include major revisions of the tax code, legislation to pressure corporations to increase pay to match productivity growth and an expansion of refundable tax credits to include low-income workers as well as households making as much as $80,000 a year.According to a report by the former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers and Ed Balls, a top British Labor Party politician, unless there is serious government intervention, inequality and a lack of financial resources among those in the bottom half of the income distribution will result in \u201cinsufficient aggregate demand \u2013 too little spending by consumers and businesses to keep gross domestic product at its capacity.\u201d Developed nations \u201cneed new social and political institutions to make 21st century capitalism work for the many and not the few,\u201d Summers and Balls wrote.The concept of inclusive capitalism has expanded over the past 13 years to apply to those at the bottom and middle of the ladder in developed nations, including the United States. The fundamental \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d argument is that business enterprises lose profit-making opportunities when consumers have little money to spend. Inadequate purchasing power among the many threatens corporations and poses a direct danger to the top 1 percent, and, indeed, to capitalism itself.\u201cWe need to share the wealth,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and a leading proponent of the party\u2019s focus on economics.Schumer, in an interview, voiced strong enthusiasm for the Summers report. \u201cIt could bring together the left and center and even parts of the right,\u201d Schumer suggested.In his State of the Union address, Obama put it this way: \u201cLet\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.\u201dHis plan calls for the imposition of new taxes on the wealthy and on major financial institutions, totaling $320 billion over 10 years. The money would be used to finance tax cuts and credits for low-to-moderate-income men and women, and to make attendance at community colleges tuition-free.Van Hollen, in turn, would raise revenues by imposing a transaction tax on stock trades. He would use the money to finance a $1,000 tax credit for workers making less than $100,000 annually, a $20,000 deduction for two-earner families, an annual $250 payment to those who put at least $500 into an approved retirement pension plan, and to substantially increase child care tax credits.Van Hollen would also bar large corporations from deducting C.E.O. and other corporate compensation over $1 million unless employees got pay raises reflecting increases in worker productivity and the cost of living.Their report addresses four major economic developments broadly undermining wages and working conditions:First, that \u201cincreasing global economic integration has also meant increased competition for many workers who produce tradable goods and services.\u201dSecond, that \u201cadvances in robotics and artificial intelligence have put intermediate-skill jobs at risk in what economists call a hollowing out of the labor market.\u201dThird, that \u201cMajor corporations have opted to use subcontracting to perform basic functions, and many workers are now classified as independent contractors, eroding basic labor law protections.\u201dAnd fourth, \u201ccorporations have come to function much less effectively as providers of large-scale opportunity. Increasingly, their dominant focus has been on maximization of share prices and the compensation of their top employees.\u201dIn addition, Summers and Balls argue that competition in the banking sector has broken down and \u201cwill need interventions to support the reasonable functioning of the free market.\u201dWhat do these points actually signify in practice? In a section titled \u201cU.S. Policy Response,\u201d Summers and Balls call for making parent companies responsible for the working conditions of employees of subcontractors; adopting government policies favoring employee stock ownership so that workers benefit from the growing share of national income flowing to capital as opposed to wages; and imposing tough and costly sanctions on employers who use illegal tactics to fight unionization.Not stopping there, Summers and Balls call for a substantial boost in the $24,000 pay ceiling under which employees must get time and a half for overtime work beyond 40 hours a week; increased infrastructure spending of $100 billion a year, or $1 trillion over 10 years; and strengthened provisions in trade agreements guaranteeing collective bargaining rights and basic environmental protections to reduce the movement of American companies to countries with the lowest labor standards.Among their other proposed policy initiatives are creation of an income tax credit for those with moderate pay levels. It would start at $23,260 for joint filers with children, just where the current earned-income tax credit phases out. At $85,000, the credit would diminish, reaching zero at $95,000. They would also change the mortgage interest and property tax deductions into tax credits. Deductions inherently provide larger benefits to those in higher tax brackets. Credits provide equal benefits to all who qualify.In response to Obama\u2019s plan to tax the wealthy to boost breaks for the working class, Michael Steed, spokesman for the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, said in a statement, \u201cMore Washington tax hikes and spending is the same old top-down approach we\u2019ve come to expect from President Obama that hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d\u201cThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code,\u201d Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement,Josh Bivens, the research director at E.P.I., said in an email that the proposals did indeed \u201clook like a shift in the Democratic Party on economic policy.\u201d He said his hope was that \u201cthe next two years becomes a competition about who is willing to be the most aggressive in trying to boost low/middle-class incomes.\u201dWhile none of the proposals, or their advocates, acknowledge this explicitly, one of the objectives of the evolving Democratic economic agenda is to get back support among whites without college degrees \u2013 the polling shorthand version of what is sometimes still called the white working class.While the new agenda has no chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats plan to use the tenets of inclusive capitalism in the 2016 elections. One Democratic goal in putting specific policies forward is to use them as wedge issues to force Republicans to choose between their affluent backers and their supporters in the white working class. This will be no easy task because a decisive majority of whites without college degrees has been voting against Democratic candidates for two decades, making it very difficult for the party to break what has been a Republican hammerlock since 1994.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayAmericans today are taking less vacation time than at any point in nearly 40 years, according to an October report for the U.S. Travel Association by Oxford Economics. So where and how will we be spending our precious leisure time in 2015?As a new year begins, industry and research groups are looking into their crystal balls. Turns out, when Americans travel internationally most stick close to home. Michelle Grant, a travel and tourism research manager for Euromonitor International, a market research company, pointed out that nearly half of overseas travelers are from the East Coast, and they make trips within the Western Hemisphere or to Western Europe, to places that are more affordable and easier to reach (with shorter and direct flights) than those farther afield.The most popular international destination, by a landslide, will be Mexico, according to Euromonitor. Mexico topped the list last year with about 20,916,000 trips, and Euromonitor predicts it will be favored again this year, with some 21,297,000 trips, an increase of 1.8 percent. Ms. Grant noted that California and the border states are huge drivers of the trend. (The group\u2019s forecasts are derived from national statistics and trade sources and are based in part on the number of trips Americans made in 2014.)Mexico is alluring not only for its sun and sand but also for its cuisine, destination yoga retreats and cultural activities, be it exploring the ruins of ancient Maya civilization at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, a Unesco World Heritage site near Canc\u00fan, or partying in Cabo San Lucas. While some tourists are steering clear of places afflicted with gang and drug-related violence like Acapulco and Sinaloa, places like Canc\u00fan and Puerto Vallarta continue to be popular.Capturing second place is Canada. Americans made about 12,331,000 trips there last year and according to Euromonitor, it will again be the second-most visited international destination with 12,489,000 trips.For the last few years the Reputation Institute, a global management company that says it takes the pulse of more than 27,000 people in the G8 countries, has ranked Canada among the top countries in the world to visit thanks to its beauty, friendly people, safe environment and \u201ccontributions to global culture,\u201d as the Canadian Tourism Commission put it in a news release.Rounding out the top three is Britain, though it lags far behind Mexico and Canada (there were some 2,516,000 trips to Britain in 2014 and Euromonitor is forecasting about 2,546,000 this year).Britain, of course, offers a variety of lush landscapes and cultures throughout England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That said, London \u2014 with its historic buildings, parks, gardens, museums and pubs \u2014 attracted two-thirds of Americans\u2019 vacation visits to Britain, a 2013 report said, while the rest of England attracted 30 percent, according to VisitBritain, the national tourism agency. Scotland, where travelers are drawn to castles and villages, captured 10 percent of visits, while Wales had 3 percent.France, Italy, Germany, the Bahamas, Jamaica, China, Spain and Japan (the latter two essentially tied) complete the top 11, in that order. Euromonitor analysts say Japan is likely to experience the biggest bump in American tourists, thanks to decreasing prices as well as the fading effects of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis. (Forecasts for additional international and domestic destinations are at nytimes\u00ad.com/travel.)So far, the estimates appear to be corroborated by other companies. Mexico and London are among the top three international destinations being booked for 2015, according to a survey of 1,226 travel agency owners, managers and agents from the Travel Leaders Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest travel agencies. Travel professionals questioned in November and December were asked to name up to five top destinations that they were already booking for 2015. The No. 1 international trip was a cruise vacation in the Caribbean; however, in a news release, the group said that \u201cEurope is drawing in Americans in the highest numbers we\u2019ve seen this millennium.\u201dA research team at Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine, revealed a similar forecast, with London, Paris and Canc\u00fan topping its list of 2015 international destinations.But what about emerging tourist destinations? According to members of the United States Tour Operators Association, an industry group, Myanmar will be the top emerging destination in 2015. Cuba took second place in a survey for the association conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, though one suspects it will soon nab the top spot now that travel restrictions are easing because of the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States. Indeed, between Dec. 16 and 18, in the days surrounding President Obama\u2019s announcement about reopening relations with Cuba, travel queries related to the island jumped 809 percent, according to Google. Most searches came from users in Florida, New York and California. On Cuba\u2019s heels were Croatia, Iceland, India, Peru, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia and Panama, according to the survey.When it comes to domestic tourism, California has been and is likely to continue to be by far the most popular destination, according to Euromonitor. The state is projected to attract some 134,145,000 tourists in 2015, lured by wineries, food, beaches, spas, surf culture, theme parks, the slick artifice of Hollywood and the natural wonders of Yosemite and Big Sur. Little wonder California is the nation\u2019s largest tourism economy, according to Visit California, the state\u2019s marketing and tourism arm.Texas nabbed second place with an estimated 87,502,000 tourist visits in 2015, followed by Florida (69,463,000 visits) and New York (55,383,000 visits). Florida is likely to be the fastest growing state for tourism, according to Euromonitor, thanks to its sunny skies and initiatives at theme parks like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter \u2013 Diagon Alley at Universal Studios. Indeed, agents at Travel Leaders Group listed Orlando as the second-most popular domestic destination in 2015 based on bookings so far. (The No. 1 domestic vacation is an Alaskan cruise.)How Americans allocate their vacation dollars in 2015 will depend on where they decide to go. Based on national statistics and trade sources, Euromonitor analysts predict that Americans who take international vacations will spend most of their money on accommodations. Food is next on the list, followed by shopping, travel within the country and entertainment. (According to data from the United States Department of Commerce, in 2013 sightseeing and shopping were the most popular activities among leisure travelers overseas.)The rankings change a bit for domestic vacations. Analysts think Americans will spend most of their money on travel within their own country, followed by lodging, entertainment, food, shopping and excursions.Given bookings-to-date for 2015 and conversations with clients, almost 97 percent of Travel Leaders Group agents said their clients would spend the same or more on international travel this year compared with last year. Of course, the cost of any trip is determined by a variety of factors: destination, length, class of service, hotel, experiences. Taking that into consideration, analysts at American Express Travel said that based on the average seven-day trip (for international travel), a 2015 vacation is likely to cost from $2,100 to $5,000 or more. (A report from the Commerce Department shows that in 2013 the average trip expenditure per leisure traveler visiting overseas was $2,914. Most flew economy class.) Based on an average of six days for domestic travel, the trip cost could be $1,500 to $3,000 or more, according to American Express.By and large most Americans will travel by land in 2015, making 870,526,000 trips, according to Euromonitor. Air travel is likely to be a distant second (154,021,000 trips), followed by rail (78,270,000) and, lastly, sea (6,291,000).Hotels and motels will remain the dominant lodging option, but private rentals are expected to continue to garner popularity. Some 14 percent of travelers booked a private home, condo or apartment rental for at least one of their trips in 2013, up from 8 percent in 2010, according to PhoCusWright, a travel market research company.Should you make it to one of the most popular places, Britain, you may want to experience a rising trend: the so-called poshtel, a kind of elegant hostel such as Hoax or Safe\u00adstay. Hostels seem to be hotter than ever, and Euromonitor predicts that the sector will experience a record 3 percent growth through 2018.That\u2019s good news for those striving for a little luxury on a little budget in the new year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France's Sunday Pirouettes", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBefore the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks on Jan. 7, France was bracing for a dispute that, though neither violent nor volatile, nevertheless goes to the heart of the internal tensions over the role of religion in this devoutly secular country. After a tense, week-long negotiation between a special committee and the minister of the economy, Emmanuel Macron, the National Assembly will begin debate Monday on whether department stores and shops will be allowed to open more often on what has been a traditional day of rest.During his presidential campaign in 2012, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande lambasted the Right for its efforts to transform Sunday into a day like any other, devoted to business and material gain. The great battle of 2012, he declared, was over \u201cthe principle of Sunday as a day of rest, one that workers can devote to sport, to family, culture and to liberty.\u201d If elected, Mr. Hollande promised, he \u201cwould keep vigil\u201d over this sacrosanct day.After three years of political disarray, economic malaise and mounting unemployment, however, Mr. Hollande has grown increasingly desperate. In mid-December, his treasury minister, Mr. Macron, offered a battery of legislation that seeks to liberalize some of the nation\u2019s laws governing commerce and the liberal professions. One proposal in particular drew the ire of Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist party rank-and-file, not to mention the Communists: The proposed law would allow stores or businesses to open 12 Sundays a year rather than just the five now permitted.The Socialist dissident Martine Aubry published an opinion article in Le Monde that appeared the same day the government rolled out its legislation. Architect of the 35-hour week, a signature achievement of the Socialists introduced in 2000, Ms. Aubry dwelt on the meaning of the Sunday law. It is, she claimed, \u201ca moment of truth speaking to the one question that truly matters: What kind of society do we want to live in?\u201d Is this, she wondered, all the Left has left to offer: \u201cA Sunday stroll in a shopping mall and the accumulation of consumer goods?\u201dJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a fiery leftist, was even more categorical. A relentless critic of the \u201csavage capitalism\u201d he associates with America, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon declared that the Revolution had freed the French to be human, not to become captives of a \u201cblind consumerism.\u201d In the heat of battle, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon has found an unlikely ally in a traditional antagonist, the Catholic Church, which has also denounced the law. As one cleric explained, the church has joined the Communists for social as well as religious reasons. Rallying to the support of the Socialist Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who also opposes the new law, Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois reminded his flock that France\u2019s economic difficulties, though great, do not justify ignoring the benefits of \u201ca common day of rest.\u201d The French have long had conflicted feelings about Sundays. In the early 1950s, the singer Juliette Greco \u2014 one of the muses for French existentialists \u2014 made her reputation with \u201cI Hate Sundays.\u201d While she derides Sunday as dead time, made for funerals and the hollow rites of the bourgeoisie, Greco also praises Sunday as the day for making love, not things. Decidedly, as the French psychiatrist Serge Hefez notes: \u201cSundays are engraved in the French psyche.\u201d But the day is also engraved in France\u2019s history. During the last decades of the 19th century, French workers, laboring 10 hours a day, seven days a week, repeatedly went on strike to win a day of rest. In 1906, the government grudgingly conceded Sundays as a day of repose, hoping that if workers spent more time at home they would spend less time drinking in cafes. By the end of World War I, Sunday had taken root in the French cultural landscape \u2014 so much so that, in a 2008 poll, 84 percent declared that it was \u201cimportant, indeed primordial, for family, cultural and religious life that Sunday remain the day of common rest.\u201dPirouetting 180 degrees, Mr. Hollande, who had insisted Sunday was a day of republican repose, now dismisses it as a relic of an earlier age. Hammering at the same speaking points as Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Manuel Valls, President Hollande touts the liberty not to rest if one prefers to work (with greater pay, he always adds). There is no clear consensus on the proposed law\u2019s economic payoff. But one suspects that such concerns are secondary for both sides. Instead, traditionalists and modernizers are wrestling over a symbol \u2014 no small matter in a nation that, from the taking of the Bastille to the making of \u201cJe suis Charlie,\u201d understands the importance of political emblems. As if to emphasize this very point, the marathon meeting between the Assembly representatives and Macron reached the finish line ... last Sunday. This was an unprecedented event in the annals of the Fifth Republic \u2014 even the National Assembly takes Sunday off. Like politicians everywhere, France\u2019s lawmakers are attached to symbols, but they are even more attached to being re-elected. The compromise bill that will be presented on Monday punts the issue to city governments, leaving it to mayors to decide on the number of Sundays stores can open. And so, as the philosopher Andr\u00e9 Comte-Sponville presciently observed: One spends one\u2019s time \u201cworking, hurrying, waiting for the weekend. ... Finally, Sunday. For what? For nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Faces Crucial Test of 'Whatever It Takes'", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeLONDON \u2014 The European Central Bank faces a crucial test of its resolve to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro when it decides this week on buying government bonds to combat deflation and revive the economy.The adviser to the European Union\u2019s top court and the Swiss National Bank have smoothed the way for quantitative easing, or Q.E. \u2014 in effect, printing money. But fierce opposition from Germany\u2019s central bank, politicians and public may yet shackle the E.C.B.At issue is no longer whether the bank buys bonds issued by eurozone governments, which has been widely flagged, but how the program is designed and whether it is seen as credible and sufficient.The risk is that the institution that has held the single currency area together through five years of debt crisis adopts a \u201cQ.E.-lite\u201d plan that sends the wrong signal to markets, misses its target and jeopardizes the central bank\u2019s credibility.News that the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, met privately last week with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, highlights the acute political sensitivity of the decision. While Germany\u2019s central bank, the Bundesbank, is opposed to quantitative easing, which it sees as a back door to financing of feckless governments, creating potential liabilities for German taxpayers, the E.C.B. is hoping Ms. Merkel won\u2019t denounce it and will restrain her conservative allies.Some supporters of quantitative easing fear Mr. Draghi may make too many concessions to Germany by framing a program that is limited in volume and scope, doesn\u2019t share risk across borders, and excludes buying bonds of the countries with the lowest credit ratings.A draft plan circulated by E.C.B. staff this month would cap purchases at 500 billion euros, or $578 million. Some market analysts say it may need to be twice that size \u2014 or open-ended \u2014 to reach its objective.Mr. Draghi and his supporters are a majority of the E.C.B.\u2019s policy-making Governing Council, but the two German members \u2014 Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, and Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, a member of the E.C.B.\u2019s executive board \u2014 seem sure to vote against quantitative easing. A few other governors may join them. One option would be to make each national central bank in the 19-nation eurozone shoulder the risk of default on all or most of its own country\u2019s bonds that the E.C.B. purchases.\u201cThis would be at best ineffective and at worst dangerous,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, an economic think tank in Brussels. It \u201cwould be a strong signal that the E.C.B. is no longer a \u2018joint and several\u2019 institution.\u201dThe veteran Danish economist Niels Thygesen, one of the experts who designed the original blueprint for the euro in the 1980s, told Reuters: \u201cIf these are the circumstances for some Q.E., it may not be worthwhile even for strong enthusiasts.\u201d It would be a limited program designed by lawyers as much as economists.Yet by declaring E.C.B. bond-buying legal and urging courts to be cautious in challenging the central bank when they lack the expertise, an advocate general at the European Court of Justice, Pedro Cruz Villal\u00f3n, last week effectively gave a green light for full-blooded action.Although Mr. Cruz Villal\u00f3n\u2019s opinion concerned a lawsuit brought by German euro-skeptics against an earlier, unused bond-buying program, it had clear implications for quantitative easing. In particular, he argued that announcing limits on bond-buying in advance would undermine its effectiveness, that the E.C.B. should not be given seniority over private creditors in case of a debt restructuring, and that there was no bar on its buying bonds of countries with low credit ratings.This should give Mr. Draghi a free hand to buy bonds of all eurozone states proportionate to their contributions to the E.C.B.\u2019s capital for as long as needed to get inflation back toward the central bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent, from close to zero now.But the politics involved may make that impossible. Economists distinguish two main ways in which quantitative easing \u2014 used in the United States, Britain and Japan \u2014 works to revive an economy and raise prices: the \u201csignaling effect\u201d and the \u201cportfolio effect.\u201dIn layman\u2019s terms, the signaling effect describes an unambiguous message to financial markets that a resolute central bank is determined to use unlimited resources to achieve its goal. The United States Federal Reserve is the frequently cited model.\u201cJust as markets know never to fight the Fed, they need to understand that you don\u2019t bet against the E.C.B.,\u201d said a senior Eurosystem official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The portfolio effect describes the mechanism through which a central bank creates money in order to buy bonds from banks, insurers and pension funds, which reinvest it in higher-return assets like stocks and corporate bonds, often outside the eurozone. That exit of funds lowers the exchange rate, making exports cheaper and imports dearer, hence raising the inflation rate.The euro has already fallen from nearly $1.40 in May 2014 to $1.15 last Friday, its slide gathering pace as expectations mount that the E.C.B. will begin quantitative easing.Switzerland\u2019s central bank lifted a hand brake on the euro\u2019s fall last week when it abruptly abandoned a three-year-old cap on the Swiss franc\u2019s exchange rate, which had forced it to buy tens of billion euros to defend the peg of 1.20 francs to the euro.The shock move, which sparked global currency turmoil and inflicted heavy losses on some banks and brokers, showed how hard it is for central banks to tame volatile markets and how easy long-accumulated credibility can be put at risk. That carries lessons for the European Central Bank as it contemplates one of the toughest decisions in its 16-year history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Takes on Quantitative Easing, and Its Risks", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 As central banks have injected cash into their nations\u2019 economies, a question has raged over whether they have helped average people or simply made the rich even richer.Germans are grumpy that the European Central Bank chose to adopt quantitative easing over their objections. Populist parties from Helsinki to Madrid are feeding on the resentments generated by seven years of economic crisis.Official economic data due Friday is expected to underscore the region\u2019s problems. Unemployment in the eurozone will remain stuck at 11.5 percent, according to analyst estimates. Inflation is forecast to fall to minus 0.5 percent, reinforcing fears that the region is being pulled into a downward price spiral \u2014 deflation \u2014 that would discourage hiring and growth.There is little doubt that some people, countries and industries will cash in more than others. The winners include commercial banks that hold a lot of government bonds and will be able to sell them for higher prices.Another beneficiary will be exporters in Germany and elsewhere in the eurozone, whose goods have become more attractively priced around the world because of a decline in the value of the euro prompted by central bank policy. Investors have been selling euros because they can find better interest rates elsewhere.And people who own eurozone stocks are already reaping the rewards, as market indexes have soared since Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement.And then there are unpredictable chain reactions that quantitative easing could set off.But proponents of Mr. Draghi\u2019s quantitative easing argue that, whatever the potential downside, the most important thing is to do something to prevent an even more severe economic crisis that would hit poor people the hardest.For Mr. Draghi the only objective \u2014 officially, at least \u2014 is to push inflation back up toward the central bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent. Inflation that is too low \u2014 or worse, outright deflation \u2014 undercuts corporate profits, forces down wages and leads to higher unemployment.The stimulus of pumping money into the economy is supposed to automatically raise inflation, although the strategy has not worked in the United States very well because the stronger dollar has lowered the price of oil and other imported goods.The only relevant criterion \u201cis the mandate of the E.C.B. to achieve an inflation target of close to 2 percent,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.Germany, for all its criticism of quantitative easing, stands to be one of the big beneficiaries. But not all Germans will share in the bonanza.For example, the German benchmark DAX index has hit highs since Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement. Analysts at DZ Bank in Frankfurt forecast that the index would climb even higher.That is great for Germans who own shares or stock mutual funds. But only about 14 percent do. That is in stark contrast to the United States, where about half of all families own stocks directly or indirectly and have profited from the market-stoking effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing.Germany might also be benefiting disproportionately from the recent decline of the euro against the dollar. If Germany were not part of the eurozone, its currency would probably be doing what the Swiss franc is doing \u2014 rising to its highest levels since 2011, as investors look for a haven from global uncertainty. The strong franc is already creating problems for Switzerland\u2019s tourism industry, as well as its watchmakers and other exporters.But German companies are not the only ones that could enjoy a quantitative easing bonus. Italian and French exporters will benefit even more from a weak euro than German companies, Mr. Wolff of Bruegel said, because they are more likely to sell consumer goods like fashion or food products whose price tags are an important competitive factor. German companies tend to sell products like machine tools, where reliability and precision are more important than price.Commercial banks around the eurozone are other possible beneficiaries of the new Draghi policy. The central bank plans to spend 60 billion euros a month, or about $68 billion, in the bond market, which will push down yields, the market interest rates on debt. When yields fall, the value of a bond with a fixed interest rate goes up. Higher bond prices should especially help banks in Italy and some other countries that have large holdings of their own country\u2019s debt.If bankers feel better about their financial health, they may be more willing to lend to small and midsize businesses, which will in turn create jobs. Economists suspect that is exactly what the central bank is hoping for.\u201cA big part of this is just cleaning the bank balance sheets after the sovereign debt crisis,\u201d said Viral V. Acharya, professor of finance at Stern School of Business at New York University.But Mr. Acharya said central bank bond buying was an inefficient way to fix eurozone banks. At the rate that the European Central Bank plans to buy bonds, he said, it will take months for banks to unload their holdings.\u201cBanks are the ones that will have to transmit this policy,\u201d Mr. Acharya said. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic this will happen very fast.\u201dOverly indebted homeowners in Spain and Ireland have reason to raise a toast to quantitative easing, to the extent banks do become more willing to lend. They should be able to refinance their homes at even lower interest rates and make smaller monthly payments.But that benefit will be smaller in Germany, where most people rent their homes and debt levels are low. And besides being renters, Germans are also savers who will earn even more dismal interest rates.As for the most vulnerable people in the eurozone \u2014 the unemployed and the working poor \u2014 there is no certainty that any benefits from monetary stimulus will reach them.The big hope seems to be that the program will improve the mood among businesses, which will be inspired to hire.\u201cIt could have some good implications in terms of the business mind-set,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International.But because the rewards of euro-style quantitative easing are so uncertain, some economists propose a more radical solution to ensure that all citizens get their share.That idea does not sit well with central bankers, though. \u201cIt would be very complicated to do that,\u201d Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, told the broadcaster Europe 1 on Monday.\u201cIf there are things to be done that target citizens directly, it is up to governments to do it,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said. \u201cThat is not our work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Other E-Commerce Giant Follows Its Own Path", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is in part a publicity stunt for Mr. Liu, the 41-year-old billionaire who is the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive. But it is also a way to better understand the technical and logistical challenges facing JD, which is in a pitched battle for e-commerce supremacy in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the United States.While Alibaba\u2019s marketplace serves as a platform to connect buyers and sellers, JD buys goods from manufacturers and distributors and holds the inventory in its own warehouses, in a model that echoes Amazon\u2019s. It then arranges for quick delivery of virtually everything from television sets and refrigerators to socks and T-shirts, using motorbikes that weave in and out of traffic in some of the country\u2019s biggest cities.Like Amazon, JD has invested heavily in infrastructure, pumping more than $1.5 billion into building and leasing warehouses and order-fulfillment centers around China. But JD has gone even further, venturing into home delivery with its own fleet of trucks and more than 20,000 couriers, all in the hope of capturing what is projected to be a $1 trillion Chinese e-commerce market by 2020.JD, which is publicly traded in the United States, is now China\u2019s biggest direct-sales retailer, with 46 million active users and an estimated $20 billion in revenue last year.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a business model for everyone, but they were smart to build it,\u201d said Elinor Leung, a Hong Kong-based Internet analyst at CLSA, an investment bank. \u201cNow, their traffic is exploding.\u201dAnd yet this costly approach to building an online retailer has worried some analysts, who say that JD could be weighed down by physical assets and debt. Several analysts say the company won\u2019t turn a profit before 2017. Competitors like Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba, have even disparaged the company\u2019s business model, calling it tragically flawed.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we are better,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a recently published interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of direction. So, I tell my people: Definitely do not get involved with JD.com. Don\u2019t come blaming us if you die one day.\u201d He later apologized for his comments.Executives at JD, which is based in Beijing, insist they are building a company that will eventually have a commanding advantage in e-commerce, with strong customer service, speedy delivery and assurances that the products it ships are authentic, not counterfeit. Among the biggest challenges now, they say, is keeping up with an enormous volume of online orders, which have doubled in each of the last three years.\u201cIf we wanted, we could be profitable right now,\u201d said Shen Haoyu, chief executive of JD Mall, the company\u2019s biggest division. \u201cBut our immediate goal is to grow our customer base.\u201dJD is a product of its founder\u2019s ambitions. The son of a cargo shipowner, Mr. Liu grew up in one of the poorest parts of east China\u2019s Jiangsu Province, before arriving in Beijing to study sociology at Renmin University.During his spare time in college, he wrote software code and earned enough money to buy a small restaurant near campus. He says the restaurant failed after staff members embezzled large sums of money.After college, Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, worked briefly for a Japanese company before going into business for himself. He rented space at an electronics market in the city\u2019s high-tech zone, called Zhongguancun, to sell software and electronics, including compact disc burners. Within a few years, he owned brick-and-mortar electronics shops in three cities.In 2004, when his stores began selling goods on the web, online shopping was just beginning to take shape in China, led by start-ups like Dangdang, Joyo and Alibaba\u2019s Taobao site. JD, whose English name at the time was 360Buy.com, thrived on low prices and fast delivery, part of its motto today.With money running low in 2006, Mr. Liu sought $2 million from a Hong Kong venture capital firm. The firm, Capital Today, put up $10 million instead, for a large minority stake. The stake is now worth close to $2.4 billion, even after the firm sold some of its shares.The capital injection helped JD expand its product offering beyond electronics and develop new systems and software. The expansion, in turn, helped lure bigger investors, such as Tiger Global, the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and the Waltons, the family behind Walmart Stores.\u201cThe first time I met him, I knew he was smart and trustworthy, and that he had a killer instinct,\u201d said Kathy Xu, the partner who led the Capital Today investment.Investors bought into Mr. Liu\u2019s vision for a full-service online retailer.At the time, China\u2019s package delivery services were terrible. The country had new roads and bridges, but truck shipments were hampered by poor service, toll roads and other bottlenecks. With no Chinese equivalent of FedEx or UPS, packages often arrived late, in dented boxes.\u201cBack then, 70 percent of our complaints were about deliveries, and everything was very slow,\u201d Mr. Liu said during an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cWe realized logistics is related to user experience.\u201dSo beginning in 2007, JD did something no other Chinese e-commerce company was willing to do then or since. It started building an integrated logistics network from scratch, promising to cater to customers from click to drop-off.Today, the company boasts seven fulfillment centers and 118 warehouses in 39 cities. There are also 1,045 smaller pickup centers in about 500 cities. And since 2010, the company has pledged that most online orders placed before 11 at night will be delivered by 3 p.m. the next day.Morgan Stanley calls JD\u2019s business model a combination of Amazon and UPS; other analysts say the company is beginning to look like Walmart, steeped in logistics and infrastructure and backed by a website.JD \u201chas made it clear they will not only be a retailer but also an online supply chain and finance company,\u201d said Lu Jianping, who teaches e-commerce at East China Normal University in Shanghai. \u201cRetail is not profitable but it offers trading volume and cash flow. In the future, the main profits will come from finance and the supply chain.\u201dBy following its own path, JD has sought to make online shopping easier for China\u2019s growing consumer class, promising authentic goods, delivered on time, for little or no delivery fee \u2014 and with a receipt, something hard to come by in a country where tax evasion is rampant.Today, traffic to its website is exploding and the company is filling more than two million orders a day. No other direct sales retailer in the world has seen its revenue grow as quickly as JD, not even Amazon.Around the same time, he also struck a deal with China\u2019s social media and mobile gaming giant Tencent, which allows JD to tap into Tencent\u2019s huge user base. Tencent now owns about 20 percent of JD.Mr. Liu is also pushing JD into online groceries and finance, and lending to his vendors the way Alibaba does. But unlike Alibaba and Amazon, he says he has little interest in developing film or entertainment divisions.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to produce films or TV shows, but finance, yes,\u201d Mr. Liu said, before returning to his thoughts on infrastructure. \u201cAnd every few years we\u2019ll invest in new warehouses. We need some temperature-controlled warehouses.\u201dPhoebe Peng contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Windfall for Taxpayers Coming to an End", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying campaign continues to produce one clear benefit: a windfall for taxpayers.The Fed, which turns over most of its profits to the Treasury Department, said on Friday that last year, it transferred an estimated $98.7 billion, a record. The Fed\u2019s profits have been large enough to significantly restrain the growth of the federal debt, cutting aggregate deficits by about 8 percent since 2010.But the good times are drawing to a close. The Fed\u2019s earnings will decrease as it raises its benchmark interest rate, a process that Fed officials say they are likely to begin later this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that the Fed\u2019s annual transfers could reach a low point of just $8 billion in 2018.The Fed did not buy the bonds to make money. It has amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to stimulate economic growth by holding down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Fed says the campaign has helped people buy cars and refinance mortgages. Some independent experts, however, see scant evidence of an economic lift.The purchases are undoubtedly lucrative, in large part because the Fed pays for the bonds with money that it creates, rather like a restaurant with the unusual power to create hamburgers from nothing. As a result, the interest payments on those bonds are very nearly pure profit, which the central bank is required by law to remit to the Treasury Department after subtracting its operating expenses.The Fed has sent Treasury $421 billion over the last five years.The Fed\u2019s portfolio consists of government debt \u2014 Treasury securities and mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 so the Fed is effectively refunding interest payments, reducing federal borrowing costs.Over the next several years, the Fed\u2019s expenses are likely to rise.Last year, the Fed spent about $4.9 billion on its own operations and provided $563 million in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which assumed some of the Fed\u2019s regulatory responsibilities after the financial crisis.The Fed also paid banks about $6.9 billion in interest on deposits they keep with the central bank. And as the Fed retreats from its stimulus campaign by raising its benchmark interest rates, it plans to sharply increase those payments.Banks must maintain reserve accounts with the Fed in proportion to their outstanding loans and other assets, but they earn interest on any excess. Those excess reserves have ballooned as the Fed has bought bonds from the banks because the Fed\u2019s payments have significantly outpaced lending growth.As it begins to raise its benchmark interest rate, the Fed plans to increase those payments as a check on lending growth. When a bank makes a loan, some of its excess reserves become mandatory reserves, reducing revenue. So banks will make loans only if the likely return exceeds the lost income from the Fed.In effect, the Fed plans to build a dam between the money that it has created to buy bonds and the rest of the money that circulates through the economy.Fed officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the dam will hold, but the strategy is untested \u2014 Congress only granted the Fed authority to pay interest on excess reserves in 2008 \u2014 and some critics see a danger of flooding. They warn that the Fed may fail to check loan growth, leading to runaway inflation.\u201cAs the economy grows, the massive amount of money sitting on the sidelines will be activated; the velocity of money will accelerate,\u201d Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a speech last year. \u201cIf it does so too quickly, we might create inflation or financial market instability or both.\u201dComparing the Fed\u2019s challenge to the proverbial difficulty of passing a camel through the eye of a needle, Mr. Fisher said, \u201cThe eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat.\u201dPaying banks billions of dollars not to make loans also may expose the Fed to sharp political criticism, particularly because foreign banks hold a large share of the excess reserves and thus stand to receive much of the payments. Foreign banks like Deutsche Bank, UBS and the Bank of China held about 43 percent of excess reserves at the end of 2013, according to a report last year by the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank for central banks.The Fed has said the decline in profits could be large enough in the coming years that it might not be able to transfer any money for the first time since 1934.Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, contended in a paper last year that the Fed should retain some of its current earnings as a reserve against the possibility of losses. Fed officials have adopted a cosmetic version of that strategy, emphasizing in public remarks that lower profits or even losses should be seen in the context of the present windfall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, on 3-State Tour, Is Expected to Offer State of the Union \u2018Spoilers\u2019", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama went to Detroit on Wednesday to kick off a three-day, three-state presidential trip that is intended to steal the political spotlight from the newly empowered Republicans on Capitol Hill during their first week in control of Congress.Speaking at a Ford automobile manufacturing plant that is building both gasoline-powered hybrid vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, Mr. Obama claimed credit for the nation\u2019s economic improvement during his first six years in office, in part by highlighting the robust recovery of the auto industry that he agreed to bail out in 2009.\u201cPlants like this one built more than cars. They built the middle class in this country, and that was worth fighting for,\u201d Mr. Obama told a crowd of autoworkers. \u201cSaving the American auto industry was the right thing to do. Betting on you was the right thing to do.\u201dThe president has frequently returned to Detroit to brag about the success of his early \u2014 and controversial \u2014 use of taxpayer money to rescue two of the three American car companies. But on Wednesday, Mr. Obama went further, saying that, like the auto industry, the American economy is booming again.\u201cAs a country, we have every right to be proud of what we have got to show for that hard work,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you otherwise.\u201dThe speech in Michigan is the first he will give this week. On Thursday, the president will talk in Phoenix about efforts to bolster the still struggling housing market. And on Friday, he will visit Knoxville, Tenn., to discuss the need to make college affordable for everyone.The president\u2019s advisers are calling the visits \u201cSOTU Spoilers,\u201d using the acronym for the president\u2019s annual State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. The prime-time speech traditionally includes an array of policy proposals and announcements that are kept secret until the final hours before the president delivers it, to build public interest in an otherwise predictable event.But in the prelude to this year\u2019s speech, set for Jan. 20, Mr. Obama is traveling the country and dribbling out some proposals in advance.In Detroit, Mr. Obama cited a series of statistics that he said was evidence of the American comeback: the creation of 11 million private-sector jobs, the enrollment of 10 million people in health care plans, and a surge in American manufacturing.\u201cWe\u2019re making more stuff, we\u2019re selling it around the world,\u201d he said.For years, the White House has been wary of declaring an economic victory even as many families continued to struggle financially. But aides said the president\u2019s speech in Detroit would emphasize the nation\u2019s consistent job growth, arguing that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies have set the stage for a more impressive recovery.\u201cWe have seen the American economy build up some more momentum, particularly in the second half of last year,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cThe result has been not just that we staved off a second Great Depression but we\u2019ve actually laid the groundwork for a stronger recovery that\u2019s actually the envy of the entire world.\u201dThere were concerns that if the industry collapsed \u201cright at a time when we\u2019re teetering on the brink of a Depression \u2014 that we might not be able to control the fallout,\u201d Mr. Obama said, according to the newspaper.\u201cThe question was not, \u2018Do we intervene?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe question was, \u2018How do we intervene in a way that actually spurs the sort of restructuring that gives American automakers the chance to get back in the game?\u2019 \u201dAides said the president would offer several new proposals on Thursday and Friday to extend the administration\u2019s policies regarding housing and college affordability.\u201cSome of his announcements will be executive actions, and others will be legislative proposals,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer wrote of the \u201cspoilers\u201d in Wednesday morning\u2019s op-ed.Officials said the president would challenge Republicans to pass bills that he could sign. But aides said Mr. Obama would use the speeches in Phoenix and Knoxville, Tenn., to continue his recent practice of using the executive powers of the presidency to advance his agenda.Officials declined to offer specifics, but one White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Obama would not make his proposals public until later this week, said he expected the president\u2019s announcements of executive actions on housing and college affordability to \u201cgenerate debate\u201d in Congress and elsewhere.Republicans have attacked the president for using executive authority and regulatory interpretations to shield immigrants from deportation and to impose new climate rules on power plants. Critics say the president is abusing the power of his office.On housing, Mr. Earnest said there had been \u201cimportant gains\u201d in the housing market in the second half of last year, \u201cand the president wants to build on those gains and see if there is more that we can do to try to help responsible middle-class homeowners who, again, are trying to do the right thing.\u201dIn Knoxville, Mr. Earnest said, the president, speaking at a community college, will \u201ctalk about a range of ideas that he has for making sure that we have the kind of work force that we need in this country to continue to remain the strongest, most vibrant economy in the world.\u201dMr. Earnest declined to say specifically what proposals Mr. Obama will make in the two cities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Days of Sirens, Fear and Blood: \u2018France Is Turned Upside Down\u2019 ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 It was a day of sirens, helicopters in the air, frantic news bulletins; of police cordons and anxious crowds; of young children led away from schools to safety. It was a day, like the previous two, of blood and horror in and around Paris, one that ended with France unsure whether this drama is now truly over or a predictor of more cultural, religious and political violence to come.France has been profoundly shaken by the killings of famous cartoonists and editors on Wednesday in an act of violent religious extremism, followed by an extensive manhunt that could have been staged by Hollywood, and then the bloody denouement on Friday: Muslim extremists killed, hostages dead in a kosher market busy on the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and others badly wounded. If this was France\u2019s 9/11, as some said, the shock was that much greater for having come not at the hands of foreigners, but French citizens fluent in the language of Voltaire and Pascal.\u201cWe are all worried,\u201d said Arnaud Delaytermoz, 32, a law student from Bordeaux who was in the subway near the market when he heard large explosions and came out to see what had happened. \u201cIt was going to happen one moment or another, in Paris, Bordeaux, anywhere.\u201dThe images could hardly have been more jarring, especially in a city with Paris\u2019s history. When it became clear that the assailant at the kosher shop had chosen it to target Jews, Rue des Rosiers, a street known for its Jewish shops and restaurants \u2014 and for the deportation of its citizens during World War II \u2014 was shut down by the police.Near the airport, in an industrial park north of Paris, where two brothers sought in the killings at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo were holed up with a hostage, it was a paramilitary scene. It concluded when the men, who the authorities said wanted to die as martyrs, charged out firing at the police. At the kosher market, which the police raided almost simultaneously, hostages fled the store while others lay dead near the gunman.Even with the immediate crisis having passed, it was a miserable day for a nation already buffeted by a stagnant economy, high unemployment, a weak president and a growing far-right movement that can easily exploit this latest display of homegrown Islamist extremism. There is a larger mood of defeatism in France, and anxiety about the strength of the French model and the structure of the government known as the Fifth Republic, made for a strong president but run for years now by men considered too small for the task.A visual timeline of the attack and the events that followed.So as France grieves, it is also faced with profound questions about its future: How large is the radicalized part of the country\u2019s Muslim population, the largest in Europe? How deep is the rift between France\u2019s values of secularism, of individual, sexual and religious freedom, of freedom of the press and the freedom to shock, and a growing Muslim conservatism that rejects many of these values in the name of religion?And crucially, too, there are serious questions about the performance of the intelligence services and the government. In coming days, the government will be forced to confront whether more intelligence or better security might have thwarted the plot against Charlie Hebdo.\u201cFrance is turned upside down,\u201d said Luc Matti, an editor.\u201cPeople are traumatized. There is a sort of unity between the republican left and the republican right,\u201d he said, noting that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has called for a unity rally this weekend.Yet Mr. Hollande, already deeply unpopular, is considered a weak president, and \u201cin several weeks it will be like before,\u201d Mr. Matti said.\u201cThe trend is bleak \u2014 there\u2019s a real risk of civil war,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that if the Western world becomes majority Islamophobe, if there develops a fear and hatred of Islam, then our world and that of our children is heading in a bad direction.\u201dFriday was a Paris different from the tourist boulevards and the \u201ccity of light,\u201d a plunge into the world of the banlieues, the heavily immigrant suburbs that exist outside the ring road that acts like a moat for richer, whiter central Paris.The Parisians who gathered near the hostage drama at the kosher grocery, kept behind police lines at Saint Mand\u00e9 in sight of the Eiffel Tower, were both captivated and concerned. Gloria Guttierrez, 39, lives nearby and works at a neighborhood synagogue. \u201cWe\u2019re very shocked,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause this is France, which means liberty and fraternity, and today we don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a dangerous country,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe anymore.\u201dThe Muslim challenge felt real to her. \u201cI hope things will change,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t cling to religion too much, because that leads to war.\u201dMr. Delaytermoz, the student from Bordeaux, said he was troubled by the sense of religious and cultural conflict, saying that he was shocked and \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by the Charlie Hebdo attacks. France\u2019s strong foreign and military policy, in particular its interventions in Mali and alongside the United States in Iraq, \u201cprobably influenced the crazy people who perpetrated these attacks,\u201d he said.He hoped that the dire situation of France \u2014 these attacks, political divisions, the rise of the far-right National Front, the stagnant economy with high unemployment \u2014 would jolt the government. But he also praised its response to Wednesday\u2019s killings. \u201cThey warned people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made sure people had the right information.\u201dMr. Delaytermoz said that whatever France\u2019s current problems, on display this difficult day, he intended to remain hopeful for the future. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t be defeatist,\u201d he said.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What a Rise in Obama\u2019s Approval Rating Means for 2016", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusAfter a difficult year, President Obama is enjoying a modest rebound ahead of State of the Union address Tuesday. His approval rating has increased to around 46 percent over the last month, according to an average of polls taken over the last month, up from 42 percent in the weeks after the decisive Republican victory in the midterm elections.It is a relatively small increase, but it is more impressive in the context of the unusual stability of Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating, which hovered between 42 and 44 percent for 15 consecutive months. In 2016, the president\u2019s approval ratings should be a telling indicator of whether the country is likely to support another Democratic administration.There is a well-established relationship between the pace of economic growth and a president\u2019s approval ratings, and Mr. Obama is clearly benefiting from signs of accelerating economic growth. For the first time since the start of the recession, more Americans believe the economic conditions are good or excellent than poor. Consumer confidence rose to an 11-year high last week, according to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index.Only a handful of modern elections have not had an incumbent president on the ballot. In these contests, the president\u2019s approval ratings are unsurprisingly less important than when a president is running for re-election. So Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings will matter in 2016, but it is hard to say exactly how much.The balance of evidence suggests that the break-even point for the presidential party\u2019s odds of victory is at or nearly 50 percent approval. If the only thing you knew about the 2016 election was Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating on Election Day, you might guess that the Democrats had a 37 percent chance of holding the White House with a 46 percent rating \u2014 rather than a 23 percent chance with a 41 percent rating. The difference between 41 and 46 might be worth between one and two percentage points to the Democratic candidate in 2016 \u2014 the difference between a close race and a modest but clear Republican victory.Mr. Obama\u2019s surge among Hispanic voters might be particularly telling. It is a sign that Democratic-leaning voters dissatisfied with Mr. Obama\u2019s performance might not be so disillusioned that they can\u2019t be lured back to the Democrats by the issues and messages that brought them to the party in the first place. The president\u2019s ratings among liberals and Democrats remain mediocre \u2014 perhaps only in the low 70s and low 80s, respectively \u2014 suggesting that there are additional, low-hanging opportunities for Mr. Obama and his party\u2019s next nominee.Of course, there\u2019s a long time between now and 2016. Mr. Obama\u2019s ratings could continue to climb with sustained economic growth; they might relapse with another round of bad news. But the modest improvement in Mr. Obama\u2019s standing suggests that the Republicans cannot count on an easy midterm-like victory if the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Is Sending You a Present", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRick Perry!Wow, the Republican race is getting to be like one of those crime shows where the detectives have to paste pictures all over the wall so they can keep the suspects straight. So many old friends popping up this month \u2014 Mitt Romney and now Rick Perry. The man who drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the car roof and the man who claims he shot a coyote while jogging. The animal lobby had better get out there and see how Jeb Bush feels about wolf hunting.Almost everybody has a Rick Perry favorite moment. For 99 percent, it\u2019s probably the dreaded \u201coops\u201d debate when he announced that as president he was going to shutter three federal agencies \u2014 and then could only think of two.And, yeah, that one was pretty good. However, I still cherish a television interview Perry did a few years earlier with Evan Smith of The Texas Tribune in which he defended abstinence-only sex education despite the state\u2019s astronomical rates of teenage pregnancy.\u201cIt works,\u201d Perry said defiantly and totally erroneously.\u201cCan you give me a statistic suggesting it works?\u201d asked Smith.\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you from my own personal life. Abstinence works,\u201d Perry replied. Smith was too discreet to press for details, but let\u2019s hope it comes up during the campaign.Perry had been governor of Texas for more than 14 years, an all-time record. In his farewell speech to the State Legislature, he reminded the lawmakers of all they\u2019d been through together, including hurricanes, wildfires and the tragic disintegration of the Space Shuttle Columbia over Texas in 2003, although Perry called it \u201cSpace Shuttle Challenger,\u201d which blew up in 1986.No mention of his pending felony indictment for abuse of power. Perry tried to force a county district attorney to resign by threatening to veto the money for an office she runs that investigates public corruption. It\u2019s a complicated story. First you learn that the D.A. in question had been arrested in a rather spectacular drunken-driving case, and you tilt a little toward Perry. Then you discover that two other county D.A.\u2019s were charged with drunken driving during the Perry administration without attracting the wrath of the governor. Then you sort of get distracted by wondering what\u2019s going on with Texas district attorneys.We\u2019ve got ages to work it out.Perry bragged about the state\u2019s economy, which he often refers to as \u201cthe Texas Miracle.\u201d Really, we have not heard so much about miracles since Our Lady of Fatima. The state\u2019s record of job creation is his big calling card to the presidential league, and once he starts harping on it again we\u2019re going to wonder: Has Texas been growing so many jobs because Perry cut taxes and regulations? Or is it because Texas happens to be a state with warm weather, lots of space for cheap housing, a huge border with Mexico and massive oil and gas deposits? Is Perry a great leader or just conveniently located? Eventually, someone will repeat the old joke about being born on third base and thinking you hit a triple.Perry\u2019s signature job-building initiative is something called the Texas Enterprise Fund, which aims to persuade out-of-state companies to move to Texas, or expand there. One of its beneficiaries, Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine, got $50 million in return for creating what Perry said were more than 12,000 jobs. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed the fund folk had been counting every single biotech job created anywhere in the state for the previous six years. Actually the number was more like 10.But it\u2019s great that the governor\u2019s ambitions are forcing us to think a lot about Texas, a state that deserves more attention, having been home to only three of the last eight elected chief executives. Not even half! And although lawmakers from Texas currently lead six of the committees in the House of Representatives, that\u2019s still under a third.There\u2019s also United States Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, making all the pre-presidential-campaign stops and offering an option to all of us who are yearning for a vision to the right of Rick Perry. I once threw out the possibility of an entire Republican ticket from the Lone Star State, and many readers desperately wrote to argue that that was unconstitutional. It might be fairer to say that the Constitution isn\u2019t crazy about the idea.We can figure that out down the line. Meanwhile, Perry and Cruz could both be in the presidential debates. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s better at counting to three.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Running for Daylight (Obama, Not Brady)", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 THE talk up in Boston is all about deflation while the talk down here is all about inflation.Our sleek, techie president, whose battery dies faster than an iPhone\u2019s, was fully charged Tuesday night for the State of the Union.He was so puffed up, with such a bristling sense of self, that it was hard to believe this was the same guy who spent the last year clenched like a fist, beset by ISIS, beheadings and Ebola, shunned by his own party and slammed by the other party in the fall election.The murmur went up from grateful Democrats gathered at the Capitol: \u201cWow, he\u2019s got a pulse.\u201d Proving once again that he is a different kind of cat, Barack Obama is oddly pumped by his party\u2019s defeat. Even in the House chamber, surrounded by hundreds of people and watched by millions, he seemed to delight in his detachment as he laid down his own markers to drive up his own numbers. He doesn\u2019t mind splendid isolation. He really thinks it\u2019s splendid. He\u2019s free to revert to being the consummate outsider who doesn\u2019t see himself in the context of a system.He likes the game better when he\u2019s up against an opposing team. To him, Harry Reid was as big a problem as Mitch McConnell.Now it\u2019s easier for him to see who he is and where he stands vis-\u00e0-vis the Republicans because he doesn\u2019t have to make intellectual compromises or negotiate the jagged shoals of the old-school Democratic Party. Now he can define himself against modern conservatives such as Rand Paul and Scott Walker.President Obama feels he will be able to finally float above it all, more singular and more interesting and more separate, debating enlightened progressive topics like criminal justice reform and child care infrastructure while those off-kilter conservatives fight it out for 2016. Unlike F.D.R., Obama was not determined to give Americans heart and courage at times of crisis. Instead, his White House tended to take on the coloration of his funks and the clouds spread worldwide. He only began to really brag on the economy Tuesday night, when he felt certain of the numbers, rather than before the midterms, when it might have helped his party. He could have done a better job all along explaining where we stood and where we were hopefully headed. As one top White House official says about the Obama inner circle, \u201cThey\u2019d rather be right than win.\u201d He\u2019s alone on the stage \u2014 always his preferred setting. As an isolato, he can say what he thinks and define himself on his own terms. He can ascend to the mountaintop and ignore us when we pester him to come down.\u201cBarry got his groove back,\u201d as Larry Wilmore, the droll host of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Nightly Show,\u201d put it.We got the guy we\u2019ve been yearning for only when he was able to blow us all off. He can finally do and say whatever he wants.One Democrat who saw Obama in the White House said the president was so buoyant he had an air of \u201csenioritis.\u201dIt seemed a shame, the Democrat said, that Obama couldn\u2019t have a third term, now that he was, at long last, fired up and ready to go. Of course, if there was a third term, he would be waiting another four years to show the mojo.Thrilled to sidestep the press, he felt liberated enough, even as Yemen spiraled, to go on YouTube and make his case to the appealing GloZell Green, a YouTube star wearing glowing green lipstick who got famous eating cereal out of a bathtub. Remarkably, The One has ended up in the same place the unpopular W. found himself at the end of his two terms: casting his lot with history.Now that it\u2019s all about him, he doesn\u2019t get languid and reflective. He rolls up his sleeves and crisscrosses the country.Anyone expecting Clintonesque triangulation or even a conciliatory nod to the winning team Tuesday night was disappointed. Instead, they got the State of the Veto Threat Address. The president goaded Republicans, who chortled when he reminded them he was done running for office. He shot back with his favorite snarky rejoinder to Republicans: I won.Obama won the presidency by creating a magnetic narrative. But then, oddly, he lost the thread of his story and began drifting. He didn\u2019t get to the point Bill Clinton did, where he had to insist he was relevant, though last summer, some of his frustrated hopey-change-y acolytes talked about having an intervention with the rudderless president. But others argued against it, pointing out that, while Obama might not have the presidency that was giddily anticipated, during the 2009 tulip-craze phase, he was doing what he wanted.He wanted to do what he saw as right and have the public and the pols come along simply because he said it was right.But when the Potomac didn\u2019t part when he was elected, he got grumpy and decided not to play the game.When the public was jittery about ISIS, Ebola and Ferguson, Obama responded like a law professor. He made a stunning speech on race to save his 2008 campaign, but he has stayed largely detached from the roiling race drama that stretched from St. Louis to New York.In Year 7, when everyone else has started focusing on 2016, he suddenly popped up with a full-throated narrative and rationale for his presidency: It is time for the middle class to share the wealth and the Republicans are still protecting the rich.The State of the Union was not so much \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d as \u201ctoo much, too late.\u201dRepublicans said Obama was in \u201cFantasyland.\u201d While free community college educations, money for child care, new roads, new taxes on the rich, initiatives on climate change and partying in Cuba are all feel-good ideas for Democrats, a lot of that isn\u2019t going to happen and he knows it.Though President Obama\u2019s numbers are up, the results are likely to be pretty meager. When he trolled Republicans in his speech, it felt good to him and Democrats jumped for joy. But Republicans will have their revenge \u2014 and not just Netanyahu\u2019s visit.In the end, the speech told us less about the state of the union than the state of Obama. The state of Obama is strong, if solitary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Risk of Fragmenting, Yemen Poses Dangers to U.S.", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNow, days of factional gun battles in the Yemeni capital have left the president a puppet figure confined to his residence. The country appears to be at risk of fragmenting in ways that could provide greater opportunities both for Iran and for Al Qaeda, whose Yemeni branch claimed responsibility for the first Paris terrorist attack this month.The Houthis\u2019 rise to a dominant position may set off local conflicts in ways that would give more breathing room to Al Qaeda\u2019s local branch, which has repeatedly struck at the United States. Yemen\u2019s elected president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is a stalwart American ally but has almost no domestic support.\u201cThe Yemeni state has always been weak, but now there\u2019s a real danger of economic meltdown, and of the kind of fragmentation that could ultimately make Yemen almost ungovernable,\u201d said April Alley, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that works to resolve conflicts.The Houthi takeover \u2014 which began in September and was reinforced in recent days \u2014 has deepened sectarian and regional divisions in a desperately poor country that has long been a sanctuary for jihadists. And though the latest round of fighting appeared to end Wednesday when Mr. Hadi conceded to the Houthis\u2019 political demands, the underlying crisis will continue to fester, analysts say.The deal announced Wednesday addressed a number of the Houthis\u2019 grievances, including a lack of representation in government bodies and complaints about provisions in a draft constitution. In return, the Houthis agreed to withdraw fighters from the presidential palace and other parts of Sana and to release an aide to Mr. Hadi who was kidnapped by Houthi gunmen on Saturday. But there was little doubt that the Houthis, who have repeatedly threatened in recent months to use force to win political concessions, remain in control.The Houthis\u2019 public humiliation of Mr. Hadi \u2014 a southerner \u2014 prompted southern rebels to close the country\u2019s chief port in Aden and shut the border between the north and south earlier this week, raising the specter of actual secession. Armed tribesmen have cut off oil exports in three southern provinces. And Saudi Arabia, which sees the Houthis as a proxy of its regional rival, Iran, has shut off almost all aid to the Yemeni government, leaving it virtually penniless and unable to pay salaries.The Saudis, who have long been Yemen\u2019s economic lifeline, pumping in more than $4 billion since 2012, say they would rather allow the Houthis to take the blame for the approaching economic collapse than provide aid to an Iranian client, according to a Yemeni official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing diplomatic protocol. Other Persian Gulf countries are likely to follow the Saudi lead.In another ominous sign, the Houthis appear to be gearing up for a major battle with their Sunni Islamist rivals in Marib Province, to the east of the capital, where much of Yemen\u2019s oil infrastructure is. That could prove devastating to Yemen\u2019s government and economy, which is deeply dependent on oil.It could also exacerbate sectarian tensions in a country that was almost entirely free of them until recently. The Houthis belong to the Zaydi branch of Shiite Islam, and Saudi Arabia \u2014 whose leaders see all Shiites as heretics \u2014 has been providing aid to Sunni tribes in Marib, diplomats say, fueling another proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Some of the tribes refer to the Houthis as an occupying force, undermining their claim to represent a broad-based national movement.In Washington, military and intelligence officials expressed grave concerns on Wednesday about the violence in Sana and the impact any further deterioration could have on one of the Obama administration\u2019s staunchest counterterrorism partners. Michael G. Vickers, the Pentagon\u2019s top intelligence policy official, said analysts were still trying to determine the Houthis\u2019 ultimate goal.The meteoric rise of the Houthis has drawn global attention to an insurgent group that was almost unknown outside Yemen a decade ago, and whose agenda is still opaque to many people both inside and outside the country. Their leader, a charismatic guerrilla fighter in his early 30s named Abdel Malik al-Houthi, inherited his mantle from his father and his older brother Hussein, who founded the movement in the 1990s and was killed in the first of a series of wars against the Yemeni state that ended in 2010. Mr. Houthi\u2019s speeches focus on fighting corruption and fulfilling the agreements reached in a series of \u201cnational dialogue\u201d sessions that ended last year. Those demands have helped bolster public support for the Houthis \u2014 which remains strong \u2014 in a country where corruption has gutted the state and appears to have worsened since Mr. Hadi became president after the uprising of 2011.But the Houthis are often seen through the lens of their identity as revivalist Zaydis, a group that was dominant in Yemen\u2019s government for centuries and was then marginalized in recent decades. They modeled themselves in important ways on Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia, and though their ideology and leadership are distinct and unmistakably Yemeni, they are allied with Iran, which has provided them with weapons, training, and money, especially since 2011.The Houthis\u2019 continuing and bloody battle with Al Qaeda has led some in the West to see them as potential partners, despite the trademark Houthi slogan, \u201cGod is great; death to America; death to Israel.\u201dUnder Yemen\u2019s former president, Mr. Saleh, \u201cthe formula was to milk the U.S.A. for support in the fight against Al Qaeda, which was a recipe for more drones and more radicalization,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton who has written extensively on Yemen. \u201cThe Houthis actually want to fight Al Qaeda, which could be more effective.\u201dBut the Houthis are also allied with Mr. Saleh, who remains a powerful figure in Yemen and is bent on revenge on those who engineered his ouster during the turmoil of 2011. If the Houthis succeed in consolidating power, many in Yemen expect a bloody power struggle between them and Mr. Saleh\u2019s loyalists in the military and the tribes.The Houthis long benefited from a reputation for honesty and discipline, much like their mentor group, Hezbollah. But the arrogant behavior of the Houthi gunmen who descended on Sana in September, bullying government ministers and their ideological opponents, has spent some of that good will. The conflict between the Houthis and their mostly Sunni rivals has led some Yemenis to give up on the state.In Taiz, Yemen\u2019s third-largest city, the local governor has taken over the military and intelligence quarters and is effectively governing a city-state. In southern Yemen, which was a separate country from 1970 until 1990 and fought a brief civil war against the north in 1994, many have similarly seized on the Houthi ascendancy as an opportunity to break away. Those aspirations have fueled fears of a wider breakdown that could benefit Al Qaeda, which ejected government officials across a wide stretch of the south in mid-2011 and declared an Islamic emirate that lasted about a year.Shuaib al Mosawa reported from Sana, Yemen, and Kareem Fahim from Baghdad.

{"Headline": "European Central Bank Hints of Stimulus as Euro Falls Against Dollar", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A strong indication on Friday that the European Central Bank is on the verge of aggressive action to stimulate the economy, just as the Federal Reserve is dialing back its stimulus, helped push the euro to its lowest level against the dollar since 2010.Investors interpreted Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments to mean that the central bank is moving closer to broad-based purchases of government bonds, the same kind of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d that the Fed used to push down market interest rates in the United States \u2014 and is phasing out as growth picks up.The diverging paths of the two central banks prompted investors to put money into dollars, on the expectation that interest rates in the United States will rise and offer a better return than in Europe, where interest rates are falling.The euro fell to 1.20 against the dollar on Friday, its lowest since June 2010, while the yield, or market interest rate, on German two-year government bonds fell to a new low of minus 0.11 percent. The yield has been below zero since September; investors were willing to effectively pay the German government to keep their money safe.The larger picture is not merely that the dollar is gaining against the euro. Signs that the Fed is getting closer to raising its benchmark interest rate from zero have helped the United States currency to soar against its counterparts in Japan, Britain and in major emerging markets. Against a broad basket of currencies, the dollar has risen more than 13 percent since September to its highest level in almost six years.Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments were part of an ever-louder drumroll from top European Central Bank officials signaling that quantitative easing could come as soon as the next monetary policy meeting, on Jan. 22.\u201cThere are growing indications that the E.C.B. will decide as early as January to buy government bonds on a large scale,\u201d Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.In his comments to Handelsblatt, Mr. Draghi sounded more concerned than he has in the past that low inflation is becoming entrenched in the eurozone, with potentially grave consequences for the growth.Mr. Draghi said there was a risk that low inflation could cause people to delay making purchases. If so, that would be a classic symptom of deflation, a broad-based decline in prices that eventually undercuts company profits and leads firms to cut workers.The risk of deflation \u201ccannot be ruled out completely, but it is limited,\u201d Mr. Draghi told Handelsblatt. But he added, \u201cIf inflation remains low for a long time, people might expect prices to fall even further and postpone their spending.\u201d\u201cWe are not there yet,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cBut we need to tackle this risk.\u201dThe euro on Friday reached its lowest level against the dollar since June 7, 2010, when it hit $1.1923. The currency of the 19-nation eurozone has fallen nearly 14 percent since it climbed to $1.3910 on May 7.The last time the euro was so low, Greece\u2019s debt problems were causing havoc in the eurozone and there was fear the common currency would not survive. Greece is again in turmoil, with coming elections likely to usher in a left-wing government, but is no longer the main cause of the euro\u2019s decline.The concern now is that the eurozone is already stuck in the same kind of stagnation that has afflicted Japan for two decades.\u201cHistory shows that falling prices can be as damaging to the prosperity and stability of our countries as high inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi told Handelsblatt.The weaker euro is a mixed blessing for the struggling eurozone economy. European exporters will gain a competitive advantage against foreign rivals because their products will become cheaper for customers who pay in dollars or other currencies that tend to track with the dollar.A weaker euro could also push up inflation \u2014 a desirable outcome at the moment \u2014 because foreign goods would become more expensive in euro terms.With the collapse of the crude oil market adding to the downward pressure, economists expect an official report next Wednesday to show that consumer prices fell at an annual rate of about 0.1 percent in December, down from the rate of 0.3 percent in November.However, a weaker euro also has negative effects in the eurozone. Because oil is usually priced in dollars, a weak euro cancels out some of the economic benefit from the recent drop in oil prices.Cheaper energy is good for companies because it reduces production costs for factories. Consumers benefit because they pay less for fuel and can spend the money on other things.Mr. Draghi reiterated that the E.C.B. does not try to achieve a certain exchange rate for the euro. The recent decline in the euro, he said, is \u201ca natural outcome of diverging monetary policy path in the U.S. and the euro area. Markets expect a less accommodative monetary policy in the United States. This contributes to a stronger dollar.\u201dMr. Draghi and other top E.C.B. officials appear to be preparing financial markets for stronger action to combat low inflation.And if the central bank were to hold its fire now, Mr. Pisani-Ferry warned, the consequences for the financial system would be disruptive, as investors have already factored in quantitative easing. Disappointing those expectations would bring \u201can abrupt and damaging unwinding of positions: Long-term interest rates would rise, stock markets would sink, and the exchange rate would appreciate,\u201d he wrote.Peter Praet, a member of the central bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview published on Wednesday in B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung, a German financial newspaper, that oil\u2019s slump \u201ccould mean negative inflation during a substantial part of 2015.\u201d\u201cThere is the risk that we won\u2019t have achieved the degree of monetary accommodation that we had intended,\u201d Mr. Praet said. \u201cThis is why we have to be very vigilant and ask ourselves: Have we done enough?\u201dAmong the 25 members of the central bank\u2019s Governing Council, which sets monetary policy, a majority appears to be in favor of beginning quantitative easing immediately. But the council might wait until March, when it holds its second monetary policy meeting of the year, to persuade reluctant members from Germany and some other countries.In addition, the central bank may need more time to prepare for what would be a large, complex and unprecedented intervention in bond markets.By speaking to German newspapers, Mr. Draghi and Mr. Praet may have been trying to weaken resistance in the German public to central bank bond buying. Many Germans fear that they will be stuck with the bill if some eurozone countries like Greece or Italy are unable to pay their debts.\u201cPublic opinion in Germany is very important for us,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which the euro fell to a low against the dollar. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}

Many of the other trends he listed were undeniable: unemployment and the deficit down, health insurance and educational attainment up. But his statement about wages left more room for debate.The White House, for its part, could point out that inflation was falling over the same period, which meant that real wages \u2014 the ones that matter \u2014 have actually risen. Real wage growth over the past year, at 1 percent, is near its highest level since the financial crisis ended.The larger truth about wages is that we don\u2019t yet know what they\u2019re doing. But I think the question is one of the most important for the American economy, and for American politics, this year. It will help determine the national mood, the relative strength of Mr. Obama and the Republican Congress, and the atmosphere for the 2016 presidential campaign.The numbers on wages and incomes don\u2019t usually receive nearly as much attention as the data on jobs, stocks or even interest rates.

But regardless of income level, the report found, most Americans lack the recommended level of savings.Even if they tapped all available resources, including assets that can be costly to tap, like retirement accounts and investments, the typical middle-income family can replace just four months of income, the report found.The position of lower-income households is particularly precarious, the report found, with less than two weeks\u2019 income available in their savings and checking accounts and cash on hand. Such families generally have less access to credit than higher earners, so have fewer options during a financial crisis.The report drew from a variety of economic data sources, including surveys from the United States Census Bureau and the University of Michigan.Slower income growth in the last decade may have contributed to inadequate savings levels, researchers said. But some trends described in the report, they said, aren\u2019t new. For instance, the report found substantial fluctuation in family income is the norm; in any given two-year period, nearly half of households experience a change in income of more than 25 percent \u2014 whether up or down. Such volatility, which has been fairly constant since 1979, \u201clikely contributes to families\u2019 inability to build a financial cushion,\u201d said Erin Currier, director of Pew\u2019s financial security and mobility project, in a call discussing the findings with reporters.The report and additional research that is underway are aimed at achieving a broader understanding of household finances that will help policy makers create programs that promote \u201casset accumulation.\u201dPersonal financial experts say there are ways to build savings, even with limited income. \u201cThe hardest part is the psychological side,\u201d said Daniel Boylan, an instructor of finance at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. \u201cThe idea of saving six months of income sounds impossible.\u201dMr. Boylan advises setting an initial goal of one month\u2019s pay, then moving on to two months\u2019 after the first goal is attained, then three months\u2019, and so on. \u201cTake it one step at a time,\u201d he said.J. Michael Collins, director of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advises automating savings by having a fixed amount \u2014 even if it\u2019s a very small amount \u2014 regularly transferred from your checking account to a savings account. \u201cIf it\u2019s up to you to decide every month if you want to do it and how much,\u201d he said, \u201cit won\u2019t happen.\u201dJonathan Morduch, a professor of public policy and economics at New York University who has studied the financial habits of low- and moderate-income families, said even lower-income families saved, but they tended to put aside money for specific items they knew they would need in the next two to three months \u2014 say, back-to-school clothes or holiday gifts \u2014 rather than building reserves for an emergency that may or may not happen.For some people, getting started is the biggest hurdle. Christina Mele, 50, who works for a temp agency in Virginia Beach, Va., said she had never had a savings account until she started saving for an emergency fund last year, after enrolling in the Bank On education program sponsored by the City of Virginia Beach, local banks and community groups.She set up a savings account at a credit union and has 5 percent of her paycheck automatically deposited to the account. She declined an A.T.M. card so that she couldn\u2019t easily get to the money. She has saved $600 toward her goal of $1,000. \u201cIf you have to physically walk into a branch to withdraw the money,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll think twice.\u201dHere are some questions about building emergency savings:An emergency savings account should be accessible \u2014 since the point is to be able to get the money quickly if you need it \u2014 but not too accessible. Using a bank separate from where you have a checking account helps. Enlisting a trusted friend or family member as a \u201cmoney guard\u201d can help you stay on track.Mr. Morduch said one young man he encountered in his research was trying to save for a deposit to get his own apartment, so he gave his cash to his mother to keep in her account, even though he had his own savings account.Email: yourmoneyadviser.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christie\u2019s National Aspirations Underlie State Speech ", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeaking in the ornate Assembly chamber full of local and state dignitaries, Mr. Christie seemed largely to be addressing, or pre-empting, criticisms \u2014 from Democrats, but also from fellow Republicans in a field of White House aspirants that becomes more crowded by the week.\u201cIt has become fashionable in some quarters to run down our state,\u201d the governor said dismissively. He did not explicitly mention the problems that have already shaped his detractors\u2019 critique: the eight credit downgrades on his watch, more than any other New Jersey governor; an unemployment rate that remains higher than the national average; the regain of only about half of the jobs lost in the recession even as the nation has recovered all those jobs and more.Instead, Mr. Christie urged his audience to consider \u201cwhere we were and how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d noting that when he took office, unemployment was much higher, and that his Democratic predecessor had also struggled to balance the budget.\u201cThe state of our state continues to get better,\u201d Mr. Christie said in an optimistic opening, but one that was well shy of the triumphal declaration of robust health that governors and presidents often deliver in these annual checkups. While Mr. Christie, 52, took the podium here as governor, he spoke as an all-but-declared presidential candidate. He pronounced the nation \u201cbeset by anxiety\u201d and called for \u201ca New Jersey renewal and an American renewal.\u201d\u201cAmerica\u2019s leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cDuring this time of uncertainty, it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain.\u201dMr. Christie spent the biggest chunk of his speech on the need to streamline drug treatment and prisoner re-entry programs, an issue that resonates with liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike.He boasted of progress in Camden, where a new police force, a new schools superintendent and new businesses lured by state subsidies have produced optimism in what the governor repeatedly noted was once considered \u201cthe most dangerous city in America.\u201dNor did Mr. Christie mention Atlantic City, where one-third of the casinos closed in 2014, the fourth year in what had been a five-year plan by the governor to turn that struggling city around.Mr. Christie has been governor five years and has the scars to show for it. As he used his speech to pitch himself to a national audience, he had to explain some of those blemishes.So he argued that state employee pensions are underfunded \u201cbecause of poor decisions by governors and legislatures of both parties, over decades, not just years.\u201d He did not add that he failed to make the pension payments he himself had promised.And he emphatically declared \u2014 saying it twice \u2014 that his administration had contributed more money toward the state\u2019s outstanding pension obligations than any other. (His critics note that his Democratic predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, contributed more, on a percentage basis.)The governor said: \u201cWe need to address this anxiety head on. We need to renew the spirit and the hopes of our state, our country and our people.\u201dThe governor once planned to run for president based on his ability to attract broad support in blue-state New Jersey, but the poll showed him losing support he once enjoyed among independents, women and public employee union households.By a wide margin, New Jersey voters said he was more concerned with running for president than running the state.On this last criticism, Mr. Christie seems unfazed. He met with reporters from national media outlets before the speech, causing a minor uproar among reporters for New Jersey outlets, who were shut out. He will spend Wednesday in South Carolina, delegating his powers, as he has for most of the past month, to his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno.Advertisement"}

Waving to George and Amal in their speedboat on Lake Como. Coming home at night to cocktails on the terrace of my cutting-edge London apartment.And I can actually slip into at least some of them for a couple of weeks, at the small cost of lending my own home.Over the last three years, my husband and I have traded our Manhattan brownstone for a light-filled canal house on the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam; an apartment just steps from La Concha in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain; a rather generic ski condo in Utah; and, this past summer, an apartment in the Sodermalm neighborhood of Stockholm and a houseboat in Copenhagen\u2019s equivalent of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.We\u2019ve saved money. Every night we spend in someone else\u2019s home is a night of not paying for a hotel room, and that can add up to thousands of dollars over the course of a vacation. But more important has been the chance to experience a place like a local, learning which bakery has the great bread and which one is better for pain au chocolat, keeping an afternoon appointment with the gelato stand one block over, navigating by local landmarks (turn right at the Cut the Crap hair salon) to get back to \u201cour house.\u201dHome swapping is a first cousin to using sharing economy disrupters like Uber and Airbnb, though in a straight-up exchange no money is changing hands. It remains a tiny part of the traveling world, according to Douglas Quinby, vice president for research at PhoCusWright, a travel research firm, in part because of the structural obstacles to swapping homes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a home that\u2019s available where you want to go, you\u2019ve got to match and marry dates, you\u2019ve got to match for an equitable home,\u201d he said. And \u201cyou have to be somewhere that other people want to go.\u201dPeople always ask, don\u2019t you feel odd having strangers in your house? And the truth is, no. The exchange relationship is at once intimate and distant. You sleep in each other\u2019s beds, use each other\u2019s towels, borrow the lingonberry jam and, maybe, that fancy conditioner in the shower, but you don\u2019t often meet. I frequently find myself scouring our hosts\u2019 houses for clues as to who they are, reading the titles on the bookshelves, staring at the photos on the walls and pondering their design choices. It didn\u2019t surprise me to learn that our Dutch host was a product designer with a piece in MoMA\u2019s gift shop, based on the spare, white beauty of her living room. The two little girls in our Swedish hosts\u2019 photographs must be teenagers by now, judging by the copies of \u201cInsurgent\u201d and \u201cDivergent\u201d on their shelves. And surely it meant something that at both of our exchanges this past summer, volumes of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s creative-class best-seller, \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d were on the shelves \u2014 my husband was racing through it, too.So far we haven\u2019t traveled to cities with long lists of tourist requirements dutifully to be checked off. Our experiences trend less toward forced march and more toward leisurely stroll.It was mid-August and everywhere we turned, someone was sitting in a slice of sun, soaking it up. We got into the habit of joining them. From afternoon into the lingering evening, the sidewalk cafes and outdoor beer halls were filled. I couldn\u2019t help but notice, though, that every place was stocked with fleece blankets, an omen perhaps of the cold, dark days to come.After a week in Stockholm we moved on to Copenhagen. Working out our back-to-back exchanges had taken an algebraic equation of home swapping, in which the Danish family stayed in our house in New York in February, while we were in the Utah ski condo, which belongs to a man who currently lives in Qatar. The Swedish family took over our place while we stayed in theirs (then they stayed the second week while we moved on to Denmark). The Danish family had another house they could stay in while we were on the boat. We still owe the owner of the Utah place a week at our house.Advertisement"}

Mr. Cuomo described his plan, to let seven regions north and west of New York City vie for one of three $500 million revitalization grants, as a form of tough love for suffering communities.\u201cIf I just gave you the money, you wouldn\u2019t do all the hard things you have to do to actually get the money,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said. \u201cAnd the competition amongst yourselves, I\u2019m telling you, brings up the performance of everybody.\u201dThe Rochester event was the second day of policy proposals from Mr. Cuomo, as he previews elements of the second-term agenda he will showcase on Wednesday, when he is to deliver his State of the State address as well as his spending plan for the coming year.Mr. Cuomo this week announced a property tax proposal promising some $1.7 billion in aid for homeowners and renters through a \u201ccircuit breaker,\u201d a legal mechanism that would give a tax credit to some New York residents whose total property tax bill exceeds 6 percent of their income.Like the grant competition, the circuit breaker will need legislative approval. However, Republicans who control the State Senate are likely to seek broader cuts in property taxes.Another pending issue is the possibility of changes to the criminal justice system, given the national debate following the killings of unarmed men in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island by police officers who were not indicted.Mr. Cuomo said this week that he was considering changes to grand jury rules, including whether their deliberations should remain secret after the fact. \u201cThe situation is unsustainable in New York City,\u201d he told reporters on Long Island on Wednesday, adding, \u201cYou need a justice system that people trust.\u201dThe competition for $1.5 billion, if enacted, would begin in April, with grants awarded in the fall to the three winning regions. It builds on two initiatives the governor began during his first term: regional economic development councils, which give money for projects in 10 regions of the state, and his effort to direct $1 billion in aid to Buffalo.Praising the governor\u2019s approach, Mr. Zemsky said that \u201cAlbany played no constructive role\u201d in previous attempts to jump-start the upstate economy. \u201cAll that has changed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Decline in Problem Mortgages", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesWhile the lingering effects of the housing-market collapse continued to recede last year, millions of homeowners will still struggle in 2015 and beyond.Nationally, foreclosures and serious delinquencies have dropped significantly from a year ago. And the share of underwater homeowners (who owe more than their homes are worth) is down almost by half since the 2012 peak. But even as the national outlook is looking closer to normal, many major markets have a much longer way to go. However, in markets where home values are still substantially off their bubble-era peaks \u2014 including Las Vegas, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit and Phoenix \u2014 negative equity will continue to be a major factor through the end of this decade, said Stan Humphries, the chief economist for Zillow. Appreciating values in these markets reached such unsustainable heights that people who bought around the peak are destined to be underwater longer, he said. Zillow\u2019s research shows that in Phoenix, home values are still 28 percent off the peak, and that nearly 22 percent of homeowners there are still underwater. Mr. Humphries noted that, for most people, negative equity is a nonissue unless they are forced to sell their homes for some reason. And at that point, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll have to negotiate with their bank and figure out how to short sale their house. If they need to get out more quickly, it will likely go into foreclosure.\u201dNationally, the foreclosure inventory made up 1.6 percent of all homes with a mortgage, but some states are dealing with higher levels. The highest foreclosure inventories as a percentage of all mortgaged homes were in New Jersey (5.5 percent), Florida (4.1 percent), and New York (4.1 percent). All three states handle foreclosures through their judicial systems, which prolongs the process. The national delinquency rate has fallen steadily since peaking in 2010 at nearly 7 percent. TransUnion predicts the rate will continue to fall in 2015, but projects the highest delinquency rates by year\u2019s end in New Jersey (5.46 percent), Florida (5.27) and New York (4.43).\u201cThat\u2019s a function of the economies in those states and how long it\u2019s taking foreclosures to work their way through the system,\u201d said Steve Chaouki, the head of financial services for TransUnion. Many of the delinquencies are older loans that are still on the books, whereas loans originated over the last few years \u201care performing well within the historic norms\u201d for delinquencies, he said.The historic norm is 1.5 to 2 percent. TransUnion projects that 33 states will reach or come within 0.5 percent of that range by the end of 2015. Nebraska is projected to have the lowest delinquency rate, at 0.95 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inflation in Britain Falls to Lowest Rate in 15 Years", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Driven by drastically falling oil prices and lower food prices, British inflation fell to 0.5 percent in December, a steeper drop than was expected and the lowest rate recorded in the past 15 years.While far below the government\u2019s inflation target of 2 percent, the annual rate was welcomed by many economists as a result of lower oil prices, and not a broad drop in demand for goods and services in critical areas of the economy.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the rate was good news for British households in the short term, as rising wages and falling prices mean every pound stretches further.\u201cThe issue is to make sure that this doesn\u2019t become more generalized and that we don\u2019t see low and falling prices more generally,\u201d he added in an interview with the BBC.But in Britain, unemployment has fallen to 6 percent, and services inflation of 2.3 percent looks robust. About 77 percent of the British economy is driven by services. Wage growth is starting, at long last, to rise. And while the United Kingdom in 2009 began its campaign to stimulate the economy through large-scale asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, the European Central Bank is just gearing up for it.\u201cThere\u2019s a bigger risk that deflation will be ingrained in the eurozone because of the labor market,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, senior economist for Britain at Capital Economics in London. \u201cUnemployment is higher, and downward pressure on wage growth is significant.\u201dMr. Tombs said he was not worried about deflation in Britain. Even if the figure dipped into negative territory, he believes it would be good for the British economy, reflecting lower commodity prices but not underlying weakness.The fall means that Mr. Carney by law must write a letter to George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, explaining why the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target was so undershot. The inflation rate in December fell from 1 percent in November.The drop in consumer prices in December was driven by sharply lower gas prices, flat utility bills and stable food costs amid a price war among supermarkets, economists said. The fall in the price of crude oil \u2014 the international benchmark dropped below $46 a barrel on Tuesday, plummeting about 8 percent in two days \u2014 means that inflation could fall even further.Some economists predicted that inflation could fall into negative territory.The British pound fell after the data was published, to $1.5083 against the dollar.Hailing the benefits of low inflation for consumers, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr. Osborne, whose Conservative Party is seeking to hold onto power in the May election, seized the political moment on Twitter.Whether voters will give them credit for that is unclear as oil prices and the supermarket wars \u2014 the factors driving inflation lower \u2014 have nothing to do with domestic policy.Other economists also welcomed the news. \u201cWith inflation likely to fall further and earnings growth now finally trending upwards, consumers should see appreciable improvement in their purchasing power in 2015,\u201d Howard Archer, chief economist for Britain and Europe at IHS Global Insight, said in a note.For much of the past several years, the growth rate in paychecks in Britain had not kept up with increases in consumer prices. But now, salaries are outstripping inflation. Annual weekly earnings were up 1.8 percent in October, Mr. Archer noted, putting them more than a percentage point higher than consumer price inflation.The drop in the inflation rate will also heighten expectations that the Bank of England will not raise interest rates any time soon.Mr. Carney told the BBC that he still expected interest rates to rise, though perhaps in a more muted fashion. \u201cRelative to a year ago,'\u2019 he said, \u201cit\u2019s probably a little more gradual and a little more limited than it was then, largely because of factors outside our shores.'\u2019Britain was showing healthy economic gains in 2014, raising expectations for a rate increase early this year. But concerns emerged late last year that the British economic recovery might be losing steam on the back of weakness in the eurozone and a slowing housing market.In December, the Office for National Statistics lowered its estimate for growth over the last 12 months to 2.6 percent, from 3 percent. It said the economy grew by 0.7 percent from July to September, down from 0.8 percent in the second quarter.\u201cThe worry here is that our economy is too driven by consumption and not balanced enough,\u201d said Liz Martins, an economist for Britain at HSBC.She predicted that Britain\u2019s gross domestic product would grow 2.4 percent in 2015, down from her previous estimate of 2.6 percent.An earlier version of this article omitted part of the name of an economics organization where Howard Archer serves as chief economist for Britain and Europe. It is IHS Global Insight, not IHS Insight.Advertisement"}

Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d Mr. Obama knows his prospects of getting Congress to agree are less than zero; Republicans dismissed his ideas before he even voiced them. That does not make them irrelevant. Mr. Obama was speaking not just to the present but to the future, to the 2016 presidential elections and even beyond. By simply raising the plight of the middle class (and, looming behind it, the larger issue of economic inequality), he has firmly inserted issues of economic fairness into the political debate. Hillary Rodham Clinton or whomever the Democrats nominate cannot ignore them now. Even Republicans, disinclined to raise taxes on top-tier earners, may find attractive the idea of doing something for those in the middle.Further, while the rhetoric was combative, even defiant in parts, the president\u2019s proposal is hardly radical. It would raise the capital gains tax to 28 percent \u2014 which is where it was in the Reagan era. It would impose ordinary income tax rates on dividends and end a provision in the tax code that shields hundreds of billions of dollars in appreciated wealth passed on to heirs. These changes, plus a new fee on big banks, would finance a set of tax breaks for middle-income families, including credits for two-earner couples, increased child care and college tuition credits, as well as other programs, including two years of tuition-free community college for some students. And the whole thing is designed to be revenue-neutral, the tax increases paying for the new programs to avoid the endless wrangling over deficits that have exhausted both political parties as well as the American public. It was hardly surprising that a president who expects so little from Congress devoted some of his speech to celebrating the things that he has accomplished against considerable odds. With Congress\u2019s help, he rescued the automobile companies, jump-started the renewable energy industry, imposed new rules on financial institutions and, most dramatically, engineered a major overhaul of the health care system. On his own initiative, he ordered major reforms in immigration policy, forged a landmark agreement with the automobile companies on fuel efficiency and proposed tough restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. His task will be to defend these initiatives from almost certain congressional attack, wielding his veto pen, or threatening to wield it, much as President Bill Clinton found himself doing after Newt Gingrich and his Republican majority took over the House in 1995. President Obama should also seek out opportunities to use his executive authority to improve conditions for the middle class and for workers, such as fixing overtime rules, and, at every opportunity, use the bully pulpit on important matters like improving the minimum wage. There is one other thing he must do: Resist his instinct to follow the false promise of compromise. Give-and-take is part of the legislative process, but trade-offs amounting to Republican legislative triumphs are unacceptable. Gridlock seems almost foreordained over the next two years. Mr. Obama should do nothing to confuse the voters as to where the responsibility lies. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Bad Economic Ideas", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S economic proposals in Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address were a disappointment. His ideas \u2014 free community college, an enhanced tax credit for child care and higher taxes on high-income earners and large financial institutions \u2014 failed to go beyond mere talking points. With no chance of engaging the Republicans, they will surely die without a hearing.But the president\u2019s proposals do invite a case for a comprehensive tax and entitlement reform, one based not on redistribution but on growth, work and opportunity.Our unwillingness to confront mounting inefficiencies in the nation\u2019s tax code and growing obligations in entitlement programs has led to increasingly limited options.\u00a0Corporate tax reform is held hostage to the misguided idea that tax cuts and tax increases must be balanced within the corporate sector alone, and to the faulty assumption that beneficial tax reform will not raise economic activity.Piling up child tax credits and subsidies for health care over narrow household income ranges, as the president proposes, leads to high rates of taxation on earnings from work as assistance is phased out.\u00a0Likewise, raising marginal tax rates on investment by the well-to-do reduces asset prices and is a threat to continued economic expansion.The first is to move to a simple business tax system, with a lower marginal tax rate and no special industry preferences. There would be no separate corporate tax, only a single business income tax for all businesses. Ideally, investment would be expensed, and its cost deducted in the year it was made, rather than deducted gradually. Businesses would be able to bring back overseas profits free of additional United States taxes. A one-time modest tax on current overseas earning could be used to help finance reform. Such a business income tax would encourage both growth and investment opportunities in the United States, while offering more jobs and higher wages to American workers.The second step is to use the individual income tax to better reward work. The top tax rate for most Americans would be the same as the business income tax rate. To maintain progressivity, a surtax on wages would be collected on very high earners. To make work more attractive, low-income workers, including single workers, would receive an expanded earned-income tax credit and a tax credit to buy health insurance (as opposed to the more complex subsidies that exist under the Affordable Care Act). The earned-income tax credit would be phased out gradually.Workers would have the choice of switching to options available under current law for employer-provided health insurance and a health savings account, or a tax deduction for their own health insurance and health savings account as incomes rise. Reductions in marginal tax rates to support work would be paid for by limits on tax deductions for more affluent households.The third step focuses on education and training. Like investment in technology and machines, investment in human capital should be deductible from income. Out-of-pocket educational expenses for bona fide\u00a0schooling and vocational training could be tax deductible for all but affluent households. Personal re-employment accounts could be made available to all individuals facing more than temporary unemployment, with individual financial support for training and a bonus for re-employment.The fourth step is to strengthen retirement security, while acknowledging the need for fiscal consolidation in entitlement spending. Minimum benefits for Social Security and Medicare could be strengthened to ensure that people with low lifetime incomes avoid poverty in old age. To reduce future deficits in these programs and to free up funds to support work and opportunity for younger workers in the future, Social Security benefit growth would be slowed for more affluent individuals.In the same spirit, changing Medicare so that individuals would purchase insurance from one of a number of competing plans, with the federal government paying part of the cost, could focus the largest subsidies for health insurance on those with low lifetime incomes. Converting Medicaid to a block grant \u2014 in which federal support would be turned over to states \u2014 would give governors the flexibility to support health insurance tax credits for low-income residents, community health centers or other experiments in health insurance and delivery at the state level.These four steps offer a road map for growth, work and opportunity without sacrificing income security. Other policies, including free trade, open competition and immigration reform, are also important. But these four steps can take place in a budget discussion, and congressional leaders and the White House have both emphasized the need for a more timely budget resolution. While the reforms I sketched are comprehensive, they can be implemented in discrete steps \u2014 no \u201cgrand bargain\u201d is required. And realistic proposals to advance growth, work and opportunity, not ideological talking points, are what we need right now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2014 Auto Sales Jump in U.S., Even With Recalls", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the history of the contemporary auto industry is written, 2014 will go down as a year of contrasts. Deluged by safety recalls, auto manufacturers faced the ire of regulators and consumers. Yet, buyers did not stay away and instead gave the American auto industry its best sales year in nearly a decade.The result, announced on Monday, was a crushing sales success: Nearly one million more vehicles were sold in the United States last year than in 2013. According to the tracking company Autodata, 16.5 million new autos hit the streets \u2014 the highest number since the record of 16.94 million in the prerecession days of 2006.Analysts cited a host of reasons for the growth: a rebounding economy, increasing consumer confidence, falling gas prices and cheap leases all helped unleash pent-up demand that sent Americans into dealers\u2019 showrooms last year.Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said that \u201c2014 blew away anyone\u2019s expectations.\u201dWith low gas prices and an improving economy putting more money in people\u2019s pockets, Americans were ready to spend on new vehicles. \u201cUtility vehicle and luxury segment really benefited, as consumers were willing to spend more,\u201d Mr. Anand said. \u201cAmerica loves its S.U.V.s and trucks.\u201dBut 2014 was good for the largest vehicles, too. General Motors benefited from the public\u2019s return to its embrace of full-size S.U.V.s. The Chevy Tahoe rose 18 percent, while the GMC Yukon surged 48 percent for the year.Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for AutoTrader.com, said G.M. ended the year \u201con a very high note, particularly in light of a year of really bad recall news.\u201dIn the end, the company\u2019s sales were down slightly for the year, and the Ford brand posted a yearly drop of 1.1 percent on volume of 2.39 million vehicles, down nearly 26,000 from 2013. Its car sales fell 4 percent for the year; only two models, the Mustang and Fusion, posted gains.More vehicles, including old models, have been recalled in the United States in 2014 than ever before. Explore the size and scope of the recalls, and find out if your car has been affected.Ford\u2019s truck sales declined about 1 percent. That dip was largely because of Ford\u2019s gamble that a striking redesign of its F-150 \u2014 long the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the United States \u2014 would be worth it. The company sold about 10,000 fewer F-Series pickups in 2014, as its Dearborn plant shut down for weeks to retool for the mostly aluminum-bodied new truck, and some buyers sat on the fence.Ford is making a big bet on the F-150, which is only now starting to reach buyers. Ms. Krebs, the analyst, said that Ford could call 2014 a transition year, but she added, \u201cThe real test comes this year, when the new F-150 is on the market in full force.\u201dToyota and Nissan also reported strong sales in the United States. Toyota rose 6 percent for 2014, and Nissan increased 11 percent. Honda\u2019s sales rose about 1 percent for the year.Already, the industry is looking ahead to what 2015 could bring, and whether last year\u2019s robust sales will continue.Christopher Hopson, director of light vehicle forecasting at IHS Automotive, said he anticipated the final push of 2014 could reflect the momentum expected for 2015, and is forecasting the industry could sell 16.9 million vehicles this year \u2014 on par with the high of 16.94 million sold in 2006.Others urged caution. Ms. Krebs said the equation for 2015 would be different for automakers in one important way: More used cars are finally expected to come onto the market. That would put more pressure on new-car dealers to find ways to persuade buyers to choose a new vehicle instead of a good used one, she said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of supply,\u201d she added, \u201cand the automakers will have to deal with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homeowners in Poland Borrowed in Swiss Francs, and Now Pay Dearly", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Piotr Szczepaniak, an apartment manager here, had just finished work, checking faucets and making sure rents were paid. After making himself a coffee, he logged on to a Polish social network and noticed that someone had posted the current exchange rate of the Swiss franc.\u201cI was frozen,\u201d he said, seeing that the franc\u2019s value had soared that day. Like hundreds of thousands of other Eastern Europeans, Mr. Szczepaniak, 46, is paying off a mortgage he took out in francs, instead of his local currency, the zloty.Central bankers are increasingly viewed as wizards capable of rescuing countries from the doldrums by printing money to manage interest rates and control currencies. But the monetary magic is unleashing unintended consequences on the global economy, financial markets and ordinary people.The move set off shock waves in financial markets and a one-day 23 percent spike in the franc\u2019s value against the euro.Many of the worst hit are average Europeans who took out loans in Swiss francs, often from foreign-owned banks, to take advantage of the far lower interest rates being offered.Poland has nearly $40 billion in loans denominated in francs, according to European Central Bank data. The borrowing, which accounts for nearly 8 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, has left Poland weighing its options. On Wednesday, the Polish government urged banks to convert franc loans to zloty at market rates.Poland is hardly the only country in this predicament. Austria has about $41 billion worth of such loans, close to 10 percent of its economic output. Other ordinary borrowers, from France to Croatia, have also felt the sting.Before the financial crisis gripped Europe, banks heavily marketed loans in Swiss francs, which were available at interest rates a third as high as for loans in Polish zlotys, or even lower. In Poland, there were 562,487 home loans in francs in 2013, representing almost a third of the total number of mortgages, according to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority.Poland is a country that is still getting used to the idea of mortgages. Many Poles who took out loans were the first in their family to do so.\u201cIt was quite a shock for my parents,\u201d said Rafal Jackowski, 39, a marketing executive who took out a loan in francs for an apartment in Krakow in 2004.\u201cThey said, \u2018My God, you can pay that much?'\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe were not used to spending money that we don\u2019t have.\u201dBut borrowers unknowingly became amateur currency traders in a fast-moving game that has affected many professionals.Mr. Szczepaniak, married and the father of a 13-year-old boy, recently joined a Facebook support group whose name translates to \u201cTricked Into Francs,\u201d where he exchanges stories with other Poles.\u201cThey are terrified, they are scared, and they pray that the government does something,\u201d he said. On a recent morning, his son, Krzysztof, was watching the Disney Channel dubbed into Polish while Mr. Szczepaniak showed a chart of the movement of the franc against the zloty since he took out his loan in 2003.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem scary at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth the Polish and Swiss economy were very stable, and the foreign exchange rates were predictable.\u201dSince then, the franc\u2019s relative value has increased more than 40 percent.In many ways, he is lucky. He took out his mortgage relatively early in the cycle. He said he got a 4.65 percent loan in francs, versus the 10 to 12 percent he would have paid in zlotys at the time. He can afford the increase, which amounts to $70 a month.Others are in far deeper trouble.Katarzyna Szczerbowska, a 43-year-old writer, said she was advised by a financial consultant when she bought a two-story apartment in 2008.\u201cThe adviser said Swiss francs were the best option because the interest rates were lower and the currency rates were stable,\u201d she said.\u201cEverybody around me advised me to take a mortgage in Swiss francs,\u201d she added. \u201cEverybody else was doing the same thing.\u201dShe says she is now so far behind on her payments, and feels so trapped by her accumulating debts, that she has contemplated suicide.She learned on Facebook of the Swiss central bank\u2019s action the morning it happened. She immediately began calling her bank and kept calling all day, but could not get through.Over the last five years, her payments have doubled to about $2,000 a month. A few months ago, her boyfriend \u2014 the father of her 20-year-old daughter \u2014 went abroad to help cover the added costs by getting a job in a factory.When she first took out her loan, the United States was already in the grip of a financial crisis, but its impact on Europe was still not clear.\u201cEverybody kept saying that the crisis in the States was very local \u2014 nobody knew why \u2014 but it was the U.S. that had problems,\u201d Ms. Szczerbowska said. \u201cPeople had to be idiots to think the crisis wouldn\u2019t spread. Unfortunately, I was the idiot.\u201dBecause Poland also had a housing bubble that collapsed during the crisis, many who borrowed in francs are now underwater.Leszek Wolany bought a small house in Warsaw in 2006. He took out his loan in francs because of the favorable interest rates, and for years, it seemed as if he got a better deal. But things turned around, and his monthly payments have increased more than $100 in the recent run-up.\u201cI can\u2019t sell the house now,\u201d said Mr. Wolany, a 30-year-old father of one who works in advertising. \u201cThe loan is bigger than the house is worth.\u201dLast year, Hungary, facing a similar problem, forced banks to convert home loans denominated in francs to Hungarian forints at below-market rates. The country was criticized for the policy, which chilled the banking sector.Poland, regarded as the model for Eastern European economic stewardship, had considered a similar path. The country\u2019s prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, said on Monday that she would side with the people over the banks.By Wednesday, Polish officials rejected the Hungarian approach. Mateusz Szczurek, the finance minister, said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the role of the government to be removing all possible risks people face.\u201dMateusz Zurawik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Premier Says \u2018Apartheid\u2019 Is Leaving Minorities on the Fringe ", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France on Tuesday cited a deep divide in the country, likening it to a state of \u201cterritorial, social, ethnic apartheid\u201d that has left part of the population on the cultural fringe.But during a traditional New Year\u2019s speech on Tuesday, Mr. Valls acknowledged that France had a deeply rooted problem that, he implied, had resulted in a divided society.\u201cThese last few days have emphasized many of the evils which have undermined our country from within, or challenges we have to face,\u201d he said. \u201cTo that, we must add all the divisions, the tensions that have been brewing for too long and that we mention sporadically.\u201d\u201cA territorial, social, ethnic apartheid has spread across our country,\u201d he said.Mr. Valls avoided singling out Muslims, but it was clear that his remarks were a response to the terrorist attacks this month and addressed growing concerns about the situation of \u201ctwo Frances\u201d that, he said, has relegated the poor and heavily immigrant population to ghetto-like suburbs of Paris, where many Muslims from North African backgrounds live.His comments came as public opinion of Mr. Hollande and his government has improved, largely because of the response to the attacks. But the remarks immediately drew criticism from some members of the political opposition and some Muslims.Mr. Valls spoke as the investigation into the terrorist attacks, the worst in France in recent memory, continued here and elsewhere in Europe. In Paris, four suspects believed to have links to Amedy Coulibaly, one of the three gunmen involved in the attacks, appeared before an antiterrorism judge, the Paris prosecutor said in a statement.The prosecutor called for the four men, ages 22 to 28, to be put under formal investigation on charges of \u201cterrorist conspiracy to commit crimes against people.\u201d One was also accused of carrying weapons \u201cin relation to an initiative to carry out terrorist acts.\u201d In France, the names of those not formally charged with crimes are not generally made public.The four men were detained and questioned by the police last week, along with eight other suspects, including four women. Agn\u00e8s Thibault-Lecuivre, the spokeswoman for the prosecutor\u2019s office, said that the police had freed three suspects on Saturday, and that five others had been released on Monday evening without charges.In a separate case, the German police searched 13 residences, mostly in Berlin, as part of a wider investigation into a mosque in the capital where people suspected of being extremists are thought to have sent money and weapons to Turkish and Chechen fighters in Syria.No one was arrested in the raids, carried out by 200 officers early on Tuesday, the Berlin police said.The French authorities also announced on Tuesday that five Russian citizens from Chechnya had been arrested in southwestern France and that a cache of explosives had been discovered in the town of B\u00e9ziers.But officials speaking at a news conference in B\u00e9ziers did not draw a connection with the investigation into the Paris shootings and characterized the men as being linked to organized crime. Yvon Calvet, the prosecutor in B\u00e9ziers, said that it was too early to draw conclusions but added that there was no \u201cradical religious context\u201d to the case, which has not been referred to antiterrorist prosecutors in Paris.In his address, Mr. Valls appeared to signal that the French government, while moving on several fronts to bolster national security, was now also turning its attention to the underlying social issues behind a cultural gulf.He cited \u201cdaily discrimination\u201d against those who do not \u201chave the right family name or the right skin color, or because the person is a woman.\u201dHe said that he was not looking to make excuses for those who threaten French society, but that \u201cwe must look at our country\u2019s reality.\u201dMr. Valls also cited a \u201ccollective fear\u201d created by the weak economy and lack of jobs, especially for youths, that was aggravating the divide.The remarks were more diagnostic than prescriptive. French officials have moved aggressively to prosecute those suspected of making statements glorifying terrorism and have denounced discrimination against minorities, but some Muslim leaders have also called on the government to do more to protect Muslims, especially in the aftermath of the attacks.\u201cHe is winking at the right,\u201d said Mohamed Henniche, president of the Union of Muslim Associations in Seine Saint-Denis, a region northeast of Paris, \u201cand this shouldn\u2019t come from a man of the left.\u201dMr. Henniche said the use of the word \u201capartheid\u201d contradicted the spirit of solidarity that had prevailed after the terrorist attacks and would fan unnecessary tensions with the Muslim community.\u201cIt gives the impression that the problem is the Muslims, but Muslims are the victims here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a problem with French people of immigrant background, but it is a problem of racism, of unemployment, of segregation.\u201dMr. Henniche said that if there was discrimination in France, it came from \u201ca minority of people\u201d who refuse to hire immigrants who live on the outskirts of big cities.\u201cFrance needs antidiscrimination laws, not antiterror laws,\u201d Mr. Henniche said.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

I\u2019d like to have a conversation about the new Republican Congress you just elected and how we plan to make Washington focus on your concerns again.We heard the message you sent in November loud and clear, and now we\u2019re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country.The new Republican Congress also understands how difficult these past six years have been. For many of us, the sting of the economy and the frustration with Washington\u2019s dysfunction weren\u2019t things we had to read about; we felt them every day.We felt them in Red Oak, the little town in southwestern Iowa where I grew up and am still proud to call home today.As a young girl, I plowed the fields of our family farm. I worked construction with my dad. To save for college, I worked the morning biscuit line at Hardees.We were raised to live simply, not to waste. It was a lesson my mother taught me every rainy morning.You see, growing up, I had only one good pair of shoes. So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry. But I was never embarrassed, because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bread bags slipped over their feet.Our parents may not have had much, but they worked hard for what they did have.These days though, many families feel like they\u2019re working harder and harder with less and less to show for it, not just in Red Oak, but across the country.We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they\u2019ll be able to leave to their children.Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like \u201cObamacare.\u201d It\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.That\u2019s why the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we\u2019re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve.One you\u2019ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. the president\u2019s own State Department has said Keystone\u2019s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact.We worked with Democrats to pass this bill through the House. We\u2019re doing the same now in the Senate.President Obama will soon have a decision to make. Will he sign the bill or block good American jobs?There\u2019s a lot we can achieve if we work together.Let\u2019s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let\u2019s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages and jobs right here at home.Let\u2019s simplify America\u2019s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let\u2019s iron out loopholes to lower rates and create jobs, not pay for more government spending.The president has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We\u2019re calling on him now to cooperate to pass them.You\u2019ll see a lot of serious work in this new Congress.Some of it will occur where I stand tonight, in the Armed Services Committee room. This is where I\u2019ll join committee colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to discuss ways to support our exceptional military and its mission. This is where we\u2019ll debate strategies to confront terrorism and the threats posed by Al Qaeda, ISIL and those radicalized by them.We know threats like these can\u2019t just be wished away. We\u2019ve been reminded of terrorism\u2019s reach both at home and abroad, most recently in France and Nigeria but also in places like Canada and Australia.Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief.For two decades, I\u2019ve proudly worn our nation\u2019s uniform, today, as a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. While deployed overseas with some of America\u2019s finest men and women, I\u2019ve seen just how dangerous these kinds of threats can be.The forces of violence and oppression don\u2019t care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them.We must also honor America\u2019s veterans. These men and women have sacrificed so much in defense of our freedoms and our way of life. They deserve nothing less than the benefits they were promised and a quality of care we can be all be proud of.These are important issues the new Congress plans to address.We\u2019ll also keep fighting to repeal and replace a health care law that\u2019s hurt so many hardworking families, we\u2019ll work to correct executive overreach, we\u2019ll propose ideas that aim to cut wasteful spending and balance the budget with meaningful reforms, not higher taxes like the president has proposed, we\u2019ll advance solutions to prevent the kind of cyber attacks we\u2019ve seen recently, we\u2019ll work to confront Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, and we\u2019ll defend life, because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society.Congress is back to work on your behalf, ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again.We know America faces big challenges, but history has shown there\u2019s nothing our nation, and our people, can\u2019t accomplish.Just look at my parents and grandparents.They had very little to call their own except the sweat on their brow and the dirt on their hands. But they worked, they sacrificed, and they dreamed big dreams for their children and grandchildren.And because they did, an ordinary Iowan like me has had some truly extraordinary opportunities \u2014 because they showed me that you don\u2019t need to come from wealth or privilege to make a difference. You just need the freedom to dream big, and a whole lot of hard work.The new Republican Congress you elected is working to make Washington understand that too. And with a little cooperation from the president, we can get Washington working again.Thank you for allowing me to speak with you tonight.May God bless this great country of ours, the brave Americans serving in uniform on our behalf, and you, the hardworking men and women who make the United States of America the greatest nation the world has ever known.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Next Year in Havana", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCuba is the idiosyncratic sister of the Caribbean, and a large part of its idiosyncrasy stems from having watched as the last half-century passed it by. What was once a cultural hotbed moldered under Communism. Still, there is an embattled dignity in Havana\u2019s dilapidated architecture, whether colonial style or Art Deco or even the midcentury classics; nowhere else does the traveler find this peculiar marriage between the contemporary and the antiquated, with its incongruous traces of the space age, of Spanish flair and Soviet flotsam. There is, too, a unique resilience among Cubans themselves, whose talent for improvisation, for making do with what\u2019s at hand, is legendary. The feeling of living in frozen time is one of Cuba\u2019s most frustrating realities and its most powerful allure. To imagine Cuba without it evokes an almost existential question.The specter of a thaw is what motivated me, back in 2009, to press my father \u2014 an exile who arrived in the United States in 1962 at age 15, along with his younger brother \u2014 to see the island sooner rather than later. For more than 40 years, he refused to send a penny in its direction, either as remittance for his cousins (as it did many others, the revolution fractured our family) or as a tourist himself. That summer, he finally acquiesced, seeking to reconcile with his family and to discover what had become of his country.Many of us \u2014 Cubans, exiles and second-generation Cuban-Americans \u2014 admire the anachronistic surfaces while also looking past them to see something else emerging. For years, Cuba has been much more than just jerry-built Chevys with Mitsubishi engines; Audis have been gliding through the streets of Havana for some time; mobile technology is increasingly common. A tourist economy fed by visitors from around the world has fueled a slow-motion modernization. Most of those hailing from the United States have been Cuban-Americans returning to see loved ones, but an increasing number are those with no familial connection to the island, just a fascination with its culture and contraband mystique.Every time I visit Cuba, even as I come across sights I must have seen a thousand times \u2014 the channels of Habana Vieja, the breathtaking vistas of Vi\u00f1ales \u2014 I\u2019m compelled to dive back in and work my way through the country. To be clear, this is what you do there: Work your way through it. Leisure left long ago. Instead, the sublime is found in the haggling and hustling and negotiations, in the aesthetic overabundance of color and music and traffic and weather and strays \u2014 in a sensuality evident in the pictures on these pages, taken in Havana for The New York Times in December.Congress is not likely to lift the calcified embargo against Cuba any time soon; but by itself, President Obama\u2019s executive order to normalize diplomatic relations is expected to have a profound effect on how the two countries engage each other, simply by allowing more Americans to immerse themselves in Cuba\u2019s culture. In doing so, the thinking goes, Americans will begin to empower Cubans by doing what tourists do best: hiring drivers, renting rooms, buying meals and souvenirs \u2014 spending money. Through these practical transactions, Obama said, American tourists will inevitably do the diplomatic work of sharing their values while \u201cmaking the lives of ordinary Cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous.\u201dActual prosperity is still a long way off, but with an influx of American visitors spending money with fewer restrictions, it seems reasonable to imagine that the Cuban talent for improvisation will evolve beyond just having to make do, to seizing the opportunity at hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Plan: Allow Drilling in Atlantic, but Limit It in Arctic", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration moved Tuesday to open up a vast stretch of East Coast waters to oil and gas drilling, a decision that could have a profound impact on the economic and environmental future of states from Virginia to Georgia. The move also adds a new dimension to the legacy of President Obama. In an announcement that outraged environmentalists and brought grudging cheers from the oil and gas industry, the Interior Department unveiled the latest part of its five-year plan for the government to sell leases for oil and gas development in federal waters from 2017 to 2022. The plan would open up one lease sale area off the southeast stretch of the Atlantic Seaboard, an area the oil industry has long hungered to exploit. It would also open new portions of the Gulf of Mexico, which is already open to drilling. And in a move that appeased environmentalists but angered Alaskan Republicans, it will ban drilling in portions of the Arctic Ocean\u2019s Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Environmentalists said opening the Atlantic waters would put the coasts of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia at risk for an environmental disaster like the BP spill that struck the Gulf Coast in 2010, when millions of barrels of oil washed ashore after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig. Advocacy groups in those states said that the drilling could harm tourism, fishing and other coastal industries that are already major drivers of the Southeastern economy. But lawmakers from both parties in those coastal states have pushed for years to open their waters for drilling. The Interior Department estimates there are 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the Atlantic\u2019s outer continental shelf and 31.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.The estimates are based on seismic surveys done in the early 1980s, and energy industry experts say the true reserves may be far higher. In opening up the waters to drilling, coastal states see the opportunity for billions of dollars in new revenue and royalties to flow from oil companies to state coffers, which would help pay for roads and schools and fill in budget shortfalls left by the recession. For the president, the proposal is a new chapter in his complex and evolving environmental legacy. In announcing the drilling now, he is trying to achieve a balancing act on energy and the environment that he failed to achieve in his first term, in large part because of the BP disaster. Throughout his six years in office, he has tried to push a sweeping, aggressive and controversial plan to fight climate change while offering an appeasement to his opponents in the oil industry and the Republican Party.\u201cHe giveth, and he taketh away,\u201d said Kevin Book, an analyst at Clearview Energy Partners, a Washington analysis firm, of the president\u2019s strategy. \u201cThe pairing of environmental policy with energy policy is something that, conceptually, this administration has done since the first term. Sometimes it looks like a balancing act, sometimes it\u2019s serendipitous.\u201dIn early 2010, while trying to push a climate change bill through the Senate, Mr. Obama\u2019s Interior Department put forth its first five-year plan for oil and gas development, which opened up the Atlantic coast for offshore drilling. The pairing of the two policies was done to ease opposition from Senate Republicans to the climate change bill. But after the deadly April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon, Mr. Obama withdrew the proposal for Atlantic drilling. A few months later the climate bill died in the Senate. Five years later he is trying again, this time trying to force through a historic climate change policy by using his executive authority to push Environmental Protection Agency regulations on planet-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants. The regulations, if enacted, could force states to shutter hundreds of coal plants in a transition to clean and renewable energy, and they have prompted fierce opposition from Republican governors. But the new offshore drilling plan won praise from some of them. Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, a Republican who is a fiercely conservative opponent of Mr. Obama\u2019s energy and climate change policies, said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Obama was \u201ctaking a step in the right direction to help North Carolina become a significant energy-producing state.\u201d Mr. McCrory added that oil and gas drilling would \u201ccreate thousands of good paying jobs, spur activity in a host of associated industries, generate billions of dollars in tax revenue and move America closer to energy independence.\u201dMr. McCrory and other Southeastern governors envision a future in which new offshore drilling stimulates job growth and new onshore industries that support it, aligning Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia with states like Texas and Louisiana as major offshore oil producers.But local advocacy groups fear not only oil spills but also the destruction of a distinctive coastal economy. Administration officials pointed out on Tuesday that the proposal would be subject to revision. Interior Department officials said that they expected to hold over 20 public hearings on the plan, but it does not require congressional approval. Ms. Weaver said environmental groups would gear up to fight the proposals.Environmental advocates noted that since the 2010 BP spill, Congress has not passed any new law intended to tighten safety regulations on the offshore oil industry. But Interior Department officials said they were planning to put forth new regulations ahead of the new drilling.\u201cAs a result of that incident, there were investigations to reduce the likelihood of problems in the future,\u201d said Janice Schneider, the Interior Department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management. Ms. Schneider said the agency was working with the industry to develop regulations on improved technology to prevent blowouts in offshore drilling rigs. \u201cWe are working actively to get those proposed rules out on the street as soon as possible, and working with industry to ensure those rules reflect the best technology,\u201d she said.Interior Department officials said the drilling in the Atlantic would take place a minimum of 50 miles offshore so that it would not get in the way of the Navy\u2019s military exercises, offshore wind turbines, and commercial and recreational fishing.Ms. Jewell said that since so little was known about the proposed Atlantic lease sale areas, the coming years would be devoted to exploration of the area to determine the extent of its oil and gas resources and ecological sensitivity. She said that the government was unlikely to sell a drilling lease before 2021, meaning it could be a decade before new drilling begins. \u201cIn the Atlantic, we know very little,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "How Mexicans Became Americans", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSOUTH GATE, Calif. \u2014 A FEW weeks ago, the City Council in this suburb southeast of Los Angeles appointed a Mexican immigrant to its advisory council. Jesus Miranda is from Michoac\u00e1n and owns a taco restaurant here. He\u2019ll advise the council on housing development and other issues. Mr. Miranda\u2019s appointment is hardly national news. But small moments like these are signs of a historic change of heart toward America and civic engagement among Mexican immigrants, many of whom, like Mr. Miranda, have been here for decades. No place offers a clearer view of this change than the suburbs southeast of Los Angeles. South Gate (pop. 96,000) and its neighbors were mostly farmland until the 1930s, when migrants from the Midwest and later World War II veterans moved to work in the factories of Chrysler, G.M., Firestone and Bethlehem Steel. Subdivisions sprouted. Towns emerged with bucolic names: Maywood, Huntington Park, Bell Gardens. Union jobs sustained a civic ecosystem of local newspapers, Rotary Clubs and Fourth of July parades. Then, in the late 1970s, the factories started leaving, and so did the white people. Their civic institutions atrophied. By 1990, towns like South Gate that had been 90 percent white were more than 90 percent Latino. The new residents, crucially, were not from East Los Angeles, where Mexican-Americans had developed an activist political tradition since the 1960s. Instead, they were Mexican, straight from the ranchos \u2014 small villages on Mexico\u2019s frontiers, far from the center and from government. Most came here to work in jobs they believed, even after decades, would be temporary. They focused their lives on returning home someday. They packed into cheap housing and spent their savings on building homes back in Mexico.Mexican rancho culture valued self-reliance and hard work. But rancheros also shunned politics, and, in particular, the paternalistic embrace of the PRI, the party that ran Mexico like Tammany Hall for 71 years. Immigrants brought that history with them, and in the dense southeast enclaves, their attitudes didn\u2019t change.This tradition of non-engagement, combined with Mexico\u2019s proximity to California, meant that this wave of immigrants was fundamentally different from previous groups in other parts of the country. Arriving in the United States, the Irish in Chicago, Italians in New York and Cubans in Miami came for good. They wedged their way into big cities using politics as the crowbar to more economic opportunity, and jobs in government. They had to compete with, and learn from, established groups and elites.This was not the case for Mexicans in the California suburbs. As the region morphed into a service economy, they easily found work. In 1986, Congress passed legislation granting amnesty to around 800,000 immigrants in Los Angeles County, many of whom eventually acquired citizenship. Suddenly many residents were voters, yet without any tradition of informed franchise or accountability. What\u2019s more, those who lived out in these Los Angeles suburbs had no one to show them a way to civic engagement. Not many had the education, or English, necessary to run a California municipality. Caring little for politics, they avoided city hall and rarely participated in civic institutions.In this vacuum, beginning in the mid-1990s, an astonishing cast of scoundrels was voted into office by immigrants casting the first votes of their lives. In South Gate, an unhinged brand of politics mutated, based on anonymous fliers. In 1999, one council candidate was accused, in a fake newspaper article reprinted in an anonymous flier, of molesting two boys. In 2001, anonymous fliers mailed to voters falsely claimed that two councilmen had fathered children they later abandoned. Tapping immigrants\u2019 deep connection to Mexico, fliers, in Spanish and English, accused candidates of being related to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the disgraced ex-president of Mexico, and of belonging to the PRI.These fliers seem clownish, but immigrant voters believed them. The council majority that won power paid voters back with classic PRI-style giveaways: free hot dogs and sodas at first, and then toys one Christmas. Once in power, it was police badges to cronies and millions of dollars to law firms.Eventually, enough voters woke up. Ashamed they\u2019d been duped, they recalled the treasurer and his cronies in 2003. The treasurer was later prosecuted and sent to federal prison. South Gate, however, was on the brink of bankruptcy.Most southeast towns, stripped of their civic girdings, have gone through similarly toxic municipal episodes.The town of Cudahy hired a former janitor as city manager, and an opposing candidate had a Molotov cocktail thrown at his house.In Bell (pop. 36,000), the city manager voted himself and others annual salaries well above that earned by the president of the United States. He and his former assistant are now in prison. Five southeast suburbs, in fact, had at least one elected official go to prison in the last dozen years.But each boil of corruption, once lanced, left its respective town a little cleaner, more chastened. Today, a virtually secured border has significantly slowed the flow of new immigrants who kept ranchero political culture alive. Mexico\u2019s recent medieval violence has also terrified many of those who are already here into staying put. As a result, many Mexican immigrants no longer cling to the dream of returning home one day. This change is happening across the United States \u2014 from Idaho to North Carolina \u2014 but it is most palpable in these Mexican immigrant enclaves of Los Angeles County. \u201cI get the sense that folks now see this as home,\u201d said Jorge Morales, a South Gate city councilman and son of Mexican immigrants. \u201cMy parents always talked about going back to Mexico. Now it\u2019s a place they\u2019ll visit, but this is home.\u201d The Azalea Regional Shopping Center, as it was named instead, held a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony last month, at which members of South Gate\u2019s Girl Scout Troop 16325, Latinas all, sang \u201cJingle Bells\u201d and \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201d No Girl Scout troop had existed in South Gate for some three decades. But two years ago, a local mother got fed up with driving her daughter two towns over and formed her own troop. \u201cPeople are getting involved, coming out of their shells,\u201d Daisy Prieto, the volunteer troop leader, and daughter of Mexican immigrants, told me.St. Helen Catholic Church for years held toy drives for orphanages in Tijuana. This year, the drive benefited needy kids in South Gate.South Gate\u2019s experience stands as a template for hundreds of small towns in Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kansas and elsewhere \u2014 towns that have been rejuvenated by new Mexican workers, who now form their essential working classes, yet remain civically absent. When I started reporting on the southeast suburbs in the 1990s, they felt to me like one enormous Mexican rancho \u2014 the way the Lower East Side of Manhattan must have once seemed a big shtetl. Today, they feel like an iceberg finally separating and floating away from mother Mexico. People are more focused on how things run where they raise children than in villages they\u2019ll never return to.It\u2019s taken a long time. But it is a good thing for Mexican immigrants and for the small American towns where so many have landed. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bond-Buying Programs: Simple in Theory but Complex in Eurozone", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. and A.FRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank is widely expected to announce on Thursday that it will finally begin buying government bonds as part of a so-called quantitative easing program.In principle, quantitative easing is simple \u2014 print money, buy bonds. The idea is to pump money into the economy, encourage more lending and stimulate growth. Such bond-buying programs by the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England were largely considered successful.But the eurozone is not a country. It is a currency union with 19 members, each with its own government bonds and its own politics. That makes quantitative easing in the eurozone much more complicated.Here is a guide to Q.E., euro style.The European Central Bank is expected to announce a broad bond-buying program, like the quantitative easing program that largely proved successful in the United States and Britain.Q. What is the point of quantitative easing?The low inflation trap is especially pernicious, prompting consumers to delay purchases and companies to put off investment. If it worsens, Europe could face the widespread decline in prices known as deflation, which hurts companies\u2019 profits and leads them to lay off workers.Once deflation grips an economy, it is very difficult to escape. Japan has been trying to break the cycle for two decades.In such an environment, central banks usually resort to cutting interest rates. But the European Central Bank has already lowered its benchmark rate to 0.05 percent, effectively zero. It has even imposed a negative interest rate on bank deposits held at the central bank.The E.C.B. has also been lending more money to commercial banks at rock bottom rates. But demand from banks has been tepid.So quantitative easing is the next logical step \u2014 and perhaps the central bank\u2019s only option.Q. How would the quantitative easing plan work?If the tactic works, it will ripple through financial markets, pulling down the interest rates on other types of debt, like business loans. The increased borrowing that results will stimulate demand and help drive inflation.Q. What kinds of assets will the central bank buy, and how much?Analysts have been saying that a government bond buying program of less than \u20ac750 billion will fail to impress markets. The bank, though, may avoid giving a precise long-term target and simply announce monthly purchase goals of \u20ac50 billion or so, similar to the strategy used by the Fed.As for the types of bonds, the central bank has already begun buying private sector assets, such as bundles of real estate loans. It could also buy corporate bonds. But the supply of private sector assets is limited, leaving government bonds as the largest target.The trickiest part will be figuring out how much of each country\u2019s bonds to buy. The eurozone does not have a single, Pan-European government bond similar to Treasuries, the main vehicle for quantitative easing in the United States. The most likely solution is that the European bank will buy bonds in proportion to each country\u2019s share of central bank capital, which is calculated according to population and gross domestic product.But other formulas are possible. For example, it could buy eurozone bonds in relation to the outstanding debt of each country \u2014 a method that would favor the most indebted countries like Italy and Greece. The central bank may also look for a way to avoid buying Greek bonds, because of uncertainty whether a new government in the country will honor all the its obligations.Q.What are the risks for Europe?Government bond purchases prompt fear and loathing in some northern countries, notably Germany. People worry that they could wind up stuck with the bill if a country defaults. Quantitative easing could alienate a significant number of Germans and reduce support for the eurozone coalition, which has already suffered because of the region\u2019s poor performance during the last five years.There has been speculation that the European Central Bank may try to address German concerns by delegating bond purchases to the national central banks, which in theory would absorb any losses. But the speculation highlights another risk \u2014 that the E.C.B. will make too many compromises and dilute the impact of quantitative easing. Critics say delegating to the national central banks would undermine the idea of a single currency with a strong central bank. Others say it might be necessary to mute criticism from Germany.Q. Will quantitative easing work in Europe?Another benefit, from a eurozone perspective, would be a weaker currency. The euro has already fallen substantially because of expectations that quantitative easing is imminent. A weaker euro helps exporters by making European products like BMW cars or French cheeses less expensive for consumers in the United States and other foreign markets.But the jury is still out on the impact on borrowing.European companies usually get credit from banks. By contrast, businesses in the United States typically raise money by selling corporate bonds.So quantitative easing may not be as effective in Europe. It is unclear whether pushing down interest rates on government bonds through quantitative easing will translate into lower borrowing costs for companies in countries like Italy or Spain, where the shortage of credit is most acute.There is also considerable skepticism whether quantitative easing will do any good at all, especially since the central bank has waited so long.The Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz called quantitative easing \u201ca last resort that isn\u2019t likely to work.\u201d Monetary policy can drive up asset prices and create a bubble, Mr. Stiglitz said in an interview, \u201cbut consumption isn\u2019t going to go up. Investment\u2019s not going to go up.\u201dQ. Will it affect other countries?The euro has weakened sharply in recent months, and that trend is likely to continue with quantitative easing. That downward pressure prompted the Swiss National Bank last week to abandon its effort to cap the value of its currency against the euro. Switzerland decided it was just too costly and risky.The move shocked the markets, sending the value of the Swiss franc soaring. The price has remained high, placing a huge burden on Swiss exporters and the tourism industry. Foreign currency brokers were also hurt; several went out of business.While other side effects may be equally unpredictable, policy makers and analysts have generally welcomed the central bank\u2019s action. A healthy European economy, they say, is good for the rest of the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Will Seek to Raise Taxes on Wealthy to Finance Cuts for Middle Class", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will use his State of the Union address to call on Congress to raise taxes and fees on the wealthiest taxpayers and the largest financial firms to finance an array of tax cuts for the middle class, pressing to reshape the tax code to help working families, administration officials said on Saturday.The proposal faces long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress, led by lawmakers who have long opposed raising taxes and who argue that doing so would hamper economic growth at a time the country cannot afford it.\u00a0And it was quickly dismissed by leading Republicans as a nonstarter.But the decision to present the plan during\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0speech marks the start of a debate over taxes and the economy that will shape both Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy and the 2016 presidential campaign. It is also the latest indication that the president, untethered from political constraints after Democratic losses in the midterm elections, is moving aggressively to set the terms of that discussion, even as he pushes audacious moves in other areas, like immigration and relations with Cuba.\u00a0The president\u2019s plan would raise $320 billion over the next decade, while adding new provisions cutting taxes by $175 billion over the same period. The revenue generated would also cover an initiative Mr. Obama announced this month, offering some students two years of tuition-free community college, which the White House has said would cost $60 billion over 10 years.The centerpiece of the plan, described by administration officials\u00a0on the condition of anonymity ahead of the president\u2019s speech, would eliminate what Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers call the \u201ctrust-fund loophole,\u201d a provision governing inherited assets that shields hundreds of billions of dollars from taxation each year.\u00a0The plan would also increase the top capital-gains tax rate, to 28 percent from 23.8 percent, for couples with incomes above $500,000 annually.\u00a0Those changes and a new fee on banks with assets over $50 billion would be used to finance a set of tax breaks for middle-income earners, including a $500 credit for families in which both spouses work; increased child care and education credits; and incentives to save for retirement.The initiative signals a turnabout for Mr. Obama, who has spoken repeatedly about the potential for a deal with Republicans on business tax reform but little about individual taxation, an area fraught with disagreements.\u00a0\u201cSlapping American small businesses, savers and investors with more tax hikes only negates the benefits of the tax policies that have been successful in helping to expand the economy, promote savings and create jobs,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code.\u201dThe proposal includes some elements that have previously drawn support from both Republicans and Democrats, including education and retirement savings proposals and the secondary earner credit. A tax on large banks was part of a plan proposed last year by former Representative Dave Camp, a Republican from Michigan who retired as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The proposal, which does not apply to charitable gifts, would fall almost entirely on the top 1 percent of taxpayers, administration officials said. It would apply to capital gains of $200,000 or more per couple, with an additional $500,000 exemption for personal residences.The remaining $110 billion to pay for Mr. Obama\u2019s new tax proposals would be generated by a fee imposed on the largest and most highly leveraged financial firms. That proposal, administration officials said, was designed to make \u201crisky activity\u201d more costly for the roughly 100 such companies in the nation with assets more than $50 billion. Those companies would be assessed a fee based on the amount of debt they hold.White House officials estimated that the new $500 \u201csecond-earner\u201d tax credit would benefit 24 million households. The maximum credit would go to those earning up to $120,000, and some credit would be available to those earning up to $210,000.Mr. Obama also wants to triple the child care tax credit, now an average of $550, and make it easier for middle-income earners to qualify, offering up to $3,000 for each child under age 5. White House officials said the plan would eliminate existing tax-advantaged flexible spending accounts for child care and reinvest those resources in the tax credit.In addition, the president is proposing to streamline a jumble of educational tax credits and give students up to $2,500 annually toward earning a college degree. Students who attend school less than half the time would also qualify for the first time, and more of the credit, $1,500, would be available regardless of whether an individual owed any taxes. The president\u2019s proposal would also increase access to tax-advantaged retirement savings plans by requiring most employers that do not offer such plans to automatically enroll their workers in an IRA. Mr. Obama has failed to find common ground with Republicans on fiscal matters, including during several attempts to strike a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on the budget. The Treasury Department proposed a detailed corporate tax overhaul in 2012 that would have lowered the rate to 28 percent from 35 percent and given multinational corporations a one-time \u201ctax holiday\u201d to return billions of dollars in profits parked overseas. But it went nowhere in the last Congress.It is not clear that this effort will fare any better. Advertisement"}

Poverty-stricken, jobless and without hope, living with their parents and siblings in shacks that lack water and electricity, lacking a vision of a better future: It is hardly surprising that their anger turns to violence.This is not an excuse but an explanation, and most youths living under such conditions do not turn to violence.France is by no means the only country with this problem. The Middle East is perhaps the worst caldron, and hopeless youths can be found around the world. To combat the ensuing violence, we have turned to military solutions, at an exorbitant cost in blood and treasure. Perhaps it is time to rethink our strategies.After World War II, with much of Europe destitute and in danger of falling into Communist hands, President Harry S. Truman created the Marshall Plan, which gave these fragile economies not finished products but the ability to manufacture them.The United States cannot and should not go it alone. It should enlist its allies in funding and administering a new Marshall Plan. Nor should we abandon military efforts to stabilize these regions.With thoughtful preparation and execution, a new Marshall Plan could become an important new tool in our effort to combat the expansion of global terrorism.

{"Headline": "In New Congress, Wall St. Pushes to Undermine Dodd-Frank Reform", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the span of a month, the nation\u2019s biggest banks and investment firms have twice won passage of measures to weaken regulations intended to help lessen the risk of another financial crisis, setting their sights on narrow, arcane provisions and greasing their efforts with a surge of lobbying and campaign contributions.The continuing assault on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law has achieved remarkable success, especially compared with the repeated failures of opponents of another 2010 law, the Affordable Care Act.The financial industry has been methodical, drafting technically complicated legislation that can pass the heavily Republican House with a few Democratic votes. And then, once approved, Wall Street has pushed to tack such measures on to larger bills considered too important for the White House to block.But House members also took up a narrower measure that would slow enforcement of Dodd-Frank requirements and weaken other regulations on financial services companies. The legislation will almost certainly pass on Wednesday with Democratic support, and although its future as a stand-alone bill is not bright, elements of it are expected to return on spending bills and other must-pass legislation in the future.\u201cThis all works together: Put it up for stand-alone vote, get some Democrats on it, and then when you push it onto a must-pass bill, say it\u2019s a bipartisan bill that\u2019s already passed,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which favors tighter regulation of Wall Street. \u201cThe strategy on Dodd-Frank is death by a thousand cuts.\u201dEven with other interest groups seeking the same consideration, the financial industry likes its chances.\u201cThere are limited opportunities for action in both the House and Senate,\u201d said James Ballentine, a lobbyist at the American Bankers Association. \u201cAnd the moving trains generally have a lot of passengers on them.\u201dProponents of regulation say that they are badly outgunned by an army of Wall Street lobbyists, and complain that the Obama administration has been too weak in its response.\u201cThe president was slow in drawing the same kind of line on financial reform that he did on health care,\u201d said Barney Frank, the retired chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who helped write Dodd-Frank.The current efforts to undermine Dodd-Frank have been textbook lobbying. In the first three quarters of last year, the securities and investment industry spent nearly $74 million on lobbying \u2014 on 704 registered lobbyists \u2014 according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That was on track to easily beat out the $99 million spent in 2013.The Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, Wall Street\u2019s biggest lobbying group, had spent $5.8 million alone through September, the last data available. The group spent $5.2 million in all of 2013.Lobbying expenditures by every specific industry group declined in 2014, except for the finance, insurance and real estate sector. That sector increased its spending by 2.5 percent.As of Nov. 16, Wall Street banks and other financial interests had spent $1.2 billion on campaign contributions and lobbying combined, a total that was on track to beat spending in 2010, when Dodd-Frank was being considered in Congress, according to Americans for Financial Reform.And Wall Street has been a steady donor, particularly to members of the House Financial Services Committee, where the legislation typically gets started. During the last Congress, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the committee, received donations on 13 separate occasions from political action committees run by Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.Of even greater importance, no influential business group opposes Wall Street\u2019s effort, making more Democrats open to the campaign. By contrast, while the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, might have powerful interests \u2014 like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business \u2014 against it, the health insurance and hospital industries, along with leading pharmaceutical companies, are strongly opposing its repeal.\u201cIn American politics, when a particularly economically motivated group gets behind something, that can be more powerful than an ideological viewpoint,\u201d Mr. Frank said, comparing his law to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cNobody who makes their money in health care is going after that bill. There are a lot of people making money in finance that are going after this bill.\u201dFinancial industry lobbyists say they are being unfairly pilloried. The changes they have won and further revisions they seek do not undermine the core of Dodd-Frank, they say. What has changed, they contend, is the rise of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose vocal attacks on Wall Street and its denizens have polarized the issue.Sam Geduldig, who represents financial services companies, called her a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\u201cLegislation now almost has a Warren litmus test, the liberal version of what is happening in the Republican Party with libertarians and Tea Party conservatives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Warren describes something as a gift to corporate industry, you have to kind of walk through that gantlet.\u201dSeparately, MetLife, the insurance company, went to court on Tuesday challenging its designation as a \u201csystemically important financial institution,\u201d a label under Dodd-Frank that allows regulators to impose tighter rules aimed at lessening risk-taking that might threaten the overall financial system.Administration officials say the tide is turning in their favor. Last week, the House tried to pass a measure that would delay by two years Dodd-Frank\u2019s requirement that banks sell off collateralized loan obligations, the bundled debt that helped cause the 2008 financial collapse. The bill was even titled the \u201cPromoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act.\u201dThat measure is now back on the House floor under normal rules that require only a simple majority to pass, and the White House has issued a veto threat against the bill, which officials said puts \u201cworking- and middle-class families at risk while benefiting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.\u201dBut those stands came only after other Wall Street-backed measures were attached to December\u2019s spending bill that funds the government through September and last week\u2019s bill reauthorizing federal terrorism insurance. Both were signed into law.\u201cYou can argue that of all the very powerful special interests that work in this city, Wall Street is at the top of list,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent and liberal populist from Vermont.For all its sway in Washington, Wall Street is also widely reviled. So, one of the secrets to its success is wrapping itself around a friendlier cause. Lobbyists have contended that measures long sought by the biggest banks and investment houses are actually for community banks, small businesses, farmers and ranchers.\u201cThey have been very expert at controlling the narrative thus far,\u201d said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Boston University Center for Finance, Law and Policy.One of Congress\u2019s last acts of 2014 was to pass a measure largely repealing a Dodd-Frank provision that required banks to push the trading of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives into subsidiaries that are not eligible for deposit insurance and other forms of government support. Members of Congress, echoing Wall Street\u2019s lobbying pitch, said the so-called swaps push-out rule was too onerous for small community banks.In fact, according to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, 95 percent of derivatives trading is conducted by five firms: Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. By keeping such activity under their federally regulated banking arms, those behemoths get to keep borrowing costs down.Mr. Ballentine, the banking industry lobbyist, said the chance of success had also increased as turnover in Congress reduced the number of lawmakers who voted on Dodd-Frank.\u201cThere is a strong possibility, a strong possibility, that every single sentence in Dodd Frank is not perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the newer members, they are not wed to every single word.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " Fox News Beats a Retreat After Gaffes About Islam ", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 First, the owner of the Fox News Channel incited an outpouring of ridicule for suggesting that all followers of Islam must take responsibility for the Paris attacks. Then the Fox pundit who is a self-described terrorism expert caused a second wave of stunned disbelief, asserting that some parts of Europe \u2014 including Britain\u2019s city of Birmingham \u2014 have become so Islamic they are off limits to non-Muslims.By the time the weekend was over, Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, the owner of Fox News, and the channel\u2019s pundit, Steven Emerson, had retreated. Mr. Emerson went further, issuing an apology to the people of Birmingham, where residents had posted hundreds of jokes via Twitter about his false claims.Mr. Emerson also said, \u201cIn parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound, seriously, anyone who doesn\u2019t dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire.\u201dIn his mea culpa, Mr. Emerson promised to make a donation to the Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201cThere was no excuse for making this mistake, and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake. I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham.\u201dThe Birmingham City Council responded with a statement in which James McKay, a prominent city councilor, described the comments as \u201ccurious,\u201d and said they \u201cclearly have no foundation.\u201d\u201cBirmingham\u2019s an incredible place, rightly held up as an example of how communities can and do live and thrive together,\u201d Mr. McKay said.David Cameron, the British prime minister, reacted less diplomatically to the Fox News broadcast, telling ITV News that Mr. Emerson was \u201cclearly a complete idiot.\u201dBirmingham\u2019s large and diverse population includes a number of ethnic minorities. As a local newspaper pointed out, the population is 21.8 percent Muslim, less than half the Christian population. Birmingham was once at the heart of British industry, but it suffered as manufacturing declined in the 1970s and \u201980s. More recently, it has remade itself as a center of the service economy, with prominent educational and research institutions and a vibrant cultural life.The reactions to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s assertions about Muslims were less charitable.On Sunday, Mr. Murdoch appeared to show some measure of repentance by joining those who had praised Ahmed Merabet, the French police officer killed on camera by an Islamic militant who had helped carry out the deadly assault on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper. In a Twitter message, Mr. Murdoch wrote: \u201cExtraordinary scenes in Paris today, but do not forget the heroic sacrifice of Ahmed Merabet, the Muslim police officer whose funeral was today.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a Twitter post by Rupert Murdoch on the Paris terrorist attacks paraphrased incorrectly in some editions from his comments. He said that Muslims must be held responsible for the attacks, not that they should apologize for them. Also because of an editing error, the article misidentified, in some editions, the parent of the Fox News Channel, on which a self-described expert on Islamic terrorism charged that the entire city of Birmingham, England, was off limits to non-Muslims. The parent company is 21st Century Fox, not the News Corporation. And because of an editing error, the article misstated, in some editions, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s title at News Corporation. He is the executive chairman, not the chief executive. (Mr. Murdoch is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox. News Corporation was spun off from 21st Century Fox in 2013.)Stephen Castle reported from London, and Robert Mackey from New York.Advertisement"}

It seems that investors have finally stopped believing those fairy tales.For a time, European leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany found a convenient excuse in the weakened economies of Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. Their argument went something like this: Europe will rebound once politicians in countries on the \u201cperiphery\u201d of the eurozone streamline their systems and reduce their deficits. The nations did much of what was asked: They made severe cuts to public services, pensions and other spending; passed laws to make it easier for companies and governments to fire people; and raised taxes.If anything, the euro\u2019s decline should serve as a mini-economic stimulus because it lowers the cost of goods and services produced in the zone for consumers in the rest of the world.

{"Headline": "Digital Tax Increase to Take Effect in Europe", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Europe\u2019s tax showdown could be headed straight to people\u2019s wallets.With the new year, a change in fiscal rules in the European Union is increasing the tax on many purchases of digital content like e-books and smartphone applications.Under the new rules, first approved in 2008, the tax rate on digital services like cloud storage and movie streaming will be determined by where consumers live, and not where the company selling the product has its European headquarters. Tax experts say Europe\u2019s revamped rules could add up to an extra $1 billion in annual tax revenue for European governments.What remains unclear is who in the 28-country bloc will pay most of the bill.\u201cThere inevitably will be a price change,\u201d said Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association, a British trade body. \u201cThe question is whether retailers, publishers or customers will have to take on board any increase.\u201dThe changes to Europe\u2019s so-called value-added tax \u2014 a tax on goods and services similar to sales taxes in the United States \u2014 are part of a continuing push by lawmakers to tax the region\u2019s digital economy more heavily. Companies like Apple and Amazon have been roundly criticized for housing their European operations in low-tax countries like Ireland and Luxembourg. The companies say they operate there legally.Many of the world\u2019s largest tech companies selling digital products, like Amazon and Microsoft, now house their European digital businesses in Luxembourg, where the V.A.T. rate is as low as 3 percent for e-book purchases. In contrast, countries like Britain charge companies a 20 percent sales tax for selling e-books. Analysts say the current rules provide an advantage to global companies that have the financial muscle to shop around for the lowest tax rate.Microsoft has said that charges for Skype, the Internet calling service, will increase for European consumers, as the company alters the V.A.T. levels in line with individual countries\u2019 tax rates. The European prices for Microsoft\u2019s other services, including game downloads, are not expected to change.Netflix, the video-streaming service that is expanding aggressively across Europe, does not plan to increase its monthly charge, and Amazon said that the cost of its annual Prime membership, which includes online video content in some countries, would not rise. An Amazon spokesman, however, declined to comment on whether the expected tax increase for e-books would be passed on to customers or if the company or publishers would eventually pick up additional costs.\u201cPeople will take their cue from Amazon,\u201d said Mr. Mollet of the Publishers Association, who added that the company\u2019s dominant position in Europe\u2019s e-book market gave it significant weight in setting pricing. \u201cIn the first few weeks, we\u2019ll likely see a lot of price volatility.\u201dGoogle and Apple, which run the world\u2019s two largest app stores, will also not reduce the 30 percent cut that they take from each digital sale. The American tech giants, however, will collect each country\u2019s V.A.T. charge on behalf of app developers. Some of those are expected to absorb the tax increases to avoid angering European customers, who are unlikely to welcome any increase in the price of games, apps or other digital downloads.\u201cEveryone is going to face the same problem; it will be tough to raise prices,\u201d said Andy Payne, co-founder of Mastertronic Group, a small British video game publisher. \u201cWill the V.A.T. changes reduce our revenue? The answer is probably yes.\u201dEurope\u2019s efforts follow similar attempts in the United States to pass an Internet sales tax that would force online retailers to collect sales taxes for state and local governments, even if the companies do not have a physical presence in the state. Congress, however, has yet to pass such a bill.The tax overhauls also come as policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic struggle to keep pace with technological advances. Since Europe\u2019s V.A.T. changes were approved in 2008, for example, companies like Netflix have significantly changed how they operate, moving to relying on Internet movie streaming that takes advantage of high-speed broadband and away from DVD rentals sent through the mail.\u201cTech developments are happening very quickly,\u201d said Gijsbert Bulk, a tax partner at the accounting firm Ernst & Young in Amsterdam. \u201cPoliticians are trying to find a way to tax the digital economy.\u201dOne of the European countries most affected by the tax change will be Luxembourg. The small country\u2019s low value-added tax rates have enticed Apple to set up its international iTunes business there, and Microsoft\u2019s digital download operation is also based there.Luxembourg\u2019s corporate tax system is being challenged by several European investigations into whether politicians gave preferential treatment to the likes of Amazon and a financing unit of Fiat, the Italian carmaker. And Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg\u2019s former prime minister, who now runs the executive arm of the European Union responsible for the continuing investigations, has been criticized for his role in promoting the country\u2019s low-tax policies.In preparation for potential lost income from value-added taxes, Luxembourg\u2019s lawmakers have announced an increase in the country\u2019s value-added rate on most goods to 17 percent from 15 percent, though it will still offer heavily discounted rates for e-books and some other products.\u201cLuxembourg is going to lose an enormous amount of revenue,\u201d said Karen Robb, a tax partner at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in London. \u201cThere will be fewer compelling tax reasons for companies to stay in Luxembourg.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Spending Is Back in Season in Washington", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBudget CalculusAmerica\u2019s partisan divisions are so familiar it sometimes seems the fight never changes. But on the federal budget, the battlefield has been transformed.Four years ago, when budget deficits topped $1 trillion, congressional Republicans turned their midterm election triumph into a spending-cut crusade. After forcing an initial springtime deal with Democrats, House Speaker John Boehner negotiated with President Obama on a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d resembling recommendations from a bipartisan deficit reduction commission.Those talks failed, leading to the first credit rating downgrade for the United States. Yet now, after another Republican sweep, the sense of budgetary crisis has vanished.Luck, design and political bungling all helped make that happen. Whatever the cause, the effect is renewed bipartisan pressure for spending increases \u2014 on defense, education, infrastructure and benefits for America\u2019s beleaguered middle class.\u201cSome things have gotten done,\u201d said Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of staff to President Clinton who embodied the push for deficit reduction through the commission he chaired with the former Republican senator Alan Simpson.In some ways, too much got done, Mr. Bowles said. He wants Congress to roll back the across-the-board \u201csequester\u201d cuts and revive talks on more challenging steps to trim Medicare and Social Security and raise additional taxes. \u201cWe\u2019ve avoided the tough stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the stupid stuff. I don\u2019t think it gets any stupider than the sequester.\u201dTo look at the government\u2019s bottom line now, you\u2019d think the plan he recommended with Mr. Simpson had been enacted. Total spending for 2014 came in about $300 billion less than their plan called for.The actual 2014 deficit, $483 billion, was slightly larger than the $455 billion Simpson-Bowles would have been expected to produce. That\u2019s because Congress didn\u2019t raise taxes nearly as much as the commission called for. Had lawmakers done so, Washington would have ended the year only $117 billion in the red \u2014 less than 1 percent of the economy.The vicious cycle of recession \u2014 which shrinks government revenues while expanding its public assistance expenses \u2014 has been replaced by the virtuous cycle of recovery, which does the opposite.At the same time, the continued moderation in the growth of national health spending has tapered outlays for Medicare and Medicaid. The cumulative savings, projected at roughly $1 trillion over 10 years, exceeds the amount of so-called \u201centitlement spending\u201d Simpson-Bowles proposed to reduce.The \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d tax-rate deal to increase rates on family incomes above $450,000 also played a role. So did the sequester cuts in defense and domestic spending.Some leading Republicans consider those cuts unwise because they crimp investments in future economic growth. That\u2019s been clear since the House two years ago couldn\u2019t pass a housing and transportation bill because it spent too little \u2014 at which point Hal Rogers, appropriations committee chairman, called for abolishing the sequester. Though Congress didn\u2019t do that, Republicans and Democrats did agree to ease those cuts for 2014 and 2015.With more Republicans in the House along with a new Senate majority, Republicans could launch a new spending-cut drive. Republican defense hawks vow intensified efforts to reverse sequester cuts for the Pentagon. In theory, Congress could do that by substituting new, deeper domestic cuts. But prospects for success would be dim. There\u2019s little doubt Mr. Obama would veto them.After concluding that government shutdowns and debt scares backfire on Republicans politically, Mr. Boehner and the new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, have sworn off those favored pressure tactics of their most conservative members.As they\u2019ve pulled back, President Obama has grown more assertive. On top of the $75 billion he\u2019s previously proposed for universal preschool education, Mr. Obama now wants $235 billion in spending for free community college tuition and middle-class tax cuts.He hopes his offsetting tax increases would raise $320 billion, leaving room for more spending increases in his budget next week. On Tuesday, for example, the White House announced that Mr. Obama would propose to nearly double federal funding for research and prevention of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Republican leaders rule out Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed tax increases. But as they join Democrats in signaling concern over stagnant middle-class incomes, they haven\u2019t ruled out the proposed tax cuts.Federal deficits promise to rise again soon as more retiring baby boomers claim their Medicare and Social Security benefits. The Congressional Budget Office projects the deficits will reach $1 trillion again by 2025.Washington can cope with that fiscal strain in a bipartisan, Simpson-Bowles-like deal if both parties fulfill commitments to overhaul those programs and if Republicans join Mr. Obama in accepting tax increases.Yet for Republicans, that prospect holds little appeal as they aim to win back the White House and control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2016. Raising taxes would violate a central principle of the party.Trimming Medicare and Social Security would not. But it has grown more politically perilous as Republicans rely increasingly on voters 65 and older. In 2012, they gave Mitt Romney 56 percent of their votes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand and the Coup Trap", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBANGKOK \u2014 Fifteen billion dollars. That\u2019s roughly the price tag of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to date. And it\u2019s the difference between the Thai economy, Southeast Asia\u2019s second-biggest, stagnating, as it is now, or its chugging along at 4 percent, its average growth rate since 2001.When a group of generals led by Prayuth Chan-ocha toppled the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra last May, their political agenda was clear: They wanted to quell a mounting legitimacy crisis. For many weeks protesters had been taking to the streets to condemn Ms. Shinawatra\u2019s management of the economy and a controversial amnesty bill that would have benefited her brother Thaksin, a former prime minister in self-exile whose political parties have dominated Thai politics since 2001. Now the economic consequences of the military takeover have become plain. The protests that precipitated the coup had already slowed growth, partly because of blocks on government borrowing, stalled exports and a restrictive monetary policy. And the situation has hardly improved since.The Bank of Thailand recently slashed its projections for G.D.P. growth for 2014 from 1.5 percent to 0.8 percent \u2014 compared with 2.9 percent in 2013, before the coup, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board (N.E.S.D.B.), Thailand\u2019s state economic planning agency. Rather than achieve what the official propaganda claims \u2014 order, stability, growth \u2014 the return to old-fashioned autocracy threatens to bring economic near-stagnation and will likely increase income inequality.The takeover in May was at least the 12th military coup in Thailand since 1932, the year constitutional monarchy was introduced. When generals have taken power in the past, they have used the opportunity to develop the country. There was rapid economic growth from 1983 until 1996, largely under Gen. Prem Tinsulanonda, who held office until 1988. Back then the economy got a jolt from a major devaluation of the currency (the baht) and a series of measures designed to promote rapid industrialization by encouraging foreign investment (mostly from Japan), infrastructure expansion and industrial exports. In theory, the current junta could also make a big economic contribution. But in a bid to scour the system of Mr. Thaksin\u2019s influence, the generals have been turning their backs on many policies favored by his government, including those that worked. Mr. Thaksin\u2019s signature economic achievement was to encourage consumption among lower-class people: His government provided access to affordable health care, gave out credits to rural communities, and created a transfer system benefiting poor students and old people. Today, the generals are reducing transfers to lower-income groups, concentrating on unfocused infrastructure expansion and taking no action to increase exports or tourism. This will not do in the face of Thailand\u2019s aging population and broken educational system, and of the global economic slowdown. Especially not when stagnation already threatens the social contract. The N.E.S.D.B. reckons that 0.1 percent of Thais own nearly half of the country\u2019s assets. Capitalist America, where 0.1 percent of the population owns one-fifth of all assets, looks like a socialist paradise in comparison. Some simple, well-known measures could do much immediate good. The central bank could spur stagnating exports and tourism by buying U.S. dollars to drive down the baht. The government could boost private consumption with a massive transfer program to farmers, students and the elderly. The Bank of Thailand could make credit more readily available by increasing the money supply, and it could stop using interests rate to manage monetary policy, which has not been effective. Yet the chances of such policies being implemented are low. The Bank of Thailand seems crippled by conservatism and uncertainty. Fiscal policy is in the hands of bureaucrats who are fearful of spending public money. The generals\u2019 own support base is too narrow for them to suggest, much less achieve, anything contentious. And some of their economic proposals so far have been essentially nationalistic and risk discouraging foreign investment. Every rational path out of stagnation seems blocked by autocratic rule. Thailand is not, as many economists argue, in a middle-income trap; it is in a coup trap. And this is a self-inflicted condition. To raise the economic welfare of all Thais, and reduce the economic inequalities that have underlain political conflicts, by our estimation Thailand\u2019s G.D.P. growth rate would have to be brought up to at least 6 percent. For that, though, bold measures are needed. Small and medium-sized investors need to be given greater access to credit. The financial sector must be made more competitive, including with the creation of new lending institutions, ideally more domestic commercial banks. The junta should also encourage more foreign direct investment in high technology, both to increase productivity in existing manufacturing (such as the automotive industry) and to spur higher-value manufacturing (such as for pharmaceuticals and telecommunication products).In the 1980s and 1990s, Thailand developed its Eastern Seaboard by turning infrastructure built in the Gulf of Thailand during the Vietnam War into one of Asia\u2019s greatest production and export platforms, especially for automobiles and petrochemical products. A similarly grand strategy today might be to revive this old idea: creating an alternative route to the Strait of Malacca, the world\u2019s busiest shipping lane, by digging a canal through the Kra Isthmus, in southern Thailand. A diversified manufacturing belt could then be developed along the canal, with two new great ports on either end. Another option would be to build a vast economic zone in the north and northeast of Thailand to supply the Chinese market. The generals claim to want to address all these issues urgently. They must adopt a bold approach to overcome bureaucratic inertia or else recovery will be slow. Reviving the economy is their single best chance of justifying the coup and stabilizing the country.

{"Headline": "The Economics (and Nostalgia) of Dead Malls", "Date": "2015-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce a thriving mall, Rolling Acres in Akron, Ohio, is now a crumbling reminder of better days.\u00a0Since 2010, more than two dozen enclosed shopping malls have been shuttered, and 60 more are on the brink, an analyst says.OWINGS MILLS, Md. \u2014 Inside the gleaming mall here on the Sunday before Christmas, just one thing was missing: shoppers.The upbeat music of \u201cJingle Bell Rock\u201d bounced off the tiles, and the smell of teriyaki chicken drifted from the food court, but only a handful of stores were open at the sprawling enclosed shopping center. A few visitors walked down the long hallways and peered through locked metal gates into vacant spaces once home to retailers like H&M, Wet Seal and Kay Jewelers.\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d Jill Kalata, 46, said as she tried on a few of the last sneakers for sale at the Athlete\u2019s Foot, scheduled to close in a few weeks. \u201cThis place used to be packed. And Christmas, the lines were out the door. Now I\u2019m surprised anything is still open.\u201dThe Owings Mills Mall is poised to join a growing number of what real estate professionals, architects, urban planners and Internet enthusiasts term \u201cdead malls.\u201d Since 2010, more than two dozen enclosed shopping malls have been closed, and an additional 60 are on the brink, according to Green Street Advisors, which tracks the mall industry.Premature obituaries for the shopping mall have been appearing since the late 1990s, but the reality today is more nuanced, reflecting broader trends remaking the American economy. With income inequality continuing to widen, high-end malls are thriving, even as stolid retail chains like Sears, Kmart and J. C. Penney falter, taking the middle- and working-class malls they anchored with them.\u201cIt is very much a haves and have-nots situation,\u201d said D. J. Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street. Affluent Americans \u201cwill keep going to Short Hills Mall in New Jersey or other properties aimed at the top 5 or 10 percent of consumers. But there\u2019s been very little income growth in the belly of the economy.\u201dAt Owings Mills, J. C. Penney and Macy\u2019s are hanging on, but other midtier emporiums like Sears, Lord & Taylor, and the regional department store chain Boscov\u2019s have all come and gone as anchors.Having opened in 1986 with a renovation in 1998, Owings Mills is young for a dying mall. And while its locale may have contributed to its demise, other forces played a crucial role, too, like changing shopping habits and demographics, experts say.\u201cI have no doubt some malls will survive, but major segments of our society have gotten sick of them,\u201d said Mark Hinshaw, a Seattle architect, urban planner and author.One factor many shoppers blame for the decline of malls \u2014 online shopping \u2014 is having only a small effect, experts say. Less than 10 percent of retail sales take place online, and those sales tend to hit big-box stores harder, rather than the fashion chains and other specialty retailers in enclosed malls.Instead, the fundamental problem for malls is a glut of stores in many parts of the country, the result of a long boom in building retail space of all kinds.\u201cWe are extremely over-retailed,\u201d said Christopher Zahas, a real estate economist and urban planner in Portland, Ore. \u201cFilling a million square feet is a tall order.\u201d\u201cEverybody has memories from childhood of going to the mall,\u201d said Jack Thomas, 26, one of three partners who run the site in their spare time. \u201cNobody ever thinks a mall is going to up and die.\u201dWell aware of the cultural dimensions, as well as the economic stakes, the industry is trying to turn around public perception of these monuments to America\u2019s favorite pastime: shopping.In August, the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group based in New York for the shopping center industry, including mall owners, hired the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller \u201cto put the real story out there and stop the negativity around the idea that the mall isn\u2019t going to exist in the next few years,\u201d said Jesse Tron, communications director for the trade group.While it is true that many thriving malls will continue to flourish in the years ahead, it is not clear what the industry can do to prevent more and more malls from falling on hard times.About 80 percent of the country\u2019s 1,200 malls are considered healthy, reporting vacancy rates of 10 percent or less. But that compares with 94 percent in 2006, according to CoStar Group, a leading provider of data for the real estate industry.Nearly 15 percent are 10 to 40 percent vacant, up from 5 percent in 2006. And 3.4 percent \u2014 representing more than 30 million square feet \u2014 are more than 40 percent empty, a threshold that signals the beginning of what Mr. Busch of Green Street calls \u201cthe death spiral.\u201dIndustry executives freely admit that the mall business has undergone a profound bifurcation since the recession.\u201cYou see the A-rated malls, the flagship malls, performing very well,\u201d said Steven Lowy, co-chief executive of Westfield Corporation, which has its roots in Australia but is now a major global player among mall owners. In the United States, Westfield has shed properties in the Midwest while focusing on the more affluent coasts. In Europe, Mr. Lowy prefers wealthy urban centers like London and Milan.\u201cOur business is more regional and high-end focused,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are gradients of dead or dying or flat, but anything that\u2019s caught in the middle of the market is problematic.\"Tom Simmons, who oversees the mid-Atlantic shopping center division of Kimco, another real estate giant, is more blunt. \u201cThere are B and C malls in tertiary markets that are dinosaurs and will likely die,\u201d he said, but \u201cA malls are doing well.\u201dBut there is a fuzzy line among the categories. White Flint Mall, a once-upscale destination in the affluent Washington suburb of North Bethesda, Md., is now sealed and awaiting demolition. A half-hour\u2019s drive to the east, in the economically and ethnically diverse Prince George\u2019s County, the Landover Mall was torn down in 2006, leaving empty parking lots and one stand-alone Sears, which closed in early 2014.Both properties belong to the Lerner family of Washington, who are also the majority owners of the Washington Nationals baseball team. Lerner Enterprises has said it wants to redevelop both sites, but there are few signs of it in evidence.Outside Akron, Ohio, the Rolling Acres mall has defied every attempt to redevelop it and now sits forlorn, with boarded-up windows and trees growing through cracks in the concrete. Before it was sealed, squatters occupied it and vandals pilfered copper wire for scrap.When it was thriving, \u201cpeople would come from all over in busloads,\u201d said Timothy A. Dimoff, a retired Akron detective who once advised on security at Rolling Acres. \u201cEverybody in Akron still talks about the caramel popcorn in the food court.\u201dOwings Mills may be on the verge of becoming a dead mall, but it is not in a dead-end market.The original owner of Owings Mills, General Growth Properties, sold a 50 percent stake to Mr. Simmons\u2019s company in 2011, and now Kimco is working to redevelop it into a hybrid of an open-air shopping center and enclosed mall.Resurrecting a dead mall isn\u2019t an easy process, however. Demolition of the old Owings Mills and construction of what is known in the industry as a \u201cpower center,\u201d with big-box stores like Costco, Best Buy and Target, would cost $75 million to $100 million and take two to five years, Mr. Simmons said. He expects Owings Mills to persist in its current, zombielike state at least through the end of 2015.Its demise, he said, was primarily because shoppers were drawn to other properties nearby like the more upscale Towson Town Center. Although Owings Mills was originally designed as a luxury property, the mall found it harder to compete after Saks Fifth Avenue closed its anchor department store there in the mid-1990s.\u201cThe mall genie was out of the bottle,\u201d Mr. Simmons said, \u201cand it was never going to come back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Output Seen Rising, Despite Fall in Its Price", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Even with oil prices continuing to plummet and oil companies decommissioning drilling rigs every day, the Energy Department on Tuesday projected that domestic crude production would continue to rise in 2015, although growth would slow.The forecast of even more American supplies on an oversupplied global market was not unexpected, but it added to the probability that oil prices that have plummeted around 55 percent since June will not completely recover any time soon.But the department projected a modest recovery for the Brent global oil price benchmark, now around $46 a barrel, which it said would average $58 a barrel this year but rebound to $75 in 2016. On Tuesday, both Brent and the American benchmark oil prices tumbled sharply, but later rose from their lows. The projection came hours after North Dakota regulators reported that oil companies had decommissioned eight rigs overnight, reducing the number in the state to the lowest level in over four years. North Dakota, the No. 2 state in oil production behind Texas, still has 158 rigs drilling, but only last month there were 183 rigs operating.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a massive downturn,\u201d said Howard K. Gruenspecht, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s deputy administrator. Mr. Gruenspecht noted that production in several areas of the country was \u201csignificantly locked in\u201d and that output in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico would actually be increasing.The decline in drilling, Mr. Gruenspecht said, will come in the shale fields of the lower 48 states, which have represented the heart of the American boom that has increased production by more than a million barrels a day in each of the last three years. Shale oil production will continue to increase through the first half of the year, but then decline in the second half, before picking up again in 2016 as prices rise again.Shale oil is generally more expensive to produce than traditional oil, and shale oil wells decline in production faster than traditional wells.The report was received with some optimism in the financial community even on a day when oil prices continued to swoon.\u201cThey are predicting a recovery,\u201d said Joel Moser, chief executive of Aquamarine Investment Partners. \u201cOil can fall to $30 and you will still see production continue. We are seeing price levels that are artificially low because of the echo chamber of commodity trading.\u201dGlobal oil prices sank to a six-year low on Tuesday after the United Arab Emirate\u2019s oil minister promised that the OPEC cartel would not budge from its decision in November not to reduce production.The United Arab Emirates\u2019 oil minister, Suhail Mohamed Faraj al-Mazrouei, suggested on Tuesday that the cartel could wait for American producers to reduce their production to shore up prices. His statements at an oil conference in Abu Dhabi came despite efforts by Venezuela, Algeria and Iran to persuade cartel partners to cut production.One reason oil prices have plunged in recent weeks is the growing fear of a slowdown in the global economy, and in demand for oil. But the Energy Department projected modest increases in consumption, both in the United States and abroad. It estimated that global consumption, which grew by 900,000 barrels a day in 2014, would grow fractionally by one million barrels a day in 2015. That is just a bit more than 1 percent.United States consumption is slated to increase by 300,000 barrels a day in 2015, while consumption in Japan and Europe is expected to continue to decline.Oil company executives responded cautiously to the report.\u201cThere is a complexity to not knowing how long this will last and where the bottom will be,\u201d said Danny Jimenez, chief executive of Craig Energy, an oil service company that operates in North Dakota and other western states. \u201cSupply has a number of different question marks; obviously one is the rig count and the reduction of the rig count here in the U.S. and what that is going to do to U.S. production. We have to be as cautious as possible and conservative as possible given the circumstances.\u201dMr. Gruenspecht of the Energy Department identified several wild cards that could send prices soaring again, among them a sudden change in Saudi Arabia\u2019s policy of refusing to allow OPEC to curtail production levels. He also mentioned the possibility of major disruptions in Iraqi oil production and exports or social unrest in other major oil-producing countries.The Energy Department report delivered more good news to American drivers. It projected that the average price motorists would pay this year for regular gasoline would be $2.33 a gallon, more than a dollar below the 2014 price, before rising to $2.72 a gallon in 2016.\u201cDecreased crude oil prices will keep gasoline prices low in 2015 and save the average U.S. household about $750\u201d for the year, said Adam Sieminski, the head of the Energy Information Administration.Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kicking Dodd-Frank in the Teeth", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe 114th Congress has been at work for less than a week, but a goal for many of its members is already evident: a further rollback of regulations put in place to keep markets and Main Street safe from reckless Wall Street practices.The attack began with a bill that narrowly failed in a fast-track vote\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0in the House of Representatives. It is scheduled to come up again in the House this week.Of course, you wouldn\u2019t know any of this from the name of the bill: the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. Or from the mild claim that the bill was intended only \u201cto make technical corrections\u201d to the Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010.Here\u2019s the game plan for lawmakers eager to relax the nation\u2019s already accommodating financial regulations: First, seize on complex and esoteric financial activities that few understand. Then, make supposedly minor tweaks to their governing regulations that actually wind up gutting them.A central element of the bill chipped away at part of the Volcker Rule, the regulation intended to reduce speculative trading activities among federally insured banks. The bill would give the institutions holding collateralized loan obligations \u2014 bundles of debt \u2014 two additional years to sell those stakes.The sales were required under the Volcker Rule, which bars banks from ownership in or relationships with hedge funds or private equity firms, many of which issue and oversee these instruments. Like the mortgage pools that wreaked such havoc with United States banks in the most recent crisis, C.L.O.s can pose high risks for banks.Now they want another two years.Although the top three banks had unrealized gains in their C.L.O. holdings in the third quarter, SNL said some banks were facing losses. And that was before the collapse in the price of oil, which has undoubtedly pummeled some of these securities.A second deregulatory aspect in the Fitzpatrick bill relates to the lucrative private equity industry, which remains loosely regulated. The bill would exempt some private equity firms from registering as brokerage firms with the S.E.C. Under securities law, such registration is required of firms that receive fees for investment banking activities, like providing merger advice or selling debt securities.These firms don\u2019t like that. But their investors could benefit from closer regulatory scrutiny of costly conflicts of interest in these operations. For example, a private equity firm providing merger advice to a company its investors own in a fund portfolio \u2014 not an arm\u2019s-length transaction \u2014 could easily charge more for those services than an unaffiliated firm would. Finally, the bill\u2019s changes in derivatives would reduce transparency and increase risks in this arena by allowing Wall Street firms with commercial businesses \u2014 like oil and gas or other commodities operations \u2014 to trade derivatives privately and not on clearinghouses.Trading on clearinghouses generates accurate price data that help both banks and regulators value these instruments. Because these clearinghouses perform risk management, problematic positions are easier to spot.If this change goes through, it will be the second recent victory on derivatives for big banks. Last month, Congress reversed a part of the Dodd-Frank law barring derivatives from being traded in federally insured units of banks. Taxpayers may be on the hook for bailouts, therefore, if losses occur in the banks\u2019 derivatives books.The Dodd-Frank law, as written back in 2010, was by no means a comprehensive fix for a risky banking system. And it is more vulnerable to attack, in part, because of its complexity and design. Dodd-Frank delegated so much rule-making to regulators that it essentially invited the institutions they oversee to fight them every inch of the way.And when Congress backs the industry in these battles, it\u2019s no contest.Still, it is remarkable to watch the same financial institutions that almost wrecked our nation\u2019s economy work to heighten risks in the system.\u201cThe truth about Dodd-Frank is it\u2019s pretty moderate and pretty compromised already,\u201d Mr. Stanley of Americans for Financial Reform said. \u201cAny further compromise and it tends to collapse into nothingness.\u201dWhich is exactly what Wall Street seems to be hoping for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pipeline and a Pie in the Sky", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Koch brothers Congress, purchased with the help of about $100 million from the political network of the billionaire energy producers, got down to its first order of business this week: trying to hold off the future.Meanwhile, here on the other coast, one of the most popular politicians in America, Gov. Jerry Brown of California, bounced into his fourth and final term by trying to hasten that future. The contrasts \u2014 East and West, old and new, backward-looking and forward-marching, the beholden and behold! \u2014 could not have been more stark.The 114th Congress is trying to rush through the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from the dirty tar sands of Canada to the Gulf Coast. The State Department has estimated that the total number of permanent new jobs created by the pipeline would be 35 \u2014 about the same as the handful of new taco trucks in my neighborhood in Seattle. This, at a time when the world is awash in cheap oil.Governor Brown, having balanced a runaway California budget and delivered near-record job growth in a state Republicans had written off as ungovernable, laid out an agenda to free the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy \u2014 his state \u2014 from being tied to old energy, old transportation and old infrastructure. He doubled down on plans to build a bullet-train network and replumb the state\u2019s water system, while setting new goals to reduce dependence on energy that raises the global temperature.\u201cThe challenge is to build for the future, not steal from it,\u201d said Governor Brown, who is the embodiment of the line about how living well is the best revenge \u2014 political division. He is 76, but said he\u2019s been pumping iron and eating his vegetables of late so he can live to see the completion of the high-speed rail system, about 2030, when Governor Brown would be a frisky 92.Russia, which is ranked below California in overall economic output, is teetering as world commodity prices provide a cold lesson in what can happen to a country tied to the fate of oil\u2019s wild swings. The Republicans should take note. The Keystone pipeline, though largely symbolic in the global scheme of things, does nothing for the American economy except set up the United States as a pass-through colony for foreign industrialists. Well, not all foreign: The Koch brothers are one of the largest outside leaseholders of acres in Canadian oil sands, according to a Washington Post report. I\u2019m sure that has nothing to do with the fierce urgency of rushing Keystone XL through Congress now.At the same time, the Republican hold-back-the-clock majority announced plans to roll back environmental regulations. Fighting hard for dirty air, dirty water and old-century energy producers, the new Senate leaders are trying to keep some of the nation\u2019s oldest and most gasping coal plants in operation, and to ensure that unhealthy air can pass freely from one state to the other. One strategy is to block money to enforce new rules against the biggest polluters.For intellectual guidance, Republicans can count on 80-year-old Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the incoming chairman of the environment committee. Inhofe calls the consensus scientific view on human-caused warming \u201cthe greatest hoax.\u201d He plans to use his gavel to hold back regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, fighting the obvious at every turn.The headache, for the rest of us, will come when the nations of the world meet in Paris at year\u2019s end to discuss how to address the problem that knows no nationality. We\u2019ll talk about China and its climate-warming coal plants. Critics will point to the United States, its knuckle-dragging Congress and the industries it is shielding from responsibility.The Republican agenda is frozen in time. It\u2019s all frack-your-way-to-prosperity, and Sarah Palin shouting, \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d The problem, of course, is that the world doesn\u2019t need any more oil, not now; the price is down by 50 percent over the last year with no bottom in sight. Cheap petro is killing not just Russia but Iraq, Venezuela, Saudi monarchs and, soon, assorted other dependencies \u2014 like Alaska and Texas. At some point, the only way the Keystone XL can be profitably built and operated is with a huge subsidy from taxpayers.Nature, also, is weighing in. Earthquakes in Texas and Oklahoma are raising alarms about the relationship between the hydraulic byproducts of fracking and the temblors rolling through a huge swatch of land that\u2019s been perforated for oil and gas drillers.Governor Brown and another West Coast governor, Jay Inslee of Washington, view the cheap oil era as a golden opportunity for an energy pivot. Inslee wants to tax the biggest carbon emitters to pay for new infrastructure. The motto is tax what you burn, not what you earn.Governor Brown is quick to note the big forces at play between the West Coast and the pollution panderers along the Potomac. \u201cCalifornia is basically presenting a challenge to Washington,\u201d he told reporters earlier this week.A big piece of that challenge is the $68 billion high-speed rail project, which would zip passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in just under three hours. It\u2019s bogged down in legal and financial muck, and critics call it pie in the sky.But Governor Brown is undaunted. What he has going for him is an old strain in the American character, dormant for much of the Great Recession \u2014 the tomorrow gene. There\u2019s no legacy, no long-term payoff, in defending things that are well past their pull point. And, seriously, which would you rather have: a futuristic, clean-energy train, or a pipeline that carries a product produced in a way that makes the world a worse place to live?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrew Cuomo Puts Bigger Challenges on His 2nd-Term Agenda", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning his second term only hours before the death of his father, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Thursday promised to confront some of the most deep-rooted challenges facing New York and the nation: unfairness in the criminal justice system, an eroded economic mobility and the distortion of the public education system from a \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d during his father\u2019s youth into a \u201cgreat discriminator\u201d for children born into poverty today.The governor\u2019s inauguration day began with an emotional nod to his father\u2019s absence, and ended with word of his passing. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be here physically today, my father,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cBut my father is in this room. He\u2019s in the heart and mind of every person who\u2019s here.\u201d Yet the expansive ambitions laid out by Mr. Cuomo in his inaugural address stood in contrast to the undeniable achievements of his first term, when he grappled with issues, like property taxes and gun control, that were important but held little mystery as to their solutions, which in many cases could be imported from other states.On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo called on lawmakers and ordinary New Yorkers to summon the courage to tackle broader problems, ones with neither obvious nor easy solutions, like reviving the upstate economy and addressing \u201cchronic high poverty\u201d in urban areas from the South Bronx to Rochester.Citing the killings of unarmed black men by police officers on Staten Island and in Ferguson, Mo., he said that some people had lost faith in the American system of criminal justice, and that it was New York\u2019s obligation to produce reforms.Alluding to the blindfold worn by Lady Justice, the governor said, \u201cToo many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact \u2014 or does the justice system now see black and white, or black and blue, or rich and poor?\u201dHe said the American education system, which once lifted up immigrants, had now split into two, \u201cone for the rich and one for the poor,\u201d and needed improvement.And Mr. Cuomo appropriated themes espoused by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won election railing against what he called New York City\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities.\u201d The governor lamented the wide gap between the rich and the poor and the lack of opportunity faced by hard-working people yearning for upward mobility.\u201cIt\u2019s time to be bold, my friends, because there is no small solution to big problems,\u201d the governor said.He held a second ceremony later on Thursday at a museum in Buffalo, the home of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s new lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a former member of Congress.In his address in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo expressed confidence in New York\u2019s ability to take on big challenges. He told the story of the construction of the Erie Canal and invoked the state\u2019s leadership on issues like women\u2019s suffrage and the gay rights movement, as well as two of the defining achievements of his first term: legalizing same-sex marriage and tightening gun laws after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn.Those votes showed Mr. Cuomo at his most skillful, seeing, and then seizing, an opening, something he suggested he would do in the weeks to come on the issue of criminal justice reform.\u201cHe is very astute at reading public priorities, and he\u2019s very fleet of foot,\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. \u201cHe thinks about how to play the game all the time, and so he\u2019s a master of it.\u201dAs Mr. Cuomo promised to confront big challenges on Thursday, he offered little hint as to how.While he will provide more concrete proposals in his State of the State address next week, the daunting nature of the work he promised to tackle was a departure from past years. In his first term, he showed his mechanical mastery of Albany\u2019s levers of power, but only sparingly tackled intractable societal issues.Robert J. Bellafiore, who was a senior aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, said Mr. Cuomo now faced the challenge of determining how he defines vast issues like inequality, and what concrete steps he can take to address them.\u201cAs everybody\u2019s mom always told them, actions speak louder than words,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s the actual follow-up that will decide whether today is just a good moment, or something that carries into 2015 and his whole second term.\u201dIn fact, at times in his first term, Mr. Cuomo seemed to struggle to produce big ideas. Others seemed reverse-engineered from the news releases his office created to trumpet them.Almost on a whim, Mr. Cuomo proposed building the nation\u2019s largest convention center in Queens, a plan that quickly crumbled. He put enormous energy into expanding casino gambling in upstate New York, even as analysts predicted the economic benefits would not live up to the governor\u2019s hype. He is building a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, but has not explained how the state will pay for it.At other times, Mr. Cuomo has contradicted himself. He promised not to extend a tax surcharge on high earners, but then agreed to create a new high-income tax bracket. He broke his promise to veto gerrymandered redistricting maps drawn by legislators to aid them in their re-election bids. He told the Working Families Party, a group of liberal activists and labor unions, that he would push for Democrats to take control of the State Senate, then barely lifted a finger to help them.And sometimes Mr. Cuomo has contradicted his contradictions. He traveled to Binghamton in 2013 to trumpet the virtues of building a casino in the area, then said last month that a casino would not cure the region\u2019s economic woes, then reversed course nine days later and called for a casino to be located there.The constant motion can sometimes undermine Mr. Cuomo\u2019s credibility: This week, he vetoed a bill that his own office had drafted.All along, Mr. Cuomo showed little interest in ideas from others, an insularity that frustrated some lawmakers.\u201cGreat leaders incorporate other ideas, or are willing to listen to other ideas,\u201d said the Assembly minority leader, Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua. On Thursday, though, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s eloquence in setting what could be an arduous agenda evoked memories of the man under whom he studied.Mr. Cuomo said he had spent New Year\u2019s Eve with his father, who served three terms, and had gone through his speech with him Wednesday night.\u201cHe said it was good,\u201d the governor recalled, \u201cespecially for a second-termer.\u201dRebecca Bratek contributed reporting from Buffalo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Czar Putin\u2019s Next Moves", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZURICH \u2014 Last March, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was quoted as saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on Ukraine, supposedly in defense of Russian-speakers there, was just like \u201cwhat Hitler did back in the \u201830s\u201c \u2014 using ethnic Germans to justify his invasion of neighboring lands. At the time, I thought such a comparison was over the top. I don\u2019t think so anymore. I\u2019d endorse Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comparison purely for the shock value: It draws attention to the awful things Putin is doing to Ukraine, not to mention his own country, whose credit rating was just reduced to junk status. Putin\u2019s use of Russian troops wearing uniforms without insignia to invade Ukraine and to covertly buttress Ukrainian rebels bought and paid for by Moscow \u2014 all disguised by a web of lies that would have made Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels blush and all for the purpose of destroying Ukraine\u2019s reform movement before it can create a democratic model that might appeal to Russians more than Putin\u2019s kleptocracy \u2014 is the ugliest geopolitical mugging happening in the world today.Ukraine matters \u2014 more than the war in Iraq against the Islamic State, a.k.a., ISIS. It is still not clear that most of our allies in the war against ISIS share our values. That conflict has a big tribal and sectarian element. It is unmistakably clear, though, that Ukraine\u2019s reformers in its newly elected government and Parliament \u2014 who are struggling to get free of Russia\u2019s orbit and become part of the European Union\u2019s market and democratic community \u2014 do share our values. If Putin the Thug gets away with crushing Ukraine\u2019s new democratic experiment and unilaterally redrawing the borders of Europe, every pro-Western country around Russia will be in danger. \u201cPutin fears a Ukraine that demands to live and wants to live and insists on living on European values \u2014 with a robust civil society and freedom of speech and religion [and] with a system of values the Ukrainian people have chosen and laid down their lives for,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, Ukraine\u2019s finance minister, told a Ukraine seminar at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. The U.S. and Germany have done a good job organizing the sanctions on Russia. While the Obama administration recently decided to deploy some American soldiers to Ukraine in the spring to train the Ukrainian National Guard, I\u2019d support increasing our military aid to Ukraine\u2019s Army now so it can better defend itself from the estimated 9,000 troops Putin has infiltrated into Ukraine. Ukraine also needs $15 billion in loans and grants in the next year to stabilize its economy, in addition to its bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Ukrainians had dug themselves into a deep, deep hole with their 20-plus years of industrial levels of corruption from a series of bad governments after Kiev became independent of the Soviet Union. The reason for hope is that the revolution and latest elections in Ukraine have brought in a new generation of reformers, who are rapidly transforming ministries and passing tax and transparency regulations. They are actually welcoming hardheaded, good-governance benchmarks as a condition for Western aid. But if they deliver, we must deliver. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has been traveling across Europe this week in part to lock in the aid package for Kiev. The U.S. has committed its share, but the European Union is still balking a bit. Putin\u2019s aim is to sow enough instability that the West will hold back aid so the Ukraine reformers will fail to deliver and be discredited. That would be a shame.Global financier George Soros, who\u2019s been helping foster Ukrainian reform, told the Davos gathering that \u201cthere is a new Ukraine that is determined to be different from the old Ukraine. ... What makes it unique is that it is not only willing to fight but engage in executing a set of radical reforms. It is up against the old Ukraine that has not disappeared ... and up against a very determined design by President Putin to destabilize it and destroy it. But it is determined to assert the independence and European orientation of the new Ukraine.\u201dUkraine could also impact the price of oil. The two biggest actors who can shape that price today are Saudi Arabia\u2019s new king, Salman, and Russia\u2019s czar, Putin. If the Saudis decide to cut back production significantly, the price of oil will go up. And if Putin decides to fully invade Ukraine, or worse, one of the Baltic states, and test whether NATO will really fight to defend either, the price of oil will go up. With his economy in shambles, Putin\u2019s regime is now almost entirely dependent on oil and gas exports, so he\u2019s really hurting with the oil price collapse. The odds of Putin fully invading Ukraine or the Baltics are low, but do not rule out either. Triggering a big geopolitical crisis with NATO is an easy way for Putin to shock the oil price back up. Putin\u2019s covert Ukraine interventions up to now have not succeeded in that. In sum: Today\u2019s oil price will be most affected by two men \u2014 King Salman and how he uses his spare capacity to produce oil and Czar Putin and how he uses his spare capacity to produce trouble.

{"Headline": "Sanctions for Peace in South Sudan", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter about a year of on-off negotiations between the government of South Sudan and rebels led by its former vice president, Riek Machar, the two sides have yet to make any meaningful progress. The violence first erupted in December 2013 after a power struggle between Mr. Machar and the country\u2019s president, Salva Kiir, which soon plunged the fledgling republic into civil war. Despite signing a cease-fire agreement in January 2014, and again in May, the two sides have continued to attack each other. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and nearly two million people have been displaced. South Sudan now ranks first on the Fund for Peace\u2019s Fragile States Index. Peace talks mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the seven-country security organization for East Africa, have stalled. Mr. Machar and Mr. Kiir have agreed in principle to establish a transitional government of national unity, but they disagree over the redistribution of executive powers and what to do with their respective troops. Negotiations have also foundered because of dissension within IGAD itself.IGAD is expected to hold sometime this month a special summit with its members\u2019 heads of state, and possibly other African leaders. This is a chance to break the deadlock in South Sudan: The warring factions and their backers are more strained than ever, and proposing a reasonable compromise, under the threat of economic sanctions, could compel them finally to prioritize peace.South Sudan is a nation of some 60 tribal groups with little experience of self-governance. Since its security forces broke apart, autonomous militias have proliferated. Many rebel fighters are civilian militias from Mr. Machar\u2019s Nuer tribe. Significant portions of the government\u2019s forces belong to the Dinka tribe. Fighting resumed recently, and with the dry season, it could intensify again.South Sudan\u2019s oil-dependent economy is nearing catastrophe. The production of crude oil has dropped by about 35 percent since the conflict began. That, combined with a drop of roughly 45 percent in global oil prices since the summer, has meant a substantial reduction in the government\u2019s oil revenues, and enormous fiscal and budgetary pressures. Since South Sudan exports almost nothing aside from oil and imports almost everything else, trade and monetary policy have also been buffeted by falling oil revenues. Access to foreign currency has become extremely limited. The prices of many imported goods have risen. There are shortages of petrol, which must be imported because South Sudan has no refinery. Yet if these economic strains are a source of instability, they are also an opportunity for IGAD to use economic pressure to broker a peace deal.  So far the group has been ineffectual. Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Somalia have remained mostly neutral in the conflict, but the Ugandan Army has fought alongside Mr. Kiir\u2019s forces while Sudan allegedly supports Mr. Machar\u2019s rebels. Uganda and Sudan are longstanding rivals and have a habit of fighting by proxy. But these spoilers\u2019 interests may now be shifting. The crisis is threatening to further shut down oil production in South Sudan, which would mean more losses of revenue for both South Sudan and Sudan, through which the oil is exported. The flow of imports from Uganda into South Sudan is also impaired. These economic difficulties come at an especially bad time for the presidents of Sudan and Uganda, both of whom face elections within the next two years. Now IGAD as a whole has more incentive to find a compromise between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar. The two sides have agreed to create a new post of prime minister for Mr. Machar. But while the Kiir camp proposes making the new prime minister a nonexecutive member of the cabinet, leaving all executive powers with the president, the Machar camp has argued for turning the presidency into a ceremonial position and abolishing the post of vice president. This deadlock could be broken, however, by reallocating more powers still. Mr. Kiir could be put in charge of the army, the intelligence services and foreign policy, for example, and Mr. Machar in charge of the police and economic policy. Mr. Kiir could be empowered to make judicial appointments after consultations with Mr. Machar.Another point of contention has been what to do with fighters. The government has offered to reintegrate into the security forces former members who defected, but not the civilian militias backing Mr. Machar. The rebels have been wanting both sides to maintain separate armies under separate commands.Considering the fractious tribalism of South Sudan, neither option will do. A fundamental transformation of the security sector is needed; it must become a professional service that reflects the country\u2019s diversity. All fighters who belonged to the army before Dec. 15, 2013, should be reintegrated, regardless of their persuasion. The elderly, the wounded and the illiterate should be discharged with retirement packages. Fighters who joined either side since Dec. 15, 2013, should be considered as applicants to the army, and screened partly with an eye to creating ethnic and regional balance within the corps.IGAD should urge the warring parties to accept these compromises under the threat of punitive action. Sanctions are often decried as ineffectual, but in this case, they stand a good chance of working. South Sudan is now dangerously dependent on Uganda and Kenya for food, on Sudan for exports of oil, and on Kenya for imports of fuel. An embargo on either oil or fuel would undermine Mr. Kiir\u2019s and Mr. Machar\u2019s patronage networks. Leaders in both camps have enriched themselves through corruption, and since some of this wealth is hidden in IGAD countries, it could easily be identified, frozen and confiscated. So far, South Sudan\u2019s warring factions have been insensitive to humanitarian appeals that they resolve the conflict. It\u2019s time for IGAD to test how sensitive they are to economic pressure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expanding Community College Access ", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe president\u2019s proposal deserves to be taken seriously by the public, state legislatures, municipal authorities and, of course, Congress, which will be asked to underwrite it. Although many details have yet to be worked out, the preliminary plans released last week call for an estimated $60 billion in new spending over 10 years to help cover tuition and fees for full-time and half-time students who maintain a 2.5 grade point average \u2014 about a C-plus \u2014 and who make consistent progress toward completion. The program would help as many as nine million students and would be open to colleges that offer credit toward a four-year degree or occupational training programs that offer certificates or degrees in high-demand areas. The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college for those students, and states that choose to participate would cover the remainder. If all states participate, the administration estimates, the program could save each full-time student an average of $3,800 a year. Some argue that the program is unnecessary because community college, where tuition averages about $3,330 a year, is reasonably priced and made even more so by the federal Pell Grants available to poor and working-class students. However, tuition accounts for only about one-fifth of the costs of attending a community college. These costs \u2014 as defined by the federal guidelines \u2014 include housing, food, books, transportation and other expenses. These are often insurmountable expenses for community college students \u2014 about one in three come from families with annual incomes below $20,000. Students, many of them struggling academically to begin with, typically try to make up the shortfall by working long hours. Their studies suffer, and they often drop out. This is a particularly severe problem in urban community colleges, where the three-year graduation rate hovers around 15 percent. But, as President Obama pointed out in his announcement, efforts like the Accelerated Study in Associate Programs at the City University of New York can dramatically increase student success, as defined by graduation rates and the rate at which students move on to four-year degrees. ASAP, which began in 2007, provides money for books, coaching, tutoring, tuition waivers and transportation. Fifty-seven percent of last year\u2019s graduates finished in three years. Despite higher upfront costs, the cost per ASAP graduate is actually lower than it is for traditional students because students in the program move through the system more quickly. One study found that for every dollar invested in ASAP, $3.50 in tax revenues and unused social service benefits was gained. As rules are written for the national program, the White House and Congress must make sure that only institutions with a demonstrable commitment to helping students graduate are rewarded. States should be required to sustain significant investments in their community colleges, revise accrediting rules so that community colleges are held to higher standards and make sure that students who graduate from those colleges can easily transfer to public four-year schools. The skepticism that has greeted Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in some quarters has overtones of the skepticism that greeted 19th-century educators when they began to agitate for free, universal public high schools. Their efforts proved crucial at a time when the country was moving away from farming and toward a world in which reading, writing and reasoning would be critical. Expanded access to community college could do the same thing for the country in the information age. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slow Rise in Consumer Prices May Stymie the Fed", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Consumer prices in the United States are rising at the slowest pace during a period of economic growth in the last half-century, a trend that could delay the Federal Reserve\u2019s retreat from its stimulus campaign.The slow pace of inflation means Americans are experiencing less erosion in the value of their paychecks at a time when wages, too, are rising unusually slowly. But it is also evidence that the recovery from the Great Recession remains incomplete. And sluggish inflation itself can impede debt repayment and other economic adjustments.Some Fed officials reiterated on Friday that they saw sluggish inflation as a temporary problem. They said that lower oil prices would actually help reverse the trend by contributing to stronger economic growth and, in time, increased inflation. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been expecting this given what oil prices are doing,\u201d Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cThe bigger question is what happens in the next four to six months. Will inflation begin to drift back up toward our target? I think that it will.\u201dBut Fed officials also have underscored in recent weeks that their policy decisions will be determined by the course of events, not by their predictions. And some analysts said on Friday that it seemed increasingly likely the Fed would once again decide to wait a little longer before finally raising interest rates.\u201cIn light of the downward pressure on inflation, we expect the F.O.M.C. will be \u2018patient\u2019 this year as far as monetary policy is concerned,\u201d Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy. \u201cWe believe the committee will hold off any increase in the federal funds rate until September, waiting for evidence that both total and core inflation have bottomed out and are beginning to rise again.\u201dThe Fed aims to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, and Friday\u2019s report is worse than it looks because the Fed prefers a different government measure that tends to show somewhat less inflation. That measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, will be updated later this month.Separately, the Fed reported that industrial production fell by 0.1 percent in December, driven mostly by a sharp drop in utility output caused mostly by a swing from an unusually cold November to an unusually warm December. A 0.3 percent increase in manufacturing and a 2.2 gain jump in mining, which showed that crude oil production was continuing to advance despite the drop in prices, offset most of the drop in utility output.The sharp decline of oil prices is a crucial factor in the low inflation figures. The government said the price of gasoline fell 21 percent over the last year, and analysts said cheap gas also appeared to be holding down the cost of some other goods and services. But oil prices cannot continue to fall at the same pace, and surveys of economists and consumers show a widespread expectation that inflation will rebound. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer survey reported on Friday that expectations for inflation over the next year declined substantially to 2.4 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December. Crucially, however, the survey reported no change in consumer expectations for annual inflation five years from now. \u201cThe bottom line is that permanently lower energy prices are a stimulus package for U.S. consumers,\u201d Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote on Friday. \u201cStronger final demand should speed up inflation\u2019s return to 2 percent, not slow it down or make it less likely.\u201dThe weakness of inflation, however, predates the collapse of oil prices. The Fed has not hit its 2 percent target in more than two years. And the data suggests other factors, including a strengthening dollar, are restraining inflation. The prices of imported goods like clothing and cars also have fallen in recent months.Notably, a version of the consumer index that excludes oil and food did not rise in December. The Fed and many independent economists regard this measure, known as core inflation, as a more accurate indicator of future inflation because oil and food prices are volatile, obscuring the underlying trend.Measures of inflation expectations derived from asset prices suggested that some investors had doubts about how quickly inflation was likely to rebound \u2014 and they are increasingly betting the Fed will wait until the fall to raise rates.The Fed, however, has not significantly altered its timetable in more than a year, and officials have said they will not wait for inflation to recover before acting. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said last month that it would be sufficient for officials to feel \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation was going to rebound.James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Friday that the Fed was being pulled in opposite directions by the growing strength of the economy and the weakness of inflation. He noted that the Fed had underestimated job growth and overestimated inflation in each of the last two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Groundswell Chooses Democracy in Sri Lanka", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From South AsiaNEW DELHI \u2014 Across the great Eurasian plate these days, from Belarus to Beijing, one can find leaders dispensing with truly competitive politics. But traverse the Himalayas to South Asia and the climate is different: Democracy is on a winning streak.The man who came out of nowhere to defeat him, a soft-spoken former health minister, Maithripala Sirisena, promised voters something simple \u2014 a weaker presidency. On Sunday, in his first address as president, Mr. Sirisena said Sri Lanka would return to a parliamentary system.\u201cWhat our country needs,\u201d he said, \u201cis not a king, but a real human being.\u201dEastern Europe had a period of democratic expansion like this, after the breakup of the Soviet Union. But the South Asian trend was not actively propagated by the West \u2014 or even by the local giant, India. Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist who has studied democracy in the region, said that India\u2019s influence was a subtle, slow-burning one, as Nepalese, Bangladeshis and even Pakistanis said, \u201cYou know, after all, India has one thing going for it: They throw out their politicians with regularity.\u201dBoth Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. Rajapaksa \u201cwere in for a rude shock,\u201d said Mr. Ganguly, a professor at Indiana University. \u201cThey thought their population would engage in this kind of mindless adulation, but an odd coalition of people came together to express their discontent. And, given an opportunity, people will use the power of the ballot.\u201dVoter turnout for Thursday\u2019s election was a record high for Sri Lanka, 81.5 percent, according to the Election Commission.A clearer picture began to emerge of the events that led up to Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s decision to concede the election peacefully on Friday morning, before the vote count was finished. A lawmaker with Mr. Sirisena\u2019s team told reporters that Mr. Rajapaksa had ordered the army to deploy throughout the country \u2014 a tactic some feared would be used to suppress turnout or even annul the vote on security grounds. But the army\u2019s commander refused.\u201cHe kept the troops in the barracks and helped a free and fair election,\u201d said Rajitha Senaratne, a lawmaker.A spokesman for Mr. Rajapaksa, Mohan Samaranayake, said that \u201cthere was no such attempt at all,\u201d and that the former president had assessed early counts at 3:30 a.m. and instructed officials to facilitate a smooth transfer of power, according to the news agency Press Trust of India.Brig. Ruwan Wanigasooriya, a military spokesman, said he was not aware of any such orders.\u201cI am not aware of such a coup attempt,\u201d he said in comments to Agence France-Presse. \u201cThe army was not involved during any stage of the electoral process.\u201dAlthough many foreign analysts were taken aback by the election results, subtle shifts had been going on throughout the six-week campaign. Civil servants, for example, began to display flashes of independence. When one of Mr. Sirisena\u2019s rally sites was destroyed in an arson attack in mid-December, a deputy minister and a number of his supporters were arrested. When the suspects were released, the commanding officer of the precinct resigned in protest, telling a local newspaper that he could not perform his duties \u201cbecause of political pressure.\u201dSuch events indicated that \u201cmaybe things were changing,\u201d and rumblings from inside the system became more noticeable as the election grew closer, said Alan Keenan, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. A long list of academics, many of them employed at state universities, signed an open letter condemning \u201cthe concentration of both political and economic power in the hands of a few.\u201d\u201cThere were a lot of people who had previously been quiet,\u201d Mr. Keenan said. \u201cThey had a window of opportunity where their voices made a difference, and where, if they didn\u2019t use their voices, they feared they wouldn\u2019t ever have another chance to use them. There was a window, and a lot of people jumped through.\u201dThe new president took the oath of office in a mobbed city square, his words inaudible in the clamor of a disorganized crowd, but no one seemed to mind.\u201cI wanted this change \u2014 we all really wanted it,\u201d said Ruchi Wijisekara, who was in the square. \u201cI feel that we have been freed from really oppressive rule. I think everyone here feels like that. This is why there is a carnival atmosphere.\u201dDharisha Bastians contributed reporting from Colombo, Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $210 Million Baseball Contract That Explains How Inflation Works", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney PitcherBut forget the baseball dimension of the deal for a minute (after all, spring training doesn\u2019t begin for another month). The contract also offers a fascinating insight into inflation and expectations for future inflation. The issues that Scherzer and the Nationals probably considered in negotiating the deal go to the core of decisions the Federal Reserve and other central banks must make in doing their jobs.But this structure has some advantages for all parties. Scherzer will receive quite a generous income even when his playing days are done. Because a dollar today is worth more than that dollar in the future, stretching the deal over such a long time exaggerates the headline size of the deal relative to its economic value. This allows the team to get the player for a more reasonable price while the player and his agent get the bragging rights of a megacontract.Because the deal is reportedly denominated without any adjustment for inflation, both sides are effectively making a huge bet on the future path of prices.For example, if consumer prices rise only 1 percent a year through 2029, in the final year of Scherzer\u2019s contract, his $15 million paycheck will be worth $12.9 million in today\u2019s dollars. But if inflation averages 4 percent in that span, it will be worth only $8.3 million.That difference is real money even for a family as wealthy as the Lerners, who own the Nationals. In effect, the Lerners have made an implicit bet that inflation will be high over the coming decade and a half, where Scherzer has an implicit bet on low inflation or even deflation.We like to imagine that Ted Lerner foresees the onset of hyperinflation in the years ahead and that Scherzer forecasts protracted Japan-style deflation, but in the news conference announcing the deal Wednesday, the sportswriters present shamefully failed to ask about monetary policy.Presumably when the Lerners entered the contract, they did so with some idea in mind of their ability to raise prices for tickets, hot dogs and advertising rights at Nationals Park in the years ahead. They were willing to pay Scherzer a contract structured the way it is not just because they think he is an excellent pitcher who will win many games, but also because they will have an expanding pile of dollars out of which to pay him.If they then raise season-ticket prices and concession prices and demand higher prices from sponsors, in some small way consumer price inflation has gotten a little bit higher. In that sense, their inflation expectations become self-fulfilling.It\u2019s effectively a reverse version of what happened with many union contracts in the 1970s. Companies expected to be able to raise prices as needed, so they agreed to large wage increases for unionized workers. That became a self-fulfilling prophesy, as more money flowing out as wages just led to more money chasing the same amount of goods, generating higher prices.In other words, whatever level of inflation that key actors in the economy expect to occur is then more likely to actually occur. So when the policy makers who control the dials of the money supply meet eight times a year at the Federal Reserve, they have to worry not just about how much prices are rising today, but also how much those economic decision-makers expect them to increase in the future.But right now, the problem the Fed has is that financial markets seem to expect quite low inflation for many years to come. Looking at the gap between the interest rate for inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds that mature in 2029, the last year of the deal, implies inflation of only about 1.57 percent a year over the life span of Scherzer\u2019s contract. That\u2019s comfortably (or arguably uncomfortably) below the 2 percent the Fed says it aims for.Fed officials have noted surveys of consumers and businesses that suggest somewhat higher inflation. So they have been reluctant to react to bond market measures pointing to inflation below their targets by, for example, postponing interest rate increases.Advertisement"}

But a multiethnic movement that has emerged in recent years has given voice to a new generation of Guyanese who say that politics as usual has held the country back by favoring race over merit, undermining economic progress.\u201cThis shows the true reality of Guyana now,\u201d Marcia de Costa, 37, a manager of a beauty salon, said, pointing toward the diverse crowd at the rally. \u201cThis is new for us.\u201dThe two main political parties in Guyana have traditionally hewed to racial lines: one drawing support from the descendants of Africans brought over by the Dutch in the 17th century, and the other from the descendants of the Indians brought by the British a couple of centuries later.But the emergence of a third party in recent years has changed the dynamics.The multiracial party \u2014 along with the main opposition party, the Afro-Guyanese-dominated Partnership for National Unity \u2014 proceeded to block many of Mr. Ramotar\u2019s initiatives. Tensions rose last year when Alliance for Change said it would call for a no-confidence vote against the president in a dispute over government spending.Mr. Ramotar halted the motion by invoking a provision of the Constitution that allows the president to suspend Parliament for up to six months, infuriating the opposition and leading to a string of street protests.\u201cWhat I have done is given democracy a better opportunity to breathe,\u201d Mr. Ramotar said at the time, adding that he hoped the move would provide an opportunity for talks between his government and the opposition, though none have taken place yet.Despite the president\u2019s move to suspend Parliament, there is hope within Alliance for Change that the country has moved into a new era of more inclusionary politics.\u201cPeople realized that racialized politics in this country will carry us nowhere,\u201d said Khemraj Ramjattan, 54, who left Mr. Ramotar\u2019s party and helped found the multiethnic group. \u201cThey now realize that we have to start dealing with issues.\u201dYet despite its gains, it is not clear if Mr. Ramjattan\u2019s party can do much more than act as a spoiler in the sparring between the two main parties \u2014 or if it can come up with solutions of its own to revive the economy and promote growth. Much of its platform consists of general calls for transparency and constitutional reform.Guyana gained its independence from Britain in 1966. In the first three decades of independence, an Afro-Guyanese group controlled the government. But in 1992, the Indo-Guyanese party gained the upper hand in the country\u2019s first free and fair elections in that period, and it has controlled Parliament and the presidency ever since.That has led to widespread resentment among Afro-Guyanese, who say they have been shut out of government and business, just as the Indo-Guyanese said they were before coming to power.There are more Indo-Guyanese than Afro-Guyanese in the country; a 2002 census reported that 43 percent of the population was of Indian descent and 30 percent of African descent.The country remains one of the poorest in the region. Its main sources of wealth are sugar, timber and bauxite, as well as gold and diamonds. Guyana\u2019s governments have experienced an array of corruption scandals, encompassing things like procurement and unfinished building projects.Frustration with the status quo, particularly corruption, helped fuel desire for a political alternative. Defectors from both major parties formed the new multiracial party in 2004.\u201cThe country is suffering because we are not all working together in this racial divide,\u201d said Moses Nagamootoo, a leader of Alliance for Change who was among the prime movers of the no-confidence motion.Seated at his desk in his Georgetown office, Mr. Ramotar said that he did not think the political standoff was because of a changing society. Rather, he said, the crisis is a result of maneuvering by an upstart opposition seeking to gain power.Mr. Ramotar has pledged to use the time that Parliament is suspended to engage in dialogue with his opponents. \u201cI owe it to the people of this country to offer a possibility that we don\u2019t descend into rancor and give ourselves a possibility to reach a compromise and move forward,\u201d he said.But he added that if it came to a no-confidence vote and new elections, he was sure that his party would remain in the majority and that he would continue as president. The opposition has said it will move its no-confidence motion as soon as Parliament reconvenes, so it is likely that elections will take place in the coming months.Given Mr. Ramotar\u2019s dwindling popularity and a string of corruption scandals that have hit his government, there is a good chance that the current Afro-Guyanese opposition could be elected, ending more than two decades of Indo-Guyanese rule.Yet they may, thanks to the increased power of the multiethnic party, be forced to become more inclusive, said Vibert Cambridge, a professor of communications at Ohio University. \u201cThat ethno-political base will remain, but it will lose its salience over time.\u201d\u201cThis is a manifestation of what hopefully is the end of ethno-politics in Guyana,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may well be a pivotal moment in Guyanese 21st-century history.\u201dLeaders of Alliance for Change hope that a growing mixed-race population will become part of its natural base and help it build support. Its message appears to have particular appeal to younger voters, who may have seen more of the world and want to change things at home. \u201cThat generation is questioning this kind of traditional politics,\u201d Mr. Cambridge said.Advertisement"}

Fallon makes a point that anyone concerned about Haiti or even global poverty must consider. Haiti\u2019s economy cannot remain dependent on nongovernmental organizations and aid agencies. This help must be accompanied by means that foster economic independence. For some, this message can be emotional. But if we really want Haiti to grow, we must recalibrate our thinking. We must diversify our actions. Besides manufacturing, Haiti needs to develop trade in services. As the World Trade Organization notes, services \u201crepresent the fastest-growing sector of the global economy and account for two-thirds of global output, one-third of global employment and nearly 20 percent of global trade.\u201d So, how can Haiti, the proud first black republic, develop such services as cultural tourism, ecotourism and even education? The Haitian government needs to show that it\u2019s not a blocker but an enabler of possibilities.Patrick Kabanda Silver Spring, Md. When the police are out of lineRe \u201cWhy we\u2019re so mad at de Blasio\u201d (Opinion, Jan. 10) by Steve Osborne: Mayor De Blasio\u2019s reasonable remarks about the need for the New York police to equally respect all in the community have been met with a show of disrespect by the assembled police by turning their backs on him while he spoke. While all decried the killing of two police officers, this police action was not about that. New York City\u2019s largest police union said the mayor instead should have been encouraging parents to teach their children \u201cto comply with police officers, even if they feel it\u2019s unjust.\u201d That comment displays an authoritarian mind-set based on force that clashes with an egalitarian outlook based on justice. And it is an authoritarian mind-set not all that far from fascism.Richard Keller Wellington, New ZealandThe factors driving tuberculosisRe \u201cTackling a curable killer\u201d (Opinion, Jan. 6): As bleak a picture of tuberculosis as Patrick Adams painted, the reality is worse. He left out two factors that are now driving the global TB epidemic faster than we\u2019ve been able to respond.First, diabetes. Diabetes is skyrocketing globally, and we know that diabetes increases a person\u2019s risk of developing tuberculosis by two to three times. While mostly a challenge in Western industrialized countries today, by 2035 some 80 percent of diabetics will live in developing and emerging market countries \u2014 exactly where the tuberculosis germ is most prevalent.Second, tobacco. With smoking on the decline in many rich countries, tobacco companies are aggressively going after customers in poorer countries where tuberculosis is common. Smokers are not only more susceptible to tuberculosis; they\u2019re twice as likely to get tuberculosis again once they\u2019re cured the first time.Dr. Paula I. Fujiwara, ParisThe writer is the scientific director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.Time for Israel to withdrawRe \u201cStop giving the Palestinians a pass\u201d (Opinion, Jan. 6): I find it interesting that Dennis B. Ross seems to find fault with the claim that United Nations \u201cresolutions are typically about what Israel must do and what Palestinians should get.\u201d As the far superior power in this vastly asymmetric conflict, it is Israel that has been responsible for the breach of international law through its near five-decade-long campaign of colonization and denial of basic human rights to the Palestinian people of the occupied West Bank. It is therefore quite reasonable that any fair resolution in the international arena should focus overwhelmingly on Israel\u2019s responsibility to withdraw its military forces from land that has been internationally recognized as sovereign Palestinian territory.It is difficult to imagine precisely what Mr. Ross believes the Palestinians should \u201cgive,\u201d considering that as the weaker party and ultimately the victim of Israeli aggression, they hold essentially no tangible bargaining chips that can compete with Israel\u2019s stranglehold of Palestine. The responsibility of the international community is thus precisely that of forcing Israel to relinquish its territorial control of the West Bank to the Palestinian National Authority.Scott Ratner, JerusalemSri Lanka\u2019s history of toleranceRe \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s violent Buddhists\u201d (Opinion, Jan. 3): Rohini Mohan\u2019s article is a cavalier attempt to exaggerate certain recent aberrations in my country and to project them as the prevalent norm. This erroneous assessment seems ill-motivated and tendentious \u2014 with the intention of misinforming the international community.The Constitution of Sri Lanka gives to Buddhism the foremost place, in recognition that it is in Sri Lanka that the teachings of the Buddha and the Pali texts were retained and preserved for the world. This does not mean that other religions are not recognized in our country. The Constitution guarantees every person the freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom of worship, observance, practice or teaching.Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians have co-existed harmoniously in Sri Lanka for centuries. Any visitor to the country would witness Buddhist temples, Hindu kovils, churches and mosques located next to each other or in close proximity all over the island, where followers practice their faiths in peace and in harmony with one another.In very recent times, several unfortunate incidents that occurred in the country involving minuscule sections of some religious groups indicated that Sri Lanka is not immune to the communal tensions engendered by extremist elements elsewhere in the world. The harm this causes to society has been recognized by the government, which responded swiftly to resolve such situations and restore normalcy.Prasad Kariyawasam, WashingtonThe writer is the Sri Lankan ambassador to the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Growth Slows, China Pins Hopes on Consumer Spending", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As demand for exports slips and the real estate sector cools, China has been looking to consumers to help pick up the slack. But the country\u2019s slowing growth will complicate those plans.The economy increased by 7.3 percent in the last quarter of 2014 and 7.4 percent for the full year, the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. While many countries would welcome such growth, the rate fell short of the government\u2019s target of 7.5 percent for the year, a rarity for the highly managed economy.China has rarely experienced a sustained slowdown in its economy, which has expanded seemingly unabated for decades. The last time yearly growth dipped below 7.5 percent was in 1990, after the Tiananmen massacre prompted international sanctions.China\u2019s leaders have said they are comfortable with steadier, albeit slower, growth, calling this period a \u201cnew normal.\u201d As the economy downshifts, Beijing is trying to wean its dependence on credit-fueled investment and government spending and move instead to a consumer-driven growth model.\u201cWe will continue to increase household consumption and make sure that greater internal demand could serve as a new power to drive economic growth,\u201d Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech at a global economic forum in September.But consumers could retrench if unemployment rises and they lose confidence in the direction of the economy. The stability of the real estate market is also important because Chinese households have much of their wealth tied up in their homes. The recent volatility in the stock market, which has attracted many ordinary investors, may only further undermine confidence.\u201cIn a slowing economy, people start to worry about their jobs, and that kind of uncertainty will affect people\u2019s consumption,\u201d said Liu Li-Gang, a China economist at ANZ bank.So far, the signals are mixed.Consumer spending, which makes up for 36 percent of the gross domestic product, has been increasing at a decent pace. Retail sales growth, while slowing, rose 12 percent in 2014, with demand for highly coveted products like iPhones continuing to skyrocket.But many luxury goods, along with the entertainment and services sectors, have been feeling the effect of President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on corruption in China as fewer people buy expensive gifts for officials.More recently, some big mass-market companies have started to show pockets of weakness. The beer maker SABMiller said sales in China had slowed, while they recently fell at the computer maker Lenovo. Unilever blamed the \u201csharp market slowdown\u201d for its recent quarterly slump in the country.\u201cHouseholds themselves realize the economy is going through a soft patch, and that will certainly have an impact on their appetite,\u201d said Kelvin Lau, economist at the Standard Chartered Bank. \u201cThat is why we are seeing some slowdown in retail consumption.\u201dWhether this amounts to a short-term blip or a long-term problem will depend, in part, on China\u2019s ability to push through reforms that encourage consumption and strengthen household income. Consumers like Chen Lu are a critical piece of that economic puzzle.After graduating from college, she spent most of her salary on rent. Today, Ms. Chen, 31, is earning more, working as a senior account manager for the listings magazine That\u2019s Beijing. She has plenty of extra pocket money for shopping, travel and going out to eat.\u201cWe will never be like my parents\u2019 generation who saved every penny and never spent any,\u201d Ms. Chen said. \u201cWe will never go back to that anymore.\u201dBut Ms. Chen represents a sliver of China\u2019s population. Getting more savers to become spenders will not be so easy.The average Chinese household saves as much as 40 percent of its income, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. In contrast, the household savings rate in the United States is 5.2 percent and is 1.8 percent in Japan, according to recent data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The main reason is that China just does not have the same safety net as other countries. Most Chinese have to save for retirement and health care because the country\u2019s social welfare system needs to be developed. The Chinese also save money for education.China\u2019s leaders have a variety of tools to increase consumption during periods of uncertainty.When Chinese exports plummeted after the financial crisis, the government introduced short-term programs to spur spending. Cities handed out coupons to local stores and restaurants. In rural areas, people were given rebates on big-ticket items like televisions, washing machines and refrigerators.This time around, the government is looking to longer-term policies to drive consumption. \u201cThe model of development has changed,\u201d Jiang Jianqing, the chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, said at the financial forum in Hong Kong, pointing to new government plans to revamp the financial and corporate sectors and improve the average Chinese person\u2019s livelihood.The government has focused on introducing a nationwide pension system, providing universal medical insurance and upgrading the education system. It has experimented with less burdensome tax requirements for businesses. Pilot programs have been introduced in Shanghai and in areas like the logistics sector. This would free up resources that could go toward better pay for employees.Bank reform is also on the table. State lenders have been given some leeway to pay depositors more on their savings, giving their money an extra boost and potentially encouraging consumption. Policy makers have pledged more liberalization of deposit rates. And Beijing has lifted restrictions for nonbank lending, paving the way for online retailers like JD.com, Guomei, Suning and Alibaba to begin offering consumer financing options. Still, it remains difficult for most Chinese to obtain a bank loan.While still relatively new, the concept of a minimum wage is also gaining traction, although the legal requirement varies by province. \u201cThey are still increasing minimum wage. That would continue to have this marginal boost to income of the low-skilled worker,\u201d said MK Tang, a China economist at Goldman Sachs.Beijing is also testing rural land reforms with pilot programs that allow Chinese farmers to lease land. Such initiatives, economists say, will create a wealth effect that increases rural household income.\u201cYou need something to kick-start consumption in order to make households wealthier, and the only way to make them wealthier is through reform,\u201d said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management.But to some economists and business leaders, such reforms are not happening fast enough.Liu Chuanzhi, the founder and chairman of Lenovo, is one of them. \u201cBesides what the government is saying, we want to see concrete policies and measures,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has so much potential in this respect.\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Kerry Meets With Nigerian Leaders to Encourage Peaceful Election", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Concerned that Nigeria could face postelection turmoil, Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday urged President Goodluck Jonathan and his principal political rival to respect the results of next month\u2019s presidential vote and to discourage their supporters from carrying out violent protests.\u201cIt is imperative that these elections happen on time, as scheduled, and that they are an improvement over past elections,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a news conference at the end of his visit here.Mr. Kerry said there was evidence that the militants from the Islamic State group, which has declared a caliphate in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq, were now making an effort to forge alliances with terrorist groups in Africa.\u201cIt is obviously a concern that they may try more aggressively to try to spread to countries in center and southern and other parts of Africa,\u201d said Mr. Kerry, who added that there was no indication as yet that Boko Haram has formally affiliated itself with the Islamic State.Mr. Kerry said that the United States was prepared to do more to help the Nigerian military\u2019s fight against Boko Haram, an Islamist group that does have links to Al Qaeda. But underscoring his larger point, Mr. Kerry warned that the level of American support would be influenced by the determination of Nigeria\u2019s politicians to carry out fair and peaceful elections.\u201cBottom line, we want to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our ability to do more will depend to some degree on the full measure of credibility, accountability, transparency and peacefulness of this election.\u201d\u201cThere has been a history of violence being fomented by political parties here in previous elections,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters before Mr. Kerry\u2019s meetings.\u201cWe hope that if there is any doubt about the election that they will use their court system and not encourage their supporters to go into the streets,\u201d said the official, who declined to be identified under the department\u2019s protocol for briefing reporters.The Nigerian public has become increasing alarmed by the army\u2019s inability to stop attacks and kidnappings by Boko Haram, which already controls much of the northern part of Nigeria.\u201cThere is increasing concern about the future of Nigeria\u2019s political stability as the conflict continues,\u201d noted a report by C.N.A. Corporations, a research organization based in the United States, which recently issued a report on the conflict with Boko Haram. \u201cThe inability of the military to beat back Boko Haram, combined with an increasing number of bombings in the south of the country and high-profile kidnappings, has eroded support for President Jonathan\u2019s administration (even within his traditional southern support base) and has begun.\u201dThe election on Feb. 14 is expected to be closely contested, and it is possible there could be at least one runoff, which would prolong uncertainty and potentially open the door to violent protests.Under election rules, a candidate must get at least 50 percent of the overall vote and 25 percent of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s states to win.If no candidate wins outright, a runoff will be held a week after the initial vote under the same rules. If there is still not a clear victor, a second runoff would be held seven days later, and the candidate who receives the majority of the votes nationwide would be declared the winner.An oil exporter, Nigeria has the biggest economy in Africa, but the decline in world oil prices has shaken its economic prospects.Complicating the voting is Boko Haram. The Independent National Electoral Commission has said that citizens who have been displaced by the fighting but still reside in the same state in which they are registered will be allowed to vote. But that will not help Nigerians who have fled the violence in the north.If political violence erupts, it could have sectarian overtones, because much of Mr. Buhari\u2019s support comes from the predominantly Muslim north, while Mr. Jonathan has support in the mainly Christian south.Encouraged by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, both candidates have issued statements opposing violence.\u201cThat said, there is a propensity for such violence to erupt, and we want to get ahead of it,\u201d said the State Department official.The American calculation seems to be that any push to expand the military campaign against Boko Haram will need to follow the election.How specifically the United States plans to help Nigeria regain the initiative against the group remains unclear. The abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in April provoked outrage in the United States and Europe. But a breakdown in trust between the United States and the Nigerian military has hampered cooperation against Boko Haram, as have fears that the provision of heavy weapons to Nigerian forces could lead to human rights abuses.Mr. Kerry said this month after meeting with Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, that the attacks by Boko Haram constituted war crimes, and he asserted that the United States was planning a \u201cspecial initiative\u201d to counter the group.But Mr. Kerry did not provided details of what that initiative was on Sunday.President Obama is planning to convene an international meeting on combating violent extremism on Feb. 18, and that could be an opportunity for discussing new ideas, the State Department official said.Mr. Jonathan became acting president in 2010 when his predecessor was ailing, and he won an election the next year. His party has governed Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999, but his election in 2011 dispensed with the tradition of rotating the presidency between the largely Christian south and the predominately Muslim north.Mr. Buhari became head of state in 1983 through a military coup but governed only until August 1985, when he was removed from power by another coup. During his term in office, he imposed austerity measures and restrictions on the press. But he is now presenting himself as the strongman Nigeria needs to confront Boko Haram.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Salman Ascends Throne to Become Saudi King", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBest known for overseeing the development of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, during his nearly 50 years as its governor, he became the country\u2019s defense minister in 2011 as a series of uprisings were shaking Arab leaders who had long been Saudi allies.The drop of world oil prices has hurt the country\u2019s economic base; the jihadists of the Islamic State have questioned its status as the global lodestar of Islam; and new civil strife is shredding Yemen, its southern neighbor.Analysts said that those challenges would most likely keep the new monarch from making any sudden changes to policy.\u201cThere will be a strong emphasis on continuity,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University. \u201cEspecially at a time when the price of oil is low and there is lots of turmoil in the region, the last thing they need is to get their people riled up.\u201dIt remained unclear how capable King Salman would be at putting in place Saudi responses to these difficulties. As crown prince, he was said to have taken over many of the duties of the head of state as Abdullah grew ill, but Salman\u2019s own health is in question. He is 79, has had at least one stroke and lost some movement in one of his arms.Robert Jordan, a former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said that Salman had a strong record as a good administrator, best demonstrated by his governorship of Riyadh.\u201cHe is considered to be a straight-shooter, not corrupt, well educated,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.His stances on social issues are less clear, but few think he will roll back the modest reforms put in place by his brother, which included encouraging women to enter the work force, a move criticized by some parts of the conservative clerical establishment.\u201cHe is very conservative, of course, like the rest of the kingdom, but I don\u2019t think he is likely to undo the reforms that King Abdullah initiated,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.In a statement attributed to the new king read on Saudi state television, he promoted Prince Muqrin bin Abdul-Aziz, who had been deputy crown prince, to crown prince, putting him next in line to the throne.Prince Muqrin, relatively young for a Saudi leader at 69, is a former air force pilot who also served as governor of Madina Province before being named the head of Saudi intelligence, a post he held until 2012. Like Salman, Abdullah and the kingdom\u2019s previous four monarchs, Muqrin is a son of King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the modern Saudi state.Jean-Francois Seznec, who teaches political economy of the Gulf at Georgetown University, said that the transition would probably not affect Saudi oil policy and the kingdom\u2019s strategy of keeping production up despite falling prices in order to hang on to market share.\u201cI think for the time being that they will be careful not to change very much and to go for stability,\u201d he said.But dealing with the crisis in Yemen, which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia and harbors Qaeda militants who are hostile to the monarchy, will probably be Salman\u2019s first task.\u201cI think it scares the hell out of the Saudis,\u201d Mr. Seznec said. \u201cIt is a dangerous place for them, and their Yemeni policy has been a huge failure.\u201dSalman\u2019s sons, too, hold a number of powerful positions: Prince Abdulaziz is the deputy oil minister; Prince Faisal is the governor of Madina Province; and Prince Sultan heads the tourism authority and was also an astronaut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Oil Prices Provide Benefits to U.S. Workers", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt may not have a huge effect on the top 10 percent of households, but if you\u2019re earning $30,000 or $40,000 a year and drive to work, this is a big deal,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. \u201cConceptually, this is the opposite of the stock market boom, which was concentrated at the top.\u201dIn recent years, most of the other positive economic trends \u2014 things like efficiency gains driven by new technologies, higher corporate profits, rising home prices, lower borrowing rates and stronger demand for white-collar workers with advanced degrees \u2014 have also mostly benefited businesses and wealthier Americans.But the latest drop in energy prices \u2014 regular gas in New England now averages $2.35 a gallon, compared with $2.94 in early December, and it is even cheaper in the Midwest at $1.95 \u2014 is disproportionately helping lower-income groups, since fuel costs eat up a larger share of their more limited earnings.For many residents of the bone-chilling state of Maine, the plunge in energy prices adds up to more than just a few extra dollars in their pockets and purses at the end of the month.Take April Smith, a home health aide, and her husband, Eddie, who works in the auto services department of the Walmart in Brunswick, Me. Together they bring in about $42,000 a year. For them, the decline in energy prices means being able to put meatloaf on the table instead of serving their four children hot dogs, ramen noodles and macaroni and cheese.\u201cOil prices, gas prices, food prices \u2014 luckily it\u2019s going down, which is great,\u201d Ms. Smith said, explaining that when prices were higher she had to scale back on groceries to save money for heating oil. \u201cI hope it keeps going.\u201dFor the overall economy, the tailwind generated by falling crude prices is expected to be particularly welcome as growth appears to be slackening overseas. Oil finished Friday at just under $49 a barrel, down from $65 early last month.What might be called an energy shock in reverse is creating losers as well as winners.States like Texas and North Dakota, which boomed as oil prices mostly stayed above $90 a barrel from 2011 to mid-2014, are now feeling a chill. So are industries that supply pipes and other material to energy drillers and frackers, including steel makers and sand producers.Nevertheless, economists say the benefits of lower energy prices will be felt much more broadly than the expected drag on some industries and regions.Household consumer spending contributes roughly 65 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 1 percent from oil and gas industry investment, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.In addition, consumers typically spend the money they save on fuel in sectors that are more \u201cemployment-heavy\u201d than the energy industry, Mr. Gapen said, like dining, travel and retail. He noted that stores employ about 13 percent of American workers, compared with the less than 1 percent of Americans who work in oil and gas extraction and related fields.Few places are more sensitive to shifts in oil prices than Maine, especially in winter. The state is dotted with struggling blue-collar towns like this one, where the economy is still reeling from the hangover from the recession, which only added to the woes created by sky-high energy prices and disappearing factory jobs.People here spend a significant proportion of their incomes on heating and transportation fuel, said Patrick C. Woodcock, who directs the governor\u2019s energy office. He estimates the typical family will save $3,000 this year if the cost of oil remains low.\u201cFor people who have been struggling with the economy, the winter has been the hardest time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time that there has been this space where you can make it through the winter in a more affordable way.\u201dHigh crude prices pose a particular threat here because almost two-thirds of Maine homes, which tend to be older and less efficient, rely on oil for heat. Officials have been urging residents to upgrade equipment and better insulate their houses, but the federal government gives the state only $1 million to promote insulation, Mr. Woodcock said, compared with $35 million to $40 million annually on fuel assistance. With oil prices down, at least for now, the aid that agencies dole out either as part of the federal low-income home energy assistance program, Liheap, or other efforts, goes much further. Suppliers can impose hefty fees to deliver small volumes of fuel, and last winter\u2019s emergency grants often fell short of the minimum needed to avoid these charges.\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve been able to get people a full 100 gallons,\u201d said Linda Dudley, assistant manager of the heat program at Waldo Community Action Partners in Belfast, on the coast.And for a vast portion of the country\u2019s population, such aid makes a huge difference. Households that earn $40,000 or less represent about 40 percent of American families, according to the Census Bureau.Even middle-class families who earn much more will see clear benefits, especially compared with wealthier Americans, who spend a much smaller share of their income on fuel. For example, Census Bureau data shows that households with annual earnings of less than $70,000 spent 5.9 percent of their income on gasoline in 2013 versus 3.4 percent in households where income tops $150,000.At the opposite end of the wealth spectrum, especially in states like this one, people are still grappling with difficult financial choices, despite the seeming windfall from lower energy costs.For Ms. Smith, the lower oil and gas prices mean she is talking with her husband about possibly quitting the second job she took on after they fell behind on bills last winter, despite the heating assistance they received through Community Concepts, which helps low-income residents in western Maine.She works 60 to 80 hours a week and worries that she is not spending enough time with the couple\u2019s four children, including a grandchild they are raising. First, though, Ms. Smith said she would like to catch up on current bills and \u201cmaybe get a little bit of money put away just in case things decide to go south.\u201dMs. Smith\u2019s fear, echoed by other still-cautious residents here, is that prices will turn back up, squeezing household budgets again.\u201cUs small people, we just see it go up and down, up and down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe throw a party when it\u2019s down \u2014 but not too much of a party because we know it\u2019s going up.\u201dDiane Cardwell reported from Lewiston, Me., and Nelson D. Schwartz from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Will Move to Protect Vast Arctic Habitat in Alaska ", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will ask Congress to increase environmental protections for millions of acres of pristine animal habitat in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, in a move that has already led to fierce opposition from the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers.If the proposal is enacted, the area would be the largest wilderness designation since Congress passed the Wilderness Act over 50 years ago. But the proposal seems unlikely to find support in Congress.\u201cDesignating vast areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness reflects the significance this landscape holds for America and its wildlife,\u201d Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement. \u201cJust like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our nation\u2019s crown jewels, and we have an obligation to preserve this spectacular place for generations to come.\u201dThe Arctic refuge is home to a vast and diverse array of wildlife, including caribou, polar bears, gray wolves and musk oxen. But it is also believed to hold significant oil and gas reserves. Ever since President Jimmy Carter signed a 1980 law creating the refuge, Alaska lawmakers have fought to open the area for drilling and development.Among the fiercest Republican opponents of the plan is Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.\u201cWhat\u2019s coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said.\u201cIt\u2019s clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory,\u201d she added. \u201cThe promises made to us at statehood, and since then, mean absolutely nothing to them. I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska. But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal.\u201dEnvironmentalists cheered the proposal, even though enactment appears unlikely.\u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters.\u201cBig oil has long wanted to get its hands on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,\u201d he said, adding that Fish and Wildlife Service scientists have said that the area \u201cis just too special to drill in.

{"Headline": "The Depression\u2019s Unheeded Lessons ", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewNow one of the world\u2019s leading economic historians, Barry Eichengreen, has come forth with an alternate view: Rather than hoist anyone to our shoulders for preventing another Depression, we should be more cleareyed about the ways in which global leaders did not really learn the lessons of the 1930s at all and made many of the same mistakes as their Depression-era counterparts.The reason the global economy is still in rough shape seven years later, in this telling, is that leaders in the United States and Europe drew the conclusions they wanted to hear from the Depression.\u201cOnce we averted a Great Depression, we succumbed to the instinct to do less in order to sustain economic growth,\u201d Mr. Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that we successfully averted a depression enabled policy makers to declare that we were ready to go back to normal policies before that was the reality.\u201dWhen the crisis first arose, policy makers of all political stripes could agree that fiscal stimulus would help the economy weather the rough times. In early 2008, the idea that fiscal stimulus could help encourage economic growth was uncontroversial enough that President George W. Bush and overwhelming majorities of a Democratic Congress agreed to a $152 billion package. By 2009, the idea had become politically polarizing. President Obama\u2019s much larger stimulus passed, but with hardly any Republican votes. And by 2011, even many Democrats accepted that it would be a year of pivoting toward deficit reduction. With the economy still ailing despite hundreds of billions spent, \u201cstimulus\u201d had become a dirty word.Why did public opinion turn so decisively, and quickly, against a stimulus strategy that had been considered uncontroversial to generations of economic policy makers?\u201cPoliticians are prone to overpromising,\u201d Mr. Eichengreen said, and policy makers did not grasp how bad things were or how high joblessness would rise in spite of stimulus spending. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand in real time how fast the economy was contracting in 2009. We overpromised in terms of what would be achieved in terms of the unemployment rate, not knowing the extent of the rise in unemployment that was already baked in.\u201dIn monetary policy, Mr. Eichengreen finds plenty to fault as well.In the three years following the most intense phase of the crisis, the Federal Reserve responded to the disappointing recovery with a series of half measures. \u201cQ.E. 2,\u201d the second round of quantitative easing, drew public attack far out of proportion with its ability to bolster growth. Anyone remember Operation Twist? It was also known as the maturity extension program, a gimmicky effort by the Fed to stimulate the economy by trading short-term bonds for long-term ones. It was the Fed\u2019s main stimulus program in 2011.It was not until September 2012 that the Fed unveiled a program that finally seemed to help jolt the United States economy to life, with its open-ended pledge to keep buying bonds using newly printed money until the outlook for jobs improved substantially.Public pressure on the Fed was, to a startling degree, one-sided. Many conservatives and financial market commentators assailed the central bank for its easy money stance, and there was little in the way of a crusade from the left to try to encourage greater activism by the Fed.In judging the individual actions of policy makers, Mr. Eichengreen is reluctant to place personal blame, acknowledging that decisions that seem crystal-clear in hindsight are considerably harder to make given imperfect information and fast-moving events. Seeing the challenges that officials confronted in responding to the unfolding crisis has even made him rethink some his views of the failures of the 1920s and \u201930s.\u201cIt makes me much more sympathetic than I was before, in understanding the uncertainty that George Harrison faced or Herbert Hoover faced,\u201d he said, referring to the chief of the New York Fed and the president at the onset of the Great Depression. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t know how quickly the economy was contracting in 1929, and the same was true at the end of 2008.\u201dBut there is a broader lesson here about the challenges of applying the lessons of history to modern policy, whether in economics or any other field. Even when faced with a close historical analogue and high officials with deep historical knowledge, our leaders came up short.The clich\u00e9d quotation from George Santayana, \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\u201d might have a coda: So, sometimes, are those who remember it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Portugal, a Land Finely Aged Like Wine", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong a vacation destination for travelers on the lookout for European pleasures at typically Portuguese budget prices, the Alentejo is rapidly becoming one of the top wine destinations in the world.The surprising thing about touching down at Lisbon Airport is how fast, heading south in a car, you find yourself transported into deep countryside. I arrived on a mild October morning, was met there by my old friend Martin Earl, and within a few minutes was crossing the Vasco da Gama Bridge, longest in Europe, an affair of towers and cables that stretches like a single bolt of flung steel across more than 10 miles of the Tagus River estuary. Immediately thereafter we swerved off the highway and decelerated into the dreaming, older world of the Alentejo (the word literally means \u201cbeyond the Tejo\u201d or Tagus).For the next five days we\u2019d travel among medieval whitewashed villages, rolling hills, mountain forts and a constellation of sparklingly modern vineyards. Long a vacation destination for travelers on the lookout for European pleasures at typically Portuguese budget prices, the Alentejo is finally taking its bow on the international stage, and is rapidly becoming one of the top wine destinations in the world.This fact would have both positive and negative consequences, as I\u2019d come to discover. In the meantime, I was there to sample the landscapes and hospitality with my friend Martin, who would also be my guide. By way of background I should explain that Martin and I were part of a group of five guys who\u2019d all met in college, been star-struck by the dream of literature and had remained adream ever since \u2014 even while somehow, inexplicably, becoming middle-aged along the way. But differently from the rest of us, Martin, a poet, had \u201cgone native,\u201d settling down with a local Portuguese girl and crossing over into a life lived entirely \u2014 and permanently \u2014 in another language.By now, 40 minutes from the airport, we were passing through sun-dappled alleys of plane trees with, beyond them, irregular row upon row of cork oaks. \u201cI sometimes call this area Corktugal to myself,\u201d Martin said with a dry laugh. The beautiful cork oak somewhat resembles a stouter, leafier olive tree, and is hand-harvested of its bark once every 10 years. The forests themselves are both a giant cash cow for the national economy \u2014 60 percent of the global cork trade originates in Portugal \u2014 and one of the most concentrated examples of biodiversity on earth.Meanwhile, the whitewashed villages kept coming, one after the other. We stopped for a coffee in a particularly sleepy, sun-blasted one called Montemor-o-Novo. Amid the mostly deserted low buildings there seemed to be a single cafe. But was it a cafe? The sign above it read, Grupo de Pesca Desportiva \u00e0 Linha de Montemor-o-Novo. This was a local hand-line fishing club, Martin explained, devoted to the old, pure form of the sport in which the line is held in the hands, dropped to the bottom and jiggled in emulation of live bait. These clubs are usually members-only, but the cheerful potbellied locals seated outside immediately waved us in.An excited barista explained that they were about to celebrate something extraordinary. The traditional Cante Alentejano, a polyphonic singing unique to the region, had just been designated by Unesco to be listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Better yet, one of the singers was right there and about to be feted.We watched as a waiter presented the singer \u2014 a middle-aged man distinguishable from the other patrons only by his dyed blond hair \u2014 with a tray bearing a white cube, roughly the size of a small brick. When I asked what this was, one of the old boys, to the merriment of the others, grunted at me like a pig.\u201cLard,\u201d Martin said simply. I had lived in Italy for years and in Rome had often seen ribbons of the stuff draped on plates and consumed like a kind of bacon sushi, but this was a block of pure porky fat, unadorned, and I watched amazed as the singer tucked a napkin into his collar and began hacking off pieces and then forking them into his mouth with a great smacking of the lips.We drank some of the deliciously bitter coffee, and continued on our way. The route lay southeast, in the direction of Spain, and we took secondary roads there the better to savor our surroundings. With the windows open, the little car buzzed like a blender. Roadside eucalyptus trees sent a delicious tang through the air.Martin and I caught up \u2014 the phrase, of course, means something entirely different in the era of connectivity \u2014 while the tilled brown fields rose and fell out the windows and occasionally a concrete bus shelter flashed by, edged with the characteristic blue or burnt-sienna trim that provides a charming bit of bright color in the landscape. Often we were stuck behind contraptions that resembled riding lawnmowers fitted with rudimentary car bodies. These slow, sputtering vehicles are known as \u201cmata-velhos\u201d \u2014 the word means \u201cold person killers\u201d \u2014 because their tiny 50-cubic-centimeter engines don\u2019t require a driver\u2019s license to operate and because they are often driven \u2014 and crashed \u2014 by the elderly.\u201cDo you ever forget?\u201d I asked him.\u201cForget what?\u201d he said.\u201cThat you\u2019re an American?\u201dHe gave a hesitant smile as we slewed \u00adsideways in one of the seemingly endless traffic circles that dot the countryside. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, but for the longest time all I wanted to do was pass as a local. I worked on the accent and studied the clothes. That all falls away over the years. Now I couldn\u2019t care less. Yet in a way I think of America more now than I ever have before. I appreciate it and revile it at the same time. Crazy, no? You hungry?\u201dWe turned off for lunch in a smallish town called Redondo. A local woman, when asked directions to a good restaurant, first pointed agreeably up the road and then without changing expression began screaming, according to Martin, that we were international drug smugglers and should be shot. \u201cIgnore her,\u201d he said immediately, \u201cand don\u2019t make eye contact. She\u2019s the village crazy.\u201d The woman\u2019s screaming lessened in volume as she turned away and entered her building and returned when she leaned out the second-story window still screaming and ordered us, apparently, to admire her cat.We found a promising-looking place called Porf\u00edrio's, with Mediterranean tavern d\u00e9cor of whitewashed walls and beamed ceilings. A tray of the tasty pay-as-you-go appetizers or entradas typical in Portugal was soon placed on our table: herbed and vinegared olives, breads, sausages and two kinds of fresh cheese. The lunch itself opened with an exquisite dogfish soup \u2014 the dogfish is a kind of shark, white-fleshed and sweet \u2014 followed by a first course of something called arroz de \u00adpato, or duck rice. A staple of the Portuguese menu, this dish characteristically distills the simplicity of its ingredients into something that explodes on the tongue like a bomb.Portuguese cooking works through a process of concentration of essential tastes bolstered by fresh ingredients rather than as, in more wealthy cultures, a multiple layering of flavor profiles. Arroz de pato is a classic example of this magnification-through-reduction. The lid of baked egg atop the rice was dotted with broiled bits of incredibly savory bacon and chouri\u00e7o, a sausage similar to chorizo, both of them sourced from local pigs. Plunging your fork through the lid released a jet of flavorful steam, and below the rice, a vein of moist, darkly delicious duck.But a last word about that pig. The animal reigns at the top of the food chain on Alentejo menus, consumed in all its parts down to nearly its eyelashes. The local specialty is porco preto, or black pig, a member of the swine family fed mostly on the acorns that fall from cork trees and presented in sausage, bacon and chops and as an enriching agent in a variety of stews. The animal\u2019s intense depth of flavor is due partly to that acorn-heavy diet, and as a bonus, those acorns imbue the flesh with oleic acid, the same heart-friendly ingredient found in olive oil.The next two days would take on an easy natural rhythm of eating, sightseeing and drinking the cheap, wonderfully well-structured local wines. We stayed in the beautiful mountain towns Monsaraz and Marv\u00e3o. Each of them was originally built as a fortified redoubt against invasion from nearby Spain and was visible from the valleys below looking like a kind of terra-cotta headpiece set high in the hills. Each was entered through several miles of switchbacks, and inside the thickly fortified walls, each had a similar array of aerobically steep cobbled streets, a castle, a small museum, shops, restaurants and panoramic views.In the smaller Monsaraz, we stayed at the immaculate Casa Pinto, a three-star hotel whose rooms were all furnished with different reminders of the once-mighty Portuguese colonial empire. My room was called Mombasa and boasted beautiful Moorish-cum-African d\u00e9cor, with wreathing ibex horns, dark-wood ceilings and a lovely, mood-lit stone grotto bathroom.But it was in the surrounding city, alas, that I first felt the weight of the tourist trade wearing away some of the indigenous sparkle. To put it plainly, the restaurants in these showcase mountain towns tended toward the tired, and the little ateliers and stores that honeycombed the alleyways seemed filled mainly with kitsch.The service staff I met there were perfectly polite but gave the impression \u2014 understandably, perhaps \u2014 of having grown a bit battle-weary from the waves of arriving foreigners. This was particularly striking because Alentejans have a reputation in their own country for warmth and sociability. (As for tourist fatigue, I would hear a similar sentiment from Lisbon friends at the very end of the trip. Their city, which had historically been a bit of a windbreak from the tourist cyclones blowing through the rest of Europe, was now overrun, they said, and about to suffer the same fate as Prague.)But it would be at lunch the next day that Portugal would finally offer up a truly world-class dining and drinking experience, one worth flying seven hours for and then driving a bunch more. It would take place at the Herdade dos Grous, a giant vineyard and estate in a village south of Beja, a town boasting a hotel whose services we didn\u2019t have time to sample and a restaurant whose services we did.In the high-ceilinged dining room, with views over the quilted green vineyards and a man-made lake, we ordered the chef\u2019s tasting menu accompanied by paired wines. The meal opened with a luxe version of typical entradas, the flavor of each small meat, cheese and vegetable dish as particularized as the panes of a stained-glass window. A lighter-than-air dogfish soup was followed by a veal medallion set in two Nike swooshes of mustard sauce, served with fingerling potatoes, a topping of radish sprouts and roasted chickpeas.The paired wines of Herdade dos Grous, on which more in a moment, began with a clean, delicate palate-cleansing white and accompanied the meal along an arc of increasing depth and complexity that ended with the cymbal crash of a 2011 Grous Reserva red. The net effect of this was one of the great culinary transports of my life.Afterward, I had the good fortune to talk with Lu\u00eds Duarte, the man responsible for the extraordinary wines I\u2019d just drunk. Mr. Duarte, who consults widely throughout the Portuguese wine industry, is the only one of Portugal\u2019s vignerons to have been named the winemaker of the year twice and is probably the most recognized voice of Portuguese wine, both at home and abroad. At 48, he speaks heavily accented English at breakneck speed and possesses a face that, in conjunction with his gray hair, gives him a vague resemblance to the former \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d actor Peter Graves.\u201cI belong to the first class that studied \u00adwinemaking in school, professionally,\u201d he said. \u201cMy particular innovation was that instead of working in the Douro\u201d \u2014 Portugal\u2019s traditional wine region, farther north \u2014 \u201cI decided to head south to the unsung Alentejo. It was my good luck to get in on the ground floor of the worldwide growth of wine and ride that wave.\u201dWhen asked the difference between Portuguese wine and that of other nations, Mr. Duarte didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wines of Chile and Argentina are too sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think Spain, you think the tempranillo grape. Well, we don\u2019t use the same grapes everyone else does. We have 315 different grape varieties, many of them unique to us. We\u2019ve also taken many French grapes and adopted them for our own use.\u201dWith a wave of the hand, he indicated the glasses on our table, still filled with the remnants of his elegant, delicious vintages, including several (of his own label) that have regularly landed in the Wine Enthusiast magazine\u2019s Top 100, and said: \u201cYou want a velvety and well-balanced wine at a good price? Think Portugal.\u201dAfter lunch, elevated by the previous two hours of eating and drinking, we strolled a bit in the nearby vineyards. It was late afternoon, the sun low in the sky, and in the lengthening shadows, workers were still on the job industriously trimming the vines. The air was filled with nostalgic aromas of earth and mown grass, and as we walked, I found myself remembering my own near-exile in Italy, a place where I\u2019d spent a total of eight years. Different from the Alentejo, Italy is long accustomed to being a sightseeing shrine of sorts, and its tourist treasures, as extraordinary as they are, often have a kind of annealed feeling to them, as of having been visited so often that they\u2019ve been buffed smooth by the experience.But Portugal, and particularly the Alentejo, give an entirely different impression: that of a place \u2014 showcase mountain towns apart \u2014 still waking up to its own worldly importance, and as a result, still vivid and sparklingly fresh.We had, meanwhile, been walking in a large circle and were almost returned to the main building when we saw a dog, a golden retriever, amble out to greet us. The animal was immediately approached by a barnyard cat. Instead of fighting, the two touched noses. \u201cAround here,\u201d Martin said with a wry smile, \u201ceveryone\u2019s so happy that even interspecies enemies kiss and make up.\u201d We laughed and turned back toward the car. It had been five days in that peculiar suspension of real life known as the road trip, and it was time to go home.Several hours later, back in the airport in Lisbon, I hugged my old friend goodbye. I was relieved to have found him at peace in his adopted country. There\u2019s an essential melancholy in exile, a sadness from the severed connections to family, habit and what the poet Paul Celan called the \u201cfatal once-only\u201d of the mother tongue that can weigh on those who\u2019ve made the move.In Martin\u2019s case, these deficits were offset by a good marriage, his unswerving devotion to his art and a country whose ancient ways allowed him the kind of concentration that speeding New York would have almost certainly denied him. In the process, coincidentally, that country had offered me two things: a reassuring insight into the adaptability of human nature over time, and a tour of the hilly, magical Alentejo, and with it, some of the very best eating and drinking of my life.IF YOU GOWHAT TO DOWHERE TO STAYWHERE TO EATAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rick Perry Puts Off Talk of 2016 as Tenure Ends", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 On his last full day as the chief executive of Texas, Gov. Rick Perry sat in his nearly empty office here on Monday, coatless in blue shirt sleeves, as he talked about his record-breaking 14 years in office and said he would decide within five months whether to run for president again.\u201cI think most people think we\u2019re probably going to run, but we\u2019ll announce our intentions in May or June,\u201d Mr. Perry, 64, said. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried to be coy at all. I\u2019ve been very forthright with my intentions to do the preparatory work that\u2019s required, and we\u2019ve done that.\u201dDuring an interview in his second-floor office at the Texas Capitol, Mr. Perry gave hints of how he would use his tenure as governor on the campaign trail, defended his actions on a law allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates, and said he expected the state\u2019s economy to weather the sharp drop in oil prices.He suggested that he had few, if any, regrets, and said he was proud that the Texas Legislature never overrode one of his vetoes, even as he vetoed more bills than any other governor of Texas. He leaves office under criminal indictment on charges alleging abuse of power, a case that could play out during a presidential campaign. As Mr. Perry puts off his decision about 2016, the field of potential Republican presidential candidates has grown increasingly crowded with those with Texas ties, including Ted Cruz, the state\u2019s junior senator in Washington, and Jeb Bush, the brother of former President George W. Bush. \u201cNone of them were governor of Texas for 14 years,\u201d Mr. Perry said bluntly when asked how he expected to stand out among the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay a lot of attention to who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, the horse race thing. I did this once, and I know it\u2019s a long process.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Perry also stood by his support of a law, which Texas passed in 2001, that allowed undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates to attend public universities. Mr. Perry signed the bill, known as the Texas Dream Act, but conservative activists and Republican legislators have vowed to overturn it. The Texas Republican Party\u2019s official 2014 platform calls for repealing it.His defense of the measure during his failed campaign for the presidential nomination in 2012 cost him support among some Republican primary voters.\u201cI still support the concept of allowing those people to be contributors to our society rather than takers,\u201d he said.The sharp collapse in oil prices has caused one expert \u2014 Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase \u2014 to speculate that Texas was at risk of a regional recession. In the 1980s, a drop in oil prices helped cripple the state\u2019s economy. Mr. Perry said the Texas economy was not as reliant on the oil and gas industry as it was in the 1980s, but he expressed concern about the long-term impact of the drop in oil prices.\u201cMidland, Odessa, it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he said, referring to two oil-rich cities in West Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people losing their jobs out there. When you lose your job, that\u2019s a recession, man. Those folks, I\u2019m greatly concerned about. But the great story is that people\u2019s lives have been improved substantially in Texas over the last 14 years, and we\u2019ve had our ups and downs.\u201dHe also joked about Texas\u2019 rivalry with California, saying \u201cthere are three things that California can do that we can\u2019t do: views, weather and wine.\u201dMr. Perry cited a report that found that Texas beat California in 2012 in technology exports. And he recalled being in a Laguna Beach resort in Southern California, on a visit to lure businesses to Texas. \u201cI\u2019m making my pitch about Texas, about our tax, regulatory, legal system, our skilled work force,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd just about the time the sun is touching the horizon, the Pacific, I turn \u2014 it\u2019s glorious, it\u2019s magnificent \u2014 and I said that is Exhibit A of how a state could foul something up so bad that you would leave that.\u201dFew political leaders have embodied Texas exceptionalism as Mr. Perry has. He once declared in a speech that historians would look back on this century and call it \u201cthe Texas century.\u201d Mr. Perry suggested that he was not worried how voters in other states might perceive such comments and views should he make another run for president.\u201cI talk about a model and it can happen anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t, \u2018We\u2019re good, you\u2019re bad.\u2019 This is, \u2018How can we be good together?\u2019 That\u2019s my goal.\u201dThe governor also spoke of performing one of his last informal acts as governor: underlining a passage in the Bible for Greg Abbott, the former state attorney general who will be sworn in as governor on Tuesday. Departing governors have underlined passages for incoming leaders in a tradition that dates to January 1925, using a Bible that Mr. Perry had kept close at hand in a wooden drawer. On Monday, the open Bible \u2014 with lines of Scripture underlined by George W. Bush, John B. Connally Jr. and other former governors \u2014 was among the few items on his glass-topped desk.Mr. Perry said he selected the passage \u2014 Matthew 20:25-28 \u2014 because it meant, \u201cIf you really want to be great, you must first be a servant.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what this job is supposed to be about. It\u2019s not about power. It\u2019s about making a difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201dYet, he might be the last Texas governor to remain so long in office. Two Republican lawmakers are proposing a bill to limit future governors, and all other statewide elected officials, to two consecutive four-year terms. Asked if three four-year terms were too long, Mr. Perry said any such decision was up to Texas voters.\u201cI applied for the job every four years,\u201d he said.

Why would we trust the aggregated (but never publicly tallied) opinions of 6,000 or so film-business professionals over the exquisitely argued verdicts of critics or the hard data of the box office? Here then are some of our thoughts on the current Oscar season, its stakes, follies and meaning or lack thereof.But the point isn\u2019t really to select the best movies and performances of the year. The point is to put the American movie industry on glorious, ridiculous display, to provide an annual window into the psychology, sociology and political economy of Hollywood.So on that high-minded note: What happened to \u201cGone Girl,\u201d a major studio release (from 20th Century Fox) that got mostly good reviews, sold a lot of tickets and inspired endless post-spoiler think pieces? And what about \u201cInterstellar,\u201d a Paramount release, which survived a cycle of hype and backlash to bring in more than half a billion dollars worldwide?\u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d \u201cBirdman\u201d and \u201cSelma\u201d all seem to be in better shape. So does \u201cBoyhood,\u201d a 12-year labor of love incubated far from Hollywood and released by a company (IFC Films) that has never been much of an Oscar player. Do we think it has a chance in the major categories? What would a \u201cBoyhood\u201d win mean?Other than that, film critics like us, who proclaimed our love for that movie early and ardently, might not be able to complain about the Oscars for a while.Every best-picture winner holds a mirror up to the Academy in some fashion, reflecting a narrative about the industry that the voters can embrace, whether it\u2019s the liberal pieties of \u201cCrash\u201d or the triumphant union of art and technological change in \u201cThe Artist.\u201d Fox Searchlight, which distributed \u201c12 Years,\u201d apparently understood how its movie was speaking (or could speak) to voters. That\u2019s why, I\u2019m guessing, it ran ads that read \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d during the Oscar race, as in, it\u2019s time for this sorry group of white people \u2014 for the first time in its long sorry history \u2014 to give its most public honor to this film or rather its monumental subject. I thought the ads were so outrageously obvious that they would hurt the movie, but I forgot that there\u2019s no such thing as over-obvious when it comes to the Oscars.Hollywood likes a narrative that affirms its progressive values and political virtues: the story that ends happily with wins for \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d or \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d Another popular story is about how the Academy rewards popular success. (\u201cGladiator\u201d and \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d are in this category.) There is also the story line \u2014 popular in recent years \u2014 that celebrates what might be called auto-cinephilia, or movie self-love. Three of the last five best picture winners were about showmanship: two of them (\u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cArgo\u201d) specifically about movies and the other (\u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d) about a different kind of performer overcoming obstacles. This year, \u201cSelma\u201d seems to fit into the first category, \u201cGone Girl\u201d into the second and \u201cBirdman\u201d into the third.Is this too tidy? Too cynical? The thing about the Oscars that drives journalists crazy is the way they, like \u201cHollywood\u201d itself (as a mythical construct and an economic and creative entity), make it hard to distinguish idealism from cynicism.Whether the missives were cynical or bottom-line driven, these nods to Hollywood history suggest that the industry hasn\u2019t entirely succumbed to spreadsheet logic. The Oscars suggest the same because, while the awards are gold-plated onanism writ large and overly long, their very existence proves that the people who make movies have a sense of history, even if that only extends to their own legacies. It\u2019s a banal truth that the industry is a crude, mercenary business, one that\u2019s currently bingeing on superhero movies. Yet despite overwhelming evidence, it remains a human enterprise. The fact that it makes room for directors as different as Mr. Fincher, Ava DuVernay and Paul Thomas Anderson indicates that industry folks want to be remembered for more than being Mr. Sandler\u2019s enablers.The \u201cInterview\u201d business, nonetheless, feels like something new under the sun. The hack itself is a reminder of the radical insecurity of digital information, just as the simultaneous release of the film online and in independent theaters may be a harbinger of things to come. We have grown accustomed to the idea that entertainment will be available to us when we want it, on our phones or tablets or whatever. At the same time, we assume, na\u00efvely, that our information is safe and that large corporations are super-vigilant when it comes to protecting their digital property. If Sony is so vulnerable, what about the rest of us?\u201cCitizenfour,\u201d Laura Poitras\u2019s scary documentary about Edward Snowden, provides an obvious, chilling answer. The rights to privacy and freedom of expression are invoked in that film, as they have been in the wake of the Sony hack, but the Snowden and the Sony revelations show just how complicated those ideas have become in the 21st century. A foreign government can hijack corporate data. Our own government can do the same with personal data. And more and more of the communication we think of as \u201cours\u201d \u2014 our Tweets and Facebook posts, our Google searches and on-demand video selections \u2014 takes place neither in privacy nor in the constitutionally protected public sphere, but in corporate-owned-and-operated space.I used to worry about being paranoid. Now I worry about not being paranoid enough.Seriously, though: Am I wrong to detect an anti-technological theme in the air? The Oscar contenders set in the present bend away from innovation: \u201cGone Girl\u201d is about two writers brought down by the death of print; \u201cWild\u201d is about the authenticity of living off the grid; \u201cBirdman\u201d uses Raymond Carver and Broadway theater as weapons of resistance against the tyranny of the digitally enhanced blockbuster.And there are so many period films. I recently went back to see \u201cSelma\u201d again and found myself fixated on the rotary-dial phones, boxy tape recorders and especially the radio console set into the kitchen wall of Dr. and Mrs. King\u2019s home. And how about the marvelous whir and clatter of Christopher the computer in \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d? Or the old-school detective work of Doc Sportello in \u201cInherent Vice,\u201d undertaken without a smartphone or a search engine? Even the futurism of \u201cInterstellar\u201d was tinged with nostalgia (and the picture itself was shot on film). Maybe one of the functions of movies, even as they inevitably embrace technological progress, is to keep some sense of the old ways alive, making Hollywood a kind of cultural Jurassic World.Should we be worried about American commercial cinema? Yes, no, maybe. What I do know is that many of us tend to talk about the movie industry as if it were a stand-alone entity, but Time Warner, for instance, owns both Warner Bros. and HBO. While some of Time Warner\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d still hits theaters first \u2014 including its mega-blockbusters, its franchises and an occasional miracle like Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u201cInherent Vice\u201d \u2014 some of its product is designated for small screens. Put another way, Warner Bros. no longer has the art-house boutique Warner Independent Pictures (which released titles like \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d), but its parent company has HBO. So, have serious mainstream motion pictures disappeared, or have they been reconfigured, serialized and rerouted to smaller screens?One other thing that seems clear is that not enough mainstream movies this year stirred up the kind of excitement that the HBO show \u201cTrue Detective\u201d did, as the current lineup of largely blah Oscar contenders suggests. The commercial movies that do excite audiences tend to be franchises that, when they connect with their audiences \u2014 as \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d have \u2014 affirm that movies remain popular and populist. Again, should we be worried or should we acknowledge that the visual mediums now flow together so seamlessly into a single image stream that one day the Academy Awards may, like the Golden Globes, dole out prizes for small-screen achievements? Because, really \u2014 the best actress Oscar should go to Ms. McDormand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Job Growth Fails to Help Paychecks of Workers", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation\u2019s economy is entering 2015 in its best shape since the recession, but the improving job market has so far failed to help most Americans earn significantly more at work. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added another 252,000 workers to their payrolls in December, capping a year in which total employment rose by 2.95 million, the largest advance since 1999.The unemployment rate also improved, edging down last month to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in November. The rate plunged just over a full percentage point between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline since 1984.But a drop in average hourly earnings last month, after a healthy gain in November, sidetracked hopes that a tighter labor market was beginning to lead to broader wage gains.\u201cThe rising tide of this economic wind at our back has to lift more boats,\u201d Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez said in a telephone interview. The nation\u2019s wage situation, he said, is a crucial part of the \u201cunfinished business\u201d of the nation\u2019s economic recovery, which began around the middle of 2009.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the decline in wages came despite December gains in construction and health care jobs and other jobs that typically offered good salaries.\u201cThis is still a buyer\u2019s market in terms of labor,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all the good news on unemployment and the number of jobs we\u2019ve created, if these wage numbers are to be believed, employers still have their pick.\u201dFor the Federal Reserve, the mixed message from the jobs reports makes the timing of its first interest rate increase in years more problematic. Robust job growth and the lowest unemployment rate since June 2008 suggest a rapidly improving economy, possibly persuading the Fed that it should move sooner rather than later to raise rates to lessen the risk of speculative bubbles or future inflation.\u201cIf the activity data continue to improve, as we expect,\u201d Paul Dales, a senior economist for Capital Economics, said in a note to clients, \u201cthen the Fed may not wait for wage growth to rise and could still raise rates as soon as March.\u201dYet as long as wages lag and ordinary Americans are not enjoying much of the fruits of an improving economy, the Fed should stand pat, many economists say.\u201cThe economy clearly has no wage or price pressures that would point towards an early liftoff on interest rates,\u201d Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post.William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he worried that the Fed would raise interest rates too soon, hurting small businesses that could hire more workers as long as they maintained ready access to low-interest loans.\u201cWe need a financial environment where that can take place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that gets interrupted, hiring is going to get choked off too early.\u201dStill, economic prospects are clearly improving. Even in the absence of better wage gains, declining oil prices may help bolster purchasing power. One economist likened the lower prices to the equivalent of a pay raise of about $1,000 a person for the year, if prices stay low.The drop in oil prices represents a substantial transfer of income from oil producers to oil consumers, said Kevin Logan, a chief economist for HSBC Bank. While some American oil producers are shutting unprofitable rigs and planning job cuts that could damage oil- and shale-producing regions like Louisiana and North Dakota, the overall economic effect for the nation is positive.Employers added 252,000 jobs in December as the labor market closed out a breakout year on a strong note, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate fell from 5.8% to 5.6%, lowest since June 2008. The rate plunged just over a full percentage point between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline since 1984.\u201cEvery dollar gained is a dollar lost, but the benefits are widespread and the losses are concentrated and will be small,\u201d Mr. Logan said.There are other encouraging signs that the recovery is on solid footing.\u201cAt the current pace of job growth, the economy should be closing in on a 5 percent unemployment rate by this time next year, which is consistent with full employment,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWage growth should also pick up more broadly in coming months.\u201dBetter, higher-paying jobs are already are being created. Business and professional services have been adding jobs in recent months, though last month many were in the lower-paying administrative category.Mr. Furman said the estimated 0.7 percent increase in real earnings in 2014 is a bit higher than the average annual increase of 0.5 percent from 2000 through 2007, the period of the last expansion. He calculated the figures using the Consumer Price Index inflationary measures through November, as well as consensus projections for December.\u201cBut there is more work to be done to raise wages and address longer-standing challenges around family incomes,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Overall job growth last year averaged 246,000 a month, after 194,000 a month in 2013.But more than eight million workers are still looking for full-time employment, while many others have reluctantly accepted part-time work. The share of men in their prime working years who are not working has more than tripled since the 1960s. Long-term unemployment remains highly elevated, and the work force participation rate, already at historically low levels, slipped in December.An interactive comparison of a day in the life of 147 men and 147 women without jobs.Eventually, better wages should draw more people to the working world, said the American Action Forum, which summed up Friday\u2019s economic data as, \u201cJob, No Money.\u201d\u201cA strong labor market attracts people to participate and pays them rising wages,\u201d the right-leaning policy group said in a release. \u201cIt is hard to say the labor market is strong despite the robust top-line numbers. The U.S. economy is healing, but not yet healthy.\u201dThe frustration over wages was evident despite the other positive indicators.\u201cThe good news is that in 2014, people were increasingly finding jobs,\u201d said Elise Gould, a senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute, in a statement. \u201cThe bad news is that we are still digging our way out of the recession, and wage growth remains stagnant and untouched by recovery.\u201dEven as the economic recovery advances toward its sixth anniversary with a strong tailwind, it faces several hurdles. The strong dollar \u2014 at its highest point in years \u2014 is hailed by many as a sign of America\u2019s improving economic conditions. But the dollar\u2019s strength comes with consequences. American manufacturers may lose their competitive edge as the stronger dollar makes their goods more expensive compared to those from other countries. Demand for American products could wane, and exports over all could suffer.Another potential threat for the United States is the overall weakness in the global economy. Europe\u2019s economy is stagnant, China\u2019s is slowing and Japan\u2019s is struggling to emerge from a recent downturn.\u201cThere\u2019s a risk we could see slower job growth if much of the world goes into recession,\u201d said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely, but there\u2019s a chance.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of comments by Federal Reserve officials. They noted the global economy\u2019s weakness in December, according to meeting minutes released this week; they did not meet this week. An earlier version also misspelled the surname of a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He is Jared Bernstein, not Berstein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bombardier\u2019s CSeries Gamble Is Facing Longer Odds", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere have been unspecified supplier problems, design changes and last winter\u2019s horrible weather. Then in May at an airport outside this city, one of the plane\u2019s innovative new engines exploded during a ground test, damaging a prototype.Now, many analysts expect that the first passengers won\u2019t step aboard a CSeries jet until 2016, although the company is standing by its forecast of late 2015.\u201cThey\u2019re in a street fight,\u201d Addison Schonland, a partner at AirInsight, a commercial aviation consulting firm.Bombardier\u2019s project has long passed the point of no return. Hundreds of planes have been ordered. Production is slowly rumbling up to speed. The company is on track to spend $4.4 billion to develop the plane.The bet on the CSeries won\u2019t break Bombardier, which has yearly revenues of about $18 billion. But it does make the company vulnerable. The delays have depressed Bombardier\u2019s share price. And because airlines pay for planes on delivery, any further delays could squeeze the company\u2019s credit.The payoff for Bombardier could be significant if the plane proves a serious competitor to the 737 and the Airbus A320, the European company\u2019s highest-volume airliner. Already the world\u2019s largest rail producer and a leader in commuter and business jets, Bombardier could become a major player in civil aviation if the CSeries succeeds.\u201cIt would be hard to predict where Bombardier is today if I went back to when I started,\u201d said Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier\u2019s president and chief executive, who in 1985 joined the company founded by his grandfather. \u201cInvestments like the CSeries give us that opportunity again to double the size of the company.\u201dBombardier has a history of transformation.That coincided with this city\u2019s glory years when it embarked on a variety of megaprojects. Laurent Beaudoin, the founder\u2019s son-in-law, father of Pierre and the company\u2019s chairman, reopened a shuttered Ski-Doo factory to build the cars for one of those plans: the city\u2019s new subway. He then aggressively landed a contract to supply New York with subway cars. The $1 billion deal was more than double the company\u2019s total revenue at the time.Laurent Beaudoin\u2019s biggest gamble came in 1986. Bombardier was the only bidder for Canadair, an ailing aircraft manufacturer that the Canadian government put up for sale. Pierre Beaudoin recalled that Bombardier was widely criticized as overreaching.\u201cI remember the cartoon in the paper: It was a flying Ski-Doo,\u201d Mr. Beaudoin said. \u201cWhat do these people know about aerospace?\u201dMr. Beaudoin sees the CSeries as a repeat of its regional jet story. That is, a plane for a market segment that, in conventional aviation wisdom, does not exist.Bombardier committed to the CSeries program in 2007 after an air travel study that it commissioned. The study showed, according to Mr. Beaudoin, a growing impatience among travelers to route through major hubs on the way to their final destination.Those hubs give airlines greater economies of scale. But Bombardier calculated that a new efficient airliner slightly smaller than a 737 or an A320 \u2014 one with 100 to 150 seats \u2014 could carry passengers directly between smaller airports at the same cost per seat as the larger planes.\u201cAirlines are forcing you through hubs because they\u2019re being forced to have big airplanes,\u201d Mr. Beaudoin said. \u201cThe only person that\u2019s not happy there is actually the traveling public.\u201dThe linchpin for the CSeries was a new concept for engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, known as a high bypass geared turbofan. The new engine design promised exceptional fuel savings of up to 20 percent and unusually low noise levels.A trip out to the 1.1 million-square-foot factory in Mirabel, Quebec, where the CSeries is being built, reveals that the plane is as much a technology gamble as a financial one. Inside the assembly hall, two towering robots join wings, nose and tail pieces made from lightweight carbon-fiber composites to traditional aluminum fuselage sections. Tucked in another part of the plant, a complete cockpit is connected to a room filled with computers. The CSeries is Bombardier\u2019s first \u201cfly by wire\u201d plane; the only connections between the cockpit\u2019s controls and the parts they command are electronic.As he walks briskly through the plant, Robert Dewar, a Bombardier vice president who is general manager for the CSeries project, acknowledged that the new technologies, particularly fly-by-wire, contributed to the delays. The engine\u2019s failure in May, he added, eventually proved to be caused by a relatively minor fault in an oiling system rather than a fundamental design flaw.Most analysts agree the plane, which will come in two models of different lengths ranging from 108 to 160 seats, represents an advance in airliner design. But that achievement, they add, is far from the end of the struggle.\u201cIt\u2019s a small company in Canada that has pulled off something that\u2019s very impressive,\u201d Mr. Schonland said. \u201cNow, tell me how you are going to sell it.\u201dNeither Boeing nor Airbus has ignored Bombardier\u2019s challenge. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus, has been particularly open about its plan to keep Bombardier out of the full-size airliner market.As Bombardier sorted through its problems, its two rivals introduced versions of their smallest planes equipped with similar engine technology. Embraer has also joined the field with a stretched out regional jet.Bombardier may find it difficult to carve out space, given the preference among many air carriers to stick with a single aircraft maker, according to Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aerospace and defense industry analysis firm. More important, he said, Boeing and Airbus have a significant cost advantage.But Mr. Beaudoin remains confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 orders before deliveries begin. The company currently has about 200 firm orders.Many of those buyers, he expects, will be new carriers drawn by the plane\u2019s ability to avoid hubs. The program\u2019s credibility has mainly come from an order for 30 planes from the German airline Lufthansa and one for 40 from Macquarie AirFinance. \u201cThe two big manufacturers have spent their time saying that we won\u2019t have an airplane, that the airplane won\u2019t fly,\u201d Mr. Beaudoin said, referring to Boeing and Airbus. \u201cYou can imagine now that the spotlight will be on the reliability of the airplane.\u201d\u201cBut, you know,\u201d Mr. Beaudoin added with a small laugh, \u201cI would be doing the same thing as they\u2019re doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit\u2019s Auto Show and U.S. Banks\u2019 Financial Reports", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Week Ahead\u2022 A Show of Optimism in Detroit The annual Detroit auto show kicks off on Monday with a full slate of media previews that reflect growing optimism and financial strength in the industry despite its recent safety travails.Sales in the United States surged to 16.5 million vehicles in 2014, and automakers are expecting even better results in the year ahead. To capitalize on the demand, companies are unveiling a raft of new models that expand traditional vehicle segments and fill untapped niches in the market.General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker, will be among the busiest manufacturers at the show. After stumbling through 2014 with a record number of safety recalls, G.M. is determined to shift attention back to products like the Buick Cascada convertible, a new version of its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid and an all-electric concept car that can travel 200 miles on a single battery charge.Other carmakers will be appealing to consumers who crave faster cars with a touch of glitz. For Ford Motor, the emphasis will be on high-performance variations of mass-market models such as the Focus sedan. Newly merged Fiat Chrysler will show off a two-seat Alfa Romeo sports car, while Honda debuts a much-anticipated revival of its sporty Acura NSX luxury car.At the other end of the spectrum are mainstream sport utility vehicles from Volkswagen and pickup trucks made by Toyota and Nissan. Industry analysts expect trucks and S.U.V.s to continue to gain share in 2015, particularly if gas prices remain at notably low levels.The Detroit show also highlights the executives who sit atop the automotive world and their prospects in the coming year. No one will be under greater scrutiny than Mark Fields, who last year replaced the retiring Alan Mulally as chief executive at Ford. At G.M., the spotlight will again shine on Mary T. Barra, the beleaguered chief executive who is anxious to move past the company\u2019s recent safety crisis. And the leader of Fiat Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne, will update his plans to integrate the Italian and American sides of the industry\u2019s newest global competitor.\u2022 Major U.S Banks to Report EarningsThe country\u2019s largest banks will all report their fourth-quarter and year-end financial results this week. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will kick off the earnings season on Wednesday, with Bank of America and Citigroup reporting on Thursday and Goldman releasing its results on Friday. The Wall Street trading operations that helped lift bank earnings in the third quarter are expected to deliver much weaker results in the fourth.\u2022 Results of E.U. Hearings on Trade Agreement With the U.S.Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union trade commissioner, is expected on Tuesday to present results of a public consultation on a hotly contested investment clause that has complicated trade negotiations with the United States. The clause, of a planned trans-Atlantic trade agreement, has sparked outrage among labor unions and environmental groups, which say it would give corporations too much power to override policies of sovereign governments.\u2022 December Sales Report for Retail and Food ServicesOn Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release its advance retail and food services sales figures for December, a closely watched barometer of the strength of the economic recovery. Analysts say that sales may have cooled in December from the previous month, when retail sales jumped 0.7 percent and food services 5.1 percent from the same period last year.\u2022 Opinion on Debt-Purchase Plan From a European JuristA senior adviser at Europe\u2019s highest appeals court is expected to issue a nonbinding opinion on Wednesday on a plan by the European Central Bank to buy bonds of stricken eurozone countries. The program, announced in 2012, has never been deployed but was widely credited with helping rescue the eurozone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Approves Keystone XL Pipeline Bill, Testing Obama", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Republicans won control of the Senate late last year, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chose the Keystone bill as the first measure Republicans would send to Mr. Obama.The White House promptly said that Mr. Obama would veto the measure, which would force the approval of a proposed 1,179-mile oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. It would be just the third veto of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, but the opening shot in a fight over Republican-sponsored measures.Either way, the bill is expected to reach the president\u2019s desk as soon as next week. It is unlikely, however, that either the Senate or House can muster the two-thirds majority of votes necessary to override a veto.Mr. Obama, who currently retains authority to approve or deny the permitting of the pipeline because it crosses an international border, is expected to veto the bill because it would remove his executive authority to make the final decision. Senate Republicans said that if he vetoed the Keystone bill, they would add it on to another measure this year, like must-pass spending legislation or a broader energy bill.But pressure is mounting on the president from both sides to make a final decision on Keystone construction, which has been pending since he took office.Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that he is waiting for all reviews and processes to be completed before he makes a final decision. In 2013, he said that his verdict on the pipeline would be based on whether its construction would worsen climate change. But an 11-volume State Department environmental review of the proposed pipeline, released last year, concluded that its construction would not significantly increase the rate of planet-warming pollution into the atmosphere.After that review was released, Mr. Obama said that he would not issue a decision until a court case in Nebraska over the pipeline\u2019s route was settled. Earlier this month, the Nebraska court cleared the way for the pipeline\u2019s construction through that state.Mr. Obama has also said that he wants to wait until a series of reviews by additional cabinet agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Defense, Interior, Homeland Security and Commerce, are complete.The deadline for those reviews, aimed at determining whether the project is in the national interest, is on Monday.People on both sides of the debate are urging Mr. Obama to make a decision soon, and some people say that after the years of deliberation and delay, he could weigh in as soon as February.Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican who is a chief sponsor of the bill, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got Congress approving it on a bipartisan basis. All six states on the route have approved it. The Nebraska court decision is done. The American people overwhelmingly support it. The president has to consider all that when he makes his decision.\u201dOn that point, environmentalist opponents of the pipeline agreed. \u201cThis issue is ready for a decision,\u201d said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the groups that has held hundreds of rallies outside the White House and around the country, urging Mr. Obama to reject the project. \u201cAfter the agencies have weighed in, this issue has been examined enough, and the president has everything he needs to make this decision.\u201dAfter all this time and deliberation, Mr. Brune expressed confidence that Mr. Obama would reject the pipeline.\u201cI bet your lunch he\u2019ll reject it,\u201d he said.Mr. Brune said his confidence stemmed from recent public statements Mr. Obama had made that disparaged the pipeline project. In a December interview on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d Mr. Obama said he would weigh the project\u2019s effect on climate change against its potential for the creation of jobs.\u201cWe have to examine that, and we have to weigh that against the amount of jobs that it\u2019s actually going to create, which aren\u2019t a lot,\u201d he said.Despite the debate over the pipeline, and its potency as a symbol of energy and environmental policy, experts have pointed out repeatedly that the symbolism vastly outweighs its substance.Still, the two-week Senate floor fight over the Keystone bill set the stage for debates on more substantial energy and climate change policy issues over the next year, and for the presidential election. Most notably, it forced Republicans into an on-the-record vote on their views on climate change: 15 Republicans voted in favor of a resolution declaring that humans contribute to climate change, and five Republicans voted in favor of a resolution declaring that humans contribute significantly to such change.The Senate also voted in favor of an energy-efficiency amendment from Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire. The amendment, which aims to reduce energy use in commercial buildings, would go down in Mr. Obama\u2019s veto, but the senators are expected to reintroduce it as a separate measure this year, which has a good chance of congressional and presidential approval.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the final totals of the Senate vote on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The final vote was 62 to 36, not 60 to 36.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Citizen Coke,\u2019 by Bartow J. Elmore", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHalfway into \u201cCitizen Coke,\u201d Bartow J. Elmore describes taking a treacherous journey through an Indian jungle in 2010. He was searching for a Coke bottling plant that had been shut down six years earlier after villagers claimed it had parched their wells and polluted their streams, causing skin and stomach diseases. Thirsty and tired, he stumbled upon a restaurant in a secluded village where the only safe thing to drink was . . . Coca-Cola. \u201cIt seemed I had become trapped in the history I had come to investigate,\u201d he writes.This vivid, suspenseful scene encapsulates the book\u2019s essential argument: That for all its attempts to brand itself as an engine of economic development and a philanthropic force, Coke\u2019s thirst for growth has turned it into a parasite on public health and the planet.Elmore, a history professor at the University of Alabama, has written \u201can environmental history of Coca-Cola capitalism, one that restores the connection between the Real Thing and the real ecologies that supported it.\u201d He investigates Coke\u2019s every ingredient and its real secret formula: \u201cStaying out of the business of making stuff. The company consistently proved adept at tapping into technological systems that were built, financed and managed by others. It maintained a slender organizational structure compared to other similarly profitable multinationals and kept off its books the costs and risks associated with natural resource extraction and ingredient production. It was the ultimate outsourcer, long before the term \u2018outsourcing\u2019 became popular.\u201d In Elmore\u2019s telling, Coke becomes \u201cthe Forrest Gump of the 20th-century economy, a native son of the American South that seemed to find his way into a dizzying array of global trading networks.\u201d Leaning heavily on outsourcing and taxpayer-\u00adfunded infrastructures the world over, Coke pioneered its own brand of capitalism, with the help of slick lobbyists and marketing gurus, and created one of the most profitable businesses in the world. In 2012, Coke sold more than 1.8 billion servings a day \u2014 one for every four people on earth.Coke was the brainchild of John Stith Pemberton, a broke, morphine-addicted pharmacist in Atlanta who advertised it as a \u201cbrain tonic.\u201d \u201cJust add a few squirts of carbonated water,\u201d he instructed the salesmen hawking the syrup in 1886. A century later, those squirts have gushed into a tidal wave. Over 79 billion gallons of water are required annually to dilute Coke syrup, and an additional eight trillion gallons are needed for other aspects of production, including the manufacturing of bottles. In 2012, Coke used more water than close to a quarter of the world\u2019s population.What Elmore does best is analyze how Coke takes advantage of global public works and government interventions to boost its place in world markets. In 1926, the company established its foreign department, a tiny but powerful cadre of lobbyists who schmoozed diplomats around the world, convincing them that importing Coke would spur local job growth, which it did: After all, bottlers needed to buy sugar and equipment locally. But, as Elmore points out, these measures offered \u201cprofound benefits to the parent company, dramatically cutting down shipping costs and relieving Atlanta from buying sweeteners, always a headache considering the wild fluctuations of sugar prices.\u201dWorld War II secured Coke\u2019s international dominance. The company negotiated government contracts to distribute Coke on the front lines, claiming the drink boosted morale. It went on to garner sugar-\u00adrationing exemptions allowing it to nab overseas military concessions and forge connections with elites abroad. Coke may have helped create jobs, but, Elmore says, \u201cthe people who really got rich from the soft drink business were families that were already the commercial captains of their communities.\u201d These new friends \u201cproved integral in negotiating access to foreign countries\u2019 valuable water resources.\u201dWhich brings us back to that parched village in southern India. After local activists petitioned the courts to shut down bottling operations in 2004, high concentrations of pesticides were found in Coke and Pepsi, and both were briefly banned. The legal battle continues, and the plant remains closed. But plant closures are rare. Protests in the Indian desert state of Rajasthan failed, despite studies showing Coke operations were even more of an environmental drain in dry areas with strained aquifers. Coke bottling persists in Rajasthan, Elmore found, because its politicians didn\u2019t want to risk losing their jobs. \u201cThis was the brilliance of Coca-Cola capitalism,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy not owning its many distributors and by relying on native intermediaries in foreign nations, Coke could claim that it was a critical component of the local economy. . . . Once embedded in host communities, Coca-Cola became very difficult to dislodge, even in places where it caused serious environmental problems, because killing Coke meant killing jobs. In impoverished communities, . . . the argument of dollars and cents won the day.\u201dOf course, the argument of dollars and cents has been known to win the day in rich communities as well. In the 1990s, Coke worked with McDonald\u2019s, its largest customer, to champion supersizing. In 2004, soft drinks became the largest single food source of calories in the American diet and helped spawn a diabetes epidemic. Elmore even finds evidence of Coke\u2019s greed in the history of American recycling programs. He recounts how Coke and the beverage lobby pushed taxpayer-\u00adfunded recycling programs in the late 1980s and 1990s, despite evidence that the old \u00adreturnable-bottle systems were cheaper and caused less waste. Since then, American taxpayers have borne the brunt of the company\u2019s disposal costs in part \u201cbecause the decentralized funding structure for recycling kept the collective costs of the system hidden.\u201d\u201cCitizen Coke\u201d began as a dissertation, and its points are lucid and logically presented; the language is accessible, and punchy chapter endings propel the story. But as a narrative, the structure is riddled with redundancies and leads to chronological whiplash. The morphine-addicted pioneer, for instance, dies at the beginning of the book only to keep reappearing in following chapters \u2014 without ever being fully rendered. How did that Gilded Age pharmacist become an outsourcing pioneer? How did he happen upon such an addictive sugar-delivery system \u201cthat made people feel good without overwhelming the tongue\u201d? And what of the unnamed \u201cNegro cook\u201d who supposedly managed most of Coke\u2019s early production, in violation of Jim Crow segregation laws? That cook returns as an example of lean operating costs, having managed the syrup mixing in a single copper kettle \u201cakin to something you might find in a charity soup kitchen.\u201dAlmost every time there\u2019s an opportunity for narrative sizzle, the book falls victim to a rigid structure and repetitiveness that more careful editing would have eliminated. Elmore misses opportunities to develop dramatic scenes or a more personal perspective, which is a shame: He grew up in Atlanta, Coke\u2019s hometown, and attended the same school as the longtime company C.E.O., Robert Woodruff, who donated millions to the institution.All the ingredients of an important work of nonfiction are here, but the recipe is off. Despite its historical sweep and important message, \u201cCitizen Coke\u201d suffers from saccharin flatness, like a twist-top soda bottle opened one too many times.CITIZEN COKEThe Making of Coca-Cola CapitalismBy Bartow J.

{"Headline": "Suddenly, BRIC Markets Are on a Shakier Foundation", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyInvesting in rapidly developing economies is an inherently risky proposition. That is why more than a decade ago, investors embraced what seemed a prudent approach: focusing on the BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 which have the largest and most liquid stock markets in the emerging-market world.Late last year, though, the BRIC strategy hit a wall as a worrisome series of developments unfolded.First, as the Chinese economy continued to decelerate, global growth expectations dropped, pushing down commodity prices. Then crude oil fell more than 40 percent in the fourth quarter, dropping below $50 last week. Mr. Jayaraman said that back in the 2000s, the BRIC markets represented opportunities driven by the so-called commodity supercycle. That was when rapid growth in countries like China and India drove up demand for natural resources, turbocharging the fortunes of developing nations that were big exporters of raw materials. Among the winners were Russia and Latin America, including Brazil. In general, strong growth shored up emerging-market currencies, improved the financial standing of developing nations and raised corporate profits in these regions. That virtuous cycle, though, has now morphed into a more vicious one.That\u2019s why investors can no longer focus merely on the biggest markets or even just the commodity-producing nations. Investors should start by focusing on countries that are net importers of oil and other commodities, money managers say. Falling energy costs are expected to bolster profits of companies based in those markets, and households should benefit because consumers will have more money to spend on discretionary items. Government budgets are also likely to get some help, Mr. Strabo said.Unlike China, which has excess capacity in major sectors of its economy, India is only now embarking on major infrastructure initiatives, just as prices on steel, copper and other commodities are weaker than they have been in several years.What\u2019s more, India is the world\u2019s third-biggest importer of oil. \u201cAs oil prices have fallen, that has helped lower India\u2019s current account deficit to under 2 percent of G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. Concerns about inflation have eased while the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been able to reduce fuel subsidies without hurting economic growth.One way to tell which economies are more fundamentally sound is to look at the volatile currency markets.For much of the past decade, the currencies of developing nations enjoyed relative strength, as these countries\u2019 economies were growing faster than those of the United States and Europe while also being less mired in debt. But as global economic risks have risen, investors have begun shifting out of emerging-market currencies and into the United States dollar.If other central banks in the emerging-market world followed Russia\u2019s lead, the higher rates could further brake economies that were already slowing.\u201cWe are entering a period of rising rates, so people need to gravitate toward the stronger currencies and countries that are running current-account and fiscal surpluses,\u201d said Mr. Jayaraman at Causeway, adding that he liked Taiwan and South Korea for that reason. At the same time, he said investors should be careful with Russia, Turkey and possibly Brazil.What are other economic signs to look for?Mr. Gray noted that years of cheap credit had sent money pouring into the developing world, making some of these countries vulnerable to turbulence now. \u201cIt\u2019s still an awfully troublesome time for this part of the world,\u201d he said.PAUL J.

{"Headline": "Japanese Designers Provide a Wealth of Ideas in Paris", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFashion ReviewPARIS \u2014 \u201cTo defy circumstance and live with joie de vivre!\u201d one Congolese dandy said, explaining his philosophy in a 2014 documentary about Les Sapeurs, or le Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ambianceurs et des Personnes \u00c9l\u00e9gantes (Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant Persons), and incidentally describing a fundamental purpose of fashion.Last week in Paris, fashion paid its own form of homage to Les Sapeurs. And while their economy may be mired in a prolonged slump, the Japanese designers here especially seemed to be revitalized by the pleasure to be taken in defying circumstance.Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus and Yohji Yamamoto mounted what were by most reasonable estimates the shows that \u2014 in a season when seemingly unchecked corporate budgets turned the meager ideas of some designers into bloated Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade floats \u2014 exemplified the Sapeur philosophy. That is, the most ineffably luxurious quantity in life is not material wealth so much as the human capital of talent and ideas.It is no small achievement at a time when fashion has become among the more costly forms of popular entertainment. Yet while Ms. Kawakubo and Mr. Yamamoto, and the former\u2019s onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Junya Watanabe, make exorbitantly expensive clothes, their designs are demonstrably generous with ideas anyone is free to share.Consider the Watanabe show, held on a payday morning in the Palais de Tokyo. The patterns of illumination magically refracted around the gallery space were produced by that most basic form of lighting technology, a revolving disco ball.The soundtrack opened to the strains of a 1970s hit by the Floaters, a group that emerged from the Sojourner Truth housing projects in Detroit at a time when the Motor City was on the skids. Mr. Watanabe explained afterward that the show had been inspired by the Sapeurs; in fact, he even cast some as models.It says a lot about this gifted designer that in what might have been just another fashion show \u201csampling\u201d the cultures of exotic others, he exhibited a respect for his sources that seemed both appropriate and overdue. He did so with clothes that married his own longstanding fascination with dandyism to an equally potent interest in traditional textiles and the thrifty repurposing custom of using patchwork.Last season, Mr. Watanabe made wonderful clothes piecing together patterned indigos in a manner known as boro. Here he assembled soberly colored cropped jackets, tailcoats, tuxedos and natty high-water trousers as if from scraps.The models wore top hats and Sweeney Todd side-whiskers. Some (the real Sapeurs, mostly) didn\u2019t walk the runway so much as stutter-step around it, striking insouciant freeze-frame poses, as if to remind viewers that great style is a matter of attitude.Mr. Yamamoto had his models made up with bruises and welts as if returning from a street brawl; the clothes, too, looked as if they had gotten the worst of it. Exposed seams, frayed hems, bovver boots and alley-cat styling played off a calculated reserve seemingly central to Mr. Yamamoto\u2019s mature design.Like any smart fighter, he has learned with age to conserve energy; in particular, a grouping of jackets in marbleized patterns of muted blue or green that looked flensed and reconstructed definitively demonstrated that, at 71, Mr. Yamamoto still has moves.Rei Kawakubo, too, seems still to live by the athlete\u2019s creed: stay hungry. Notoriously averse to self-explication, the gnomic designer nevertheless scatters clues to her current thinking. In a show set to a remix of Jocelyn Pook\u2019s music for the masked ball sequence of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d she alternated strict, almost constricting formal wear with skintight trousers and jackets covered with florid patterns designed by Joseph Ari Aloi, a.k.a. the graffiti artist JK5.The diagonal seams and uneven jacket hems seemed to reflect slippage, possibly of the conservative masculine ideas that are undergoing tectonic shifts. On the other hand, the legends blazoned on the clothes were unambiguous and easy enough to align with the frank antiwar message of last season\u2019s men\u2019s wear presentation.\u201cFight Off Your Demons,\u201d read a florid graffito on one shirt, worn with a bucket hat reminiscent either of a Watteau shepherdess or else Bunny Mellon. The slogan seemed like a good one to live by, particularly at a time when France remains stunned by the recent terrorist acts.It was a relief to find at least some designers making token references to social concerns, current politics and a wider world, since many here seemed preoccupied with chasing the elusive One Percent.Today a midlevel salaried worker in France earns under $2,000 a month on average. Rent on a Paris apartment can easily eat up two-thirds of that. Despite deep discounts on everything from spatulas to Saint Laurent jackets, the big department stores were notably empty throughout the sale season, which happens to coincide with the men\u2019s wear presentations. Was this a consequence of the terrorist attacks? Or was it instead a lingering effect of a Europe\u2019s prolonged economic downturn?Regardless of how beautiful the show, masterful the craftsmanship or prodigious a designer\u2019s skills, it was impossible to ignore or even sidestep the growing gap between the haves and everyone else.As it happened, the shows also overlapped with the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where people like Winnie Byanyima, head of Oxfam, patiently and repeatedly recited ugly litanies of the statistics underlying wealth inequality.Consequently it was with a kind of abstracted distance that one viewed shows like the \u201970s-inflected one Lucas Ossendrijver of Lanvin staged at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts; or the endearingly pretentious presentation Riccardo Tisci mounted for Givenchy (voodoo makeup, anyone?) in a tent adjacent to Napoleon\u2019s tomb; or another finely crafted one created by V\u00e9ronique Nichanian for Herm\u00e8s held in a heavily secured structure housing a French radio station against a windowed backdrop of gorgeously illuminated nocturnal Paris.Herm\u00e8s, of course, sits securely at the top of the luxury-goods food chain, and Ms. Nichanian understands her brief. Most design houses are struggling to define and capture a market consisting of young \u201cwealth creators,\u201d guys who, while they like clothes and fashion, have no particular interest in dressing like Dad.For that man, fancy track pants or sweats and a jacket \u2014 blouson, bomber, Perfecto, whatever \u2014 have become a kind of proto-uniform, the new suit. Ms. Nichanian\u2019s show demonstrated her skilled readiness to outfit this new consumer. If he wants sweats, she will give him sweats. Naturally, they\u2019ll be rendered in sheared mink.Similarly, Alessandro Sartori at Berluti has turned his very considerable talents to the reinvention of the 120-year-old shoemaking house, purchased nearly a decade ago by LVMH and recast by its new chief executive, Antoine Arnault, as a go-to label for the young rich.As the 37-year-old son of Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH and France\u2019s richest man, the handsome Mr. Arnault himself is probably his own target consumer, the kind of guy whose business life less often requires suits than, say, the unlined blazers to which Mr. Sartori brings mastery as a tailor.Maybe he prefers a throwaway trench coat in coated silk to toss on over jeans; or cuffed jogging pants of felted jersey; or cashmere hand-loomed with leather to create tweed. Tech refinements similar to those that inspire wristwatch aficionados to geek out over the latest dial innovation or tourbillion become, in Mr. Sartori\u2019s capable hands, intrinsic to Berluti\u2019s appeal.Jogging pants were ubiquitous this season, at Dior fashioned by Kris van Assche of leather and worn with a tailcoat. They looked vaguely silly on the runway and yet still plausible, as did a tailored denim suit layered with a skirt-length shearling gilet or a black leather parka worn with an improbable bow tie and cummerbund.Watching the show \u2014 expensively staged in a tennis club at the outskirts of Paris, and with a live orchestra playing a symphonic version of music by the French singer Koudlam \u2014 one could not help but think of what expandable-waist leather jogging pants might look like on real-world consumers. One imagined a guy rich enough to afford leather kiddie pants and enough of a schlump to enjoy wearing trousers that don\u2019t require a belt.Candidly and unfortunately, the image that came to mind was that of Seth Rogen. Once evoked it was, alas, impossible to un-see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Croatians Elect Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as Their First Female President", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 In an unexpectedly tight runoff, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, a conservative challenger, won Croatia\u2019s election on Sunday and is set to become the country\u2019s first female president.With more than 99 percent of the ballots counted, Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic, 46, won 50.4 percent of the votes, compared with 49.6 percent for President Ivo Josipovic, the center-left incumbent, the electoral commission said.The election took place in a climate of deep pessimism about Croatia\u2019s economy. The newest member of the European Union, Croatia has one of the weakest economies in the bloc, with an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent and youth unemployment running at 41.5 percent.\u201cLet\u2019s go together,\u201d Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic of the opposition Croatian Democratic Union said late Sunday in a speech laced with patriotic wording and interrupted by nationalist soccer chants. \u201cA difficult job awaits us. Let\u2019s unite. Let\u2019s unite our patriotism, love and faith in our Croatian homeland.\u201dHer speech suggested a return to the nationalistic politics that dominated Croatia in the postwar dissolution of Yugoslavia.A shift inward is common for fledgling European Union member states, according to Dejan Jovic, a political-science professor at the University of Zagreb and former political adviser to Mr. Josipovic. \u201cEnlargement and joining the E.U. opens up a nation, and a lot of nationalist sentiment sweeps in afterward,\u201d Mr. Jovic said by telephone.Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic is a former assistant secretary general at NATO and former Croatian ambassador to the United States. She also served as the minister of foreign and European affairs from 2005 to 2008, when her main priority was to guide Croatia into the European Union and NATO.Croatia\u2019s presidency is largely ceremonial, but the president has a say in foreign policy and is head of the army.The voting was considered an important test for political parties ahead of the next year\u2019s parliamentary elections. The increasingly unpopular Social Democratic Party, a dominant group in the center-left government that backed Mr. Josipovic, may take an even bigger hit in the polls after his loss.The turnout in the election was 58.5 percent, an increase over the first round on Dec. 28, which Mr. Josipovic, 57, narrowly won. Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic will become the fourth president of the former Yugoslav republic next month. Joanna Berendt reported from Warsaw, and Joseph Orovic from Zadar, Croatia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Lessons From Switzerland\u2019s One-Day, 18 Percent Currency Rise", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilThese are strange and unnerving times in global financial markets, and if Thursday\u2019s jaw-dropping move in the Swiss currency didn\u2019t prove it, nothing will.It is not every day that the currency of an advanced, economically important country rises by double-digit percentages against the currencies of other such countries within mere hours. But that is what happened to the Swiss franc on Thursday. It is up 18 percent against the euro as of Thursday morning, and at one point was up 39 percent. Currency strategists were searching for any analogue in modern history for a similarly abrupt move in major Western currency and coming up empty.The Swiss move offers interesting lessons about the oddly precarious state of the global economy, but first it\u2019s worth working through what exactly the Swiss National Bank has done.Back during the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, fear was high that banks in countries that use the euro would go belly up. If you were a company or rich person in a country like Greece or Italy or even France or Germany, fearful that the euro could go kablooey and your local banks with it, you were sorely tempted to catch a flight to Zurich or Geneva and deposit your money in a Swiss bank. Amid a general atmosphere of global panic, the same could be said of plenty of savers outside Europe: Russians, Middle Easterners, Chinese, you name it.All those people looking to park money in Switzerland, a country of only 8 million people, created incredible upward pressure on the Swiss franc. From the start of 2010 to mid-2011, the value of the franc rose 44 percent against the euro.Think about that for a minute. It would be as if dollars in the state of Virginia (with a population similar to Switzerland) suddenly were worth 44 percent more than the dollars used in the rest of the country. Virginians would be wealthier, but it would be a catastrophe for businesses in the state. Suddenly their costs would be 44 percent higher, effectively, than that of competitors in other states. Tourism would dry up; why go to a Virginia beach when it is 44 percent more expensive than a North Carolina beach?That\u2019s exactly the situation Swiss businesses faced. Swiss watchmakers, pharmaceutical firms and ski resorts were suffering mightily because a scary global economy made people want to park their money into Swiss banks.The Swiss National Bank came to the rescue. After its earlier efforts to cut interest rates hadn\u2019t done enough to dampen interest in the franc, it pulled out the big guns, and set a peg, announcing it wouldn\u2019t allow the franc to appreciate such that one euro buys fewer than 1.2 francs. It backed it by going onto foreign exchange markets at will and buying euros as necessary to defend the peg.It worked for a long time. But now, the European Central Bank looks to be on the verge of an extensive new effort to try to pump money into the European economy to get it out of its doldrums, which is creating downward pressure on the euro. The pressure is particularly pronounced against the dollar, the benchmark of global commerce, which is rising in part because of a strong United States economy and plans by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Meanwhile, Russia is a basket case, increasing the desire of Russian oligarchs to avoid exposure to a falling ruble.In other words, this situation is only going to get worse, which means we would be throwing Swiss francs down a money pit if we tried to continue defending the 1.2 currency peg.The central bank simultaneously cut interest rates, hoping to offset some of the damage in foreign exchange markets. It didn\u2019t work. The Swiss franc-to-euro exchange rate moved back to where it was before the peg was introduced. Shares of major Swiss companies like Nestle plummeted. Exporters in Switzerland (and people thinking of traveling there, such as the global elite soon heading to Davos for the World Economic Forum) are in for serious sticker shock.One can sympathize with the Swiss National Bank as it defended its peg in the face of mounting potential losses. But the bigger lesson here is this: The six years and counting of aggressive monetary activism out of major central banks like the Fed and E.C.B. may have rescued the global economy over and over. But it has also created a range of spillovers far beyond United States and European borders that people all around the world will be grappling with for a long time to come.An earlier version of the chart accompanying this article incorrectly labeled the units. The chart is intended to show the price of the euro in Swiss francs, not the price of the Swiss franc in euros. An earlier version of the article incorrectly switched the currencies in describing the peg set by the Swiss National Bank. It wouldn\u2019t allow the franc to appreciate such that one euro buys fewer than 1.2 francs, not the reverse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Lays Groundwork for Obama\u2019s Visit to India ", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNegotiations between India and the United States on issues like climate change, an agreement on civilian nuclear plants, military purchases, and investment and manufacturing rules have quickened in recent weeks because of Mr. Obama\u2019s coming visit. But it remains to be seen whether the president\u2019s trip will be mainly symbolic or if it will lead to significant agreements.Earlier in the day, Mr. Kerry participated in an investment conference in Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, Gujarat, which was attended by foreign officials, business leaders and international dignitaries like Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, and Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank.India\u2019s leaders are eager for more foreign investment to energize the nation\u2019s moribund economy, and the conference was devised to showcase a state where foreign investment has been welcomed in the past 10 years.When Mr. Modi led Gujarat as chief minister, he was able to smooth the way for foreign investors by speeding the bureaucratic decision-making process. Now that he is prime minister, he must rely more on legislative fixes. And despite having a large majority in the lower house of Parliament, Mr. Modi has yet to deliver many of the promised changes that investors are seeking.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to complete the circle of economic reforms speedily,\u201d Mr. Modi told the conference attendees. \u201cWe are planning to take a quantum leap.\u201dAttracted by such vows and by India\u2019s population of more than 1.2 billion people, representatives of foreign governments took turns proclaiming their determination to expand economic relations with India.\u201cJapan and India complete each other,\u201d said Yosuke Takagi, Japan\u2019s economic minister.During his presentation to the investment conference, Mr. Kerry underscored that the United States wanted to increase trade with India to $500 billion a year, a significant leap from $97 billion in 2013.\u201cWe can do more together, and we must do more together, and we have to do it faster,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.The two sides have also been talking for five years about how to navigate around an Indian nuclear liability law that American energy companies insist must be changed before they can build civilian plants in India. The Indians have long complained that American officials should be able to persuade the companies to invest anyway; the Americans say they do not have that power.\u201cI think there\u2019s a commitment on both sides to try to find a way through that,\u201d said a State Department official, who could not be identified under the agency\u2019s protocol for briefing reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that will be resolved in time for the president\u2019s visit.\u201dOn efforts to deal with climate change, a policy priority of the Obama administration, Indian officials have repeatedly rejected any notion that India \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases \u2014 should promise any limits on its emissions or growth. Indeed, the government is in the midst of a coal rush, and intends to double the nation\u2019s production of coal in the next five years.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to work with India on,\u201d the State Department official said. \u201cWe have, obviously, some things that we\u2019ve developed in the high technology area of solar panels that we\u2019d like to be able to bring to bear.\u201dDuring his visit here, Mr. Kerry also talked with Indian business executives and met with Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan, the first time in recent memory that an American secretary of state has met with a leader of the Himalayan nation.Mr. Kerry also toured an ashram that was established in 1917 by Mahatma Gandhi, who led the drive for Indian independence.\u201cGandhi\u2019s example inspires all of us to this day and for my generation helped to shape America,\u201d Mr. Kerry wrote in a guest book at the ashram.Michael R.

There is another option, of course: do nothing. No fiscal or monetary stimulus. Let the fire burn the rot of excess from the system. From the ashes, goes this theory, a healthier, more balanced economy will emerge.So opponents of government action \u2014 Tea Party Republicans, libertarians, devotees of Austrian economics \u2014 do have a plan of sorts. What they don\u2019t have is a compelling story to persuade policy makers or the public. The high school history book lesson of the Great Depression \u2014 government inaction in the face of economic upheaval courts collapse \u2014 dominates. Much like the Tin Woodman in that Depression-era classic movie, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d austerians and liquidationists require a testimonial. And it is the need for a success story that drives \u201cThe Forgotten Depression,\u201d by the financial journalist James Grant, the founder of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer. Subtitled \u201c1921: The Crash That Cured Itself,\u201d the book tells the tale of the other great slump of the early 20th century.Pre-World War II economic data can be dodgy, but by the measures Grant prefers, the 1920-21 downturn saw output fall by nearly 10 percent, stock prices cut almost in half and unemployment surge to about a fifth of the labor force. The contraction\u2019s severity can be seen in words as well as numbers. Grant points out the \u201cbitterly sardonic\u201d lyrics of the 1921 hit \u201cAin\u2019t We Got Fun,\u201d a song often associated with Roaring Twenties ebullience but one that he says was inspired by the decade\u2019s depressionary start: \u201cIn the winter, in the summer / Don\u2019t we have fun? / Times are bum and getting bummer / Still we have fun.\u201dBut music failed to soften hearts in Washington. Instead of splurging on shovel-ready jobs to stimulate growth, the budget was balanced. And rather than cut interest rates to boost borrowing, the new Federal Reserve tightened the money supply. As Grant writes: \u201cThe successive administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding met the downturn by seeming to ignore it \u2014 or by implementing policies that an average 21st-century economist would judge disastrous. . . . Yet by late 1921, a powerful, job-filled recovery was underway. This is the story of America\u2019s last governmentally unmedicated depression.\u201dFor Grant\u2019s flavor of austere, micro-government conservatism to expand its appeal, this is a story that must be told. The Great Depression narrative not only informs modern policy responses during crises, it\u2019s also the ur-justification for big government. But the present Not-So-Great Recovery \u2014 despite an $800 billion fiscal stimulus and inventive Fed monetary policy \u2014 has perhaps cracked open the window for a different story, one of \u201cinstructive inaction.\u201d And if the better way to deal with a downturn is for government to do nothing, then maybe government should do a whole lot less in other areas of life as well. Grant\u2019s forgotten depression is considered a natural economic experiment in economic freedom by those who think the American project went horribly off track with Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s election in 1932.Yet whatever the broader merits of Grant\u2019s minimalist philosophy, the supposed hands-off approach to the 1920-21 depression provides a poor argument for it. Grant\u2019s laissez-faire depression was actually an economic episode in which government \u2014 via its new central bank \u2014 played an active and critical role throughout. Grant himself concedes that \u201ceasier money\u201d helped account \u201cfor the power of the 1922 rebound.\u201d A better natural experiment for Grant\u2019s depression-fighting formula is what\u2019s happening in the eurozone right now. With a jobless rate over 11 percent, a combination of fiscal austerity and tight money is on the verge of sending the region into its third recession since 2007. But who knows, maybe it will generate a catchy tune or two.Grant\u2019s book is a lively exercise in economic nostalgia, a game effort to build a bridge to the pre-New Deal era when the tax burden was tiny, the dollar defined by gold and government let business do as it would. But as an economic guide for 21st-century policy makers in a crisis, the forgotten depression is best forgotten.THE FORGOTTEN DEPRESSION1921: The Crash That Cured ItselfBy James GrantIllustrated. 254 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28.James Pethokoukis is the DeWitt Wallace \u00adfellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a CNBC contributor.Advertisement"}

Some late Victorian Christians arguably stood between London\u2019s poorest and the Dickensian horrors suffered by the likes of Oliver Twist.Seth Koven visited this era in a previous book, \u201cSlumming: Sexual and Social Politics in Victorian London.\u201d Now, in \u201cThe Match Girl and the Heiress,\u201d inspired by a cache of private writings that reveal a profound relationship between two women activists, he delves deep into the historical record to build an intriguing story of cross-class devotion \u2014 between the social reformer Muriel Lester and \u201ca half-orphaned Cockney\u201d factory worker named Nellie Dowell.Lester was the daughter of a prosperous Baptist shipbuilder. Dowell\u2019s father was a mariner whose death at sea when she was only 5 hurled her and her siblings into poverty, away from their mother and into the cold care of the state. Lester, like many young women of her class and time, was trained to regard poorer women with a combination of pity and fascination. Koven points out that Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s \u201cThe Little Match Girl\u201d was but one of many novels and tracts that fetishized these unfortunates, provoking a kind of slumming tourism. Lester was 19 when she went to her first \u201cfactory girl\u201d party, and from then on she was hooked. \u201cI went, they conquered,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHow experienced they seemed. How assured! What natural dignity!\u201dLester preserved Dowell\u2019s letters \u2014 ungrammatical stream-of-\u00adconsciousness missives that Koven compares to the writing of Gertrude Stein \u2014 in a manila envelope. Lester\u2019s side of the correspondence is lost, but she did leave a half-\u00adfinished \u2014 or half-lost \u2014 biography of Dowell that ends abruptly, midsentence. Dowell served with Lester at Kingsley Hall, an institution devoted to the spiritual and physical needs of Dowell\u2019s East London neighborhood. She died at 47, weakened by childhood years spent in a bleak institution for wards of the state called Forest Gate School, where the students were addressed as \u201cChild\u201d rather than by their names.Dowell suffered increasingly wasting bouts of rheumatic fever, her ill health compounded by work in a factory manufacturing matches, one of the pre-electric age\u2019s most necessary products, fabricated \u201cat the cost of human agony and death,\u201d according to reformers. The active substance in matches, phosphorus, caused a hideously disfiguring necrosis called \u201cphossy jaw.\u201d Dowell avoided that disease, but by her early 30s she had lost the use of her left hand, crucial to maintaining her job on the assembly line stuffing matches into boxes at speed, 150 per packet, 12 hours a day \u2014 a job she held for two decades.Dowell and Lester, Koven believes, were bound together by a shared \u201cerotics of illness.\u201d Lester, who also experienced breakdowns, healed herself by concocting a personal cure: She was an early convert to vegetarianism and invented a form of meditation, her \u201cPrayer of Relaxation,\u201d that required an hour a day of \u201ccomplete solitude and uninterrupted silence.\u201d The story Koven tells can be engrossing, as long as the reader is comfortable with (or immune to) his weakness for critical theory lingo \u2014 when, say, the women \u201cfound a way to rhetorically enact mobile relations of reciprocity across the vast class divide\u201d or, as he comments on a letter, \u201cIntimacy, didacticism and inequality coexist within this epistolary trace.\u201dThe story is fattened up with a cast of courageous and sometimes strange late Victorian and early Edwardian characters, from Annie Besant (who lost her husband and children over her stand on contraception for the poor) to the popular preacher Swami Vivekananda; to Anglican ministers like Percy Dearmer and Francis Boyd (founders of the Guild of Health, which aimed to reconcile faith, modern science and psychoanalysis); and the African missionary Henry Grattan Guinness, who tried to bring Christian love to victims of King Leopold II\u2019s Congolese atrocities. But it\u2019s the lives of near-forgotten crusaders like Muriel Lester and Nellie Dowell that seem equally heroic, for whom \u201chuman dignity always trumped economy.\u201d THE MATCH GIRL AND THE HEIRESSBy Seth KovenIllustrated. 445 pp. Princeton University Press. $35.Nina Burleigh is a national politics correspondent for Newsweek.

{"Headline": "Greek Election Reflects a Deep Divide in Europe", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The Greek election not only strengthened opponents of austerity, it also highlighted a fundamental tension at the heart of Europe\u2019s six-decade-long push to forge a closer union of democratic states: what to do when voters in different countries have different, even opposite, demands.But beneath the arguments over austerity is a deeper conflict of democratic wills, between the verdict of voters in Greece, who are desperate for some relief, and those in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, who do not want their taxes used to underwrite a blank check for countries that get into financial trouble.\u201cUltimately, this is a clash of democracies, rather than a clash of ideas,\u201d said Mats Persson, director of Open Europe, a research organization in London. \u201cVoters in Germany and Greece want very different things.\u201dMore than that, he added: \u201cGermans and Greeks have fundamentally different views on how to run an economy. The Greek vote will force a rethink to some extent in northern Europe, and Germany may agree to some loosening of terms, but it won\u2019t fundamentally change its approach.\u201dIndeed, while Greece\u2019s newly sworn-in prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, declared Syriza\u2019s victory the death knell for austerity, Peter Altmaier, chief of staff of Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellery, ruled out any sharp shift in policy.\u201cWe have pursued a policy which works in many European countries, and we will stick to it in the future,\u201d he told reporters on Monday in Berlin.In a first test of how the European Union will deal with the political earthquake in Athens, finance ministers of the eurozone, the 19-nation bloc that uses Europe\u2019s common currency, gathered in Brussels late on Monday for a previously scheduled meeting.They made no concrete decisions on Greece but pledged to begin negotiations with the new government in Athens, whose dominant party, Syriza, made a softening of terms imposed by creditors a central part of its election campaign.\u201cWe are democracies,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the bloc\u2019s economic policy chief, said at a news conference after the finance ministers\u2019 meeting. \u201cWhen the people vote, we can\u2019t ignore that vote. There shouldn\u2019t be a division, either a geographical or ideological one.\u201dJeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the group of finance ministers from countries using the euro, said he did \u201cnot believe in this north-south divide,\u201d noting that \u201cthere are a lot of countries in the north, think of the Baltics; in the south, think of Spain; and Ireland\u201d in the west, and they \u201chave done major reforms, and they are all back on the growth track.\u201dHe added that negotiation with Greece on the terms of a bailout, extended to the end of February under an agreement with the defeated previous government, \u201cmay be simple and quick, and it may be slow and difficult, but we don\u2019t know yet.\u201dBut in a sign of just how divided opinion is between Germany and Greece, the biggest-selling German newspaper, Bild, responded to the Greek election by asking how many extra billions the Greeks would cost German taxpayers.(Not mentioned by the newspaper was the fact that so far all of the bailout money provided to Greece, to which Germany has been a major contributor, has come in the form of loans that have not yet fallen due.)Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and Europe\u2019s most powerful voice in economic policy, has bristled at her image as an unbending pro-austerity scold, asking the World Economic Forum in Davos last week \u201cnot to conduct discussions in black- and-white terms.\u201d\u201cOften, so-called austerity is pitted against the model of growth and investment,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is completely false.\u201dAll the same, Ms. Merkel has been unswerving in demanding from European neighbors steps that will cut public spending and introduce budgetary discipline. In Berlin\u2019s view, injecting more cash into Europe\u2019s economy without first securing tighter budgets risks allowing debtor nations to avoid or postpone financial steps they will eventually have to make.This stern approach enjoys wide support among German voters, even those who vote for her rivals. The center-left Social Democratic party, with which the center-right Ms. Merkel governs in a \u201cgrand coalition,\u201d for example, has shown no inclination to cut its political allies governing in Italy or France any slack in meeting European Union budget limits or missing other targets.\u201cThe Greeks have the right to elect whoever they want; we have the right to no longer finance Greek debt,\u201d Hans-Peter Friedrich, a senior member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said Monday, according to Bild. \u201cThe Greeks must now pay the consequences and cannot saddle German taxpayers with them.\u201dThe outcome of the Greek election provided a second blow to Ms. Merkel\u2019s economic prescriptions, coming on the heels of an announcement last week by the European Central Bank that it would buy up 60 billion euros worth of government bonds, or about $67 billion, starting in March in the hopes of spurring growth.Mario Draghi, the president of the bank, had been slowly building support for this policy since a meeting of bankers in August in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and he visited Ms. Merkel in Berlin eight days before last Thursday\u2019s announcement, apparently for consultations.But Ms. Merkel had long opposed a loosening of monetary policy and government spending for stimulus, and her opponents nonetheless regarded the bank\u2019s announcement as a defeat for her tough line on debt.Tasked with adjudicating between the irreconcilable positions of voters in Greece and those in northern Europe is the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the European Union and a frequent target of attack by Syriza and anti-establishment parties across Europe on both the left and the right.Even before the successive blows to the German position, the commission months ago throttled back its demands for spending cuts and other austerity measures.The bloc\u2019s new economic policy chief, Mr. Moscovici, a former French finance minister, warned in an interview last month that Europe\u2019s post-World War II push for greater integration was \u201creally in danger\u201d because too many citizens now believe \u201cthat European policies are only about austerity.\u201dBut Brussels, under pressure from Germany and like-minded northern European countries, has still resisted calls for a retreat from budget targets that critics say have only strangled growth.Before the Greek election, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, spoke against the dangers of a \u201cwrong result\u201d and seemed to endorse the incumbent prime minister, Antonis Samaras, saying he would like to see \u201cfamiliar faces\u201d win.His spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, on Monday sought to repair the damage. Asked at a news conference in Brussels whether Mr. Juncker would apologize to the winner, Mr. Tsipras, the spokesman noted that Mr. Juncker had known Mr. Tsipras for some time and said \u201cthere is ample room for interpretation of what a familiar face is.\u201dIn its only formal response to the Greek election, the commission on Monday issued a wooden statement, declaring that it \u201cfully respects the sovereign and democratic choice of the Greek people,\u201d but offering no words of congratulation to Syriza.At the same time, it heaped praise on the \u201cremarkable progress\u201d made by Greece \u201cin recent years,\u201d a period of center-right leadership that put in place many of the measures demanded by Brussels but which voters firmly rejected on Sunday.The commission also indicated that it expected the new Greek government led by Syriza to continue with \u201creforms,\u201d often a euphemism for cost-cutting austerity measures as well as broader structural changes favored by Berlin. \u201cWe stand ready to continue assisting Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges,\u201d the statement said.Brussels, said Mr. Persson of Open Europe, \u201cis in a tricky position. The commission is the technocratic expression of austerity,\u201d but \u201cit is not really calling the shots\u201d in a debate dominated by individual countries, notably Germany. \u201cWhenever there is a big debate about money, power migrates to national capitals and the commission becomes a bystander.\u201dAndrew Higgins reported from Brussels, and Alison Smale from Berlin. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

In 2015, they might be Europe\u2019s catchphrase.What does the Continent need? Most economists and pundits focus on monetary and fiscal policy, as well as labor-market reform. Get the policy levers and economic incentives right, and the Continent might escape the vortex of decline, right?Some readers might regret the pope\u2019s use of language \u2014 we love our grandmothers, weary with disorientation or not. But as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Nicholas Eberstadt shows in his research, the pope\u2019s analysis is fundamentally sound.Next, look at fertility. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the last time the countries of the European Union were reproducing at replacement levels (that is, slightly more than two children per woman) was the mid-1970s. In 2014, the average number of children per woman was about 1.6. That\u2019s up a hair from the nadir in 2001, but has been falling again for more than half a decade. Imagine a world where many people have no sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts or uncles. That\u2019s where Europe is heading in the coming decades. On the bright side, at least there will be fewer Christmas presents to buy.There are some exceptions. France has risen to exactly two children per woman in 2012, from 1.95 in 1980, an increase largely attributed to a system of government payments to parents, not a change in the culture of family life. Is there anything more dystopian than the notion that population decline can be slowed only when states bribe their citizens to reproduce?Yet as bad as that is, the United States looks decent compared with most of Europe. Our friends across the Atlantic like to say that we live to work, while they work to live. That might be compelling if more of them were actually working. According to the most recent data available from the World Bank, the labor force participation rate in the European Union in 2013 was 57.5 percent. In France it was 55.9 percent. In Italy, just 49.1 percent.One bright spot might seem to be immigration. In 2012, the median age of the national population in the European Union was 41.9 years, while the median age of foreigners living in the union was 34.7. So, are Europeans pleased that there will be new arrivals to work and pay taxes when the locals retire?None of this should give Americans cause for schadenfreude. At a purely practical level, a European market in further decline will suppress American growth. But more important, European deterioration will dissipate the vast good the Continent can do in spreading the values of democracy and freedom around the world.So what is the prescription for Europe\u2019s ills \u2014 and the lesson for America\u2019s future? It is true that good monetary and fiscal policies are important. But the deeper problems in Europe will not be solved by the European Central Bank. No matter what the money supply and public spending levels, a country or continent will be in decline if it rejects the culture of family, turns its back on work, and closes itself to strivers from the outside. Europe needs visionary leaders and a social movement to rediscover that people are assets to develop, not liabilities to manage. If it cannot or will not meet this existential challenge, a \u201clost decade\u201d will look like a walk in the park for Grandma Europe.Arthur C.

{"Headline": "Gloom Lifts, and Obama Goes All Out", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 The morning after major Democratic losses in last year\u2019s midterm elections, President Obama walked into the Roosevelt Room with a message for his despondent staff: I\u2019m not done yet.\u201cThese next two years are going to be the most interesting time in our lives,\u201d he told them, according to a person in the meeting that day. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama offered an estimated 30 million viewers a glimpse of that attitude when he delivered a self-assured, almost cocky State of the Union address after a year in which current and former White House advisers said he was often frustrated and at times discouraged.\u201cThe president holding back is counterproductive,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director, who described the president as feeling liberated and emboldened. Although Republicans said Tuesday\u2019s speech was further evidence that Mr. Obama lives in an alternate reality, divorced from their belief that voters repudiated the president\u2019s agenda last year, inside the West Wing, there was relief that the sometimes brooding leader of the past year was gone.The president\u2019s state of mind, White House aides said, is a striking change from last winter, when Mr. Obama was mired in legislative gridlock and watching his approval rating sink in the aftermath of the botched HealthCare.gov rollout. By June, he was trying to stop the tide of immigrants streaming across the border from Mexico. It was not until well into the summer, when overseas crises in Ukraine and Syria forced him to engage, that Mr. Obama seemed energized, people close to him said.They said the presidential funk returned during the congressional elections last fall, when Mr. Obama was so unpopular that members of his own party told him to stay away from their campaigns. He felt constrained from forcefully promoting his policies, like his plans to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system and fight climate change, for fear of undermining Democratic Senate candidates in conservative states. The same concerns forced him to pull back on some planned executive actions, current and former advisers said.In September, realizing the elections would go badly for Democrats, Denis McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, began a series of White House meetings, many of them with the president, aimed at determining how Mr. Obama would use his last two years in office and how he would frame the political debate in this year\u2019s State of the Union address.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the outcomes of the elections were,\u201d one top adviser said, \u201cbut we knew they weren\u2019t going to be good.\u201dThat process involved meetings with speechwriters and policy officials from past administrations and a lengthy review of how former Republican and Democratic presidents handled State of the Union speeches after bruising election losses. Mr. Obama and his aides concluded that there was little to be gained by dwelling on the election results. And they decided that nothing in the president\u2019s relationship with Republican lawmakers suggested that a speech filled with offers of compromise would lead to a surge of legislative successes.In a series of strategy meetings in December, the president\u2019s staff presented him variations on the same theme: Focus on closing the gap for the middle class, and don\u2019t worry about how the Republicans who now control Congress will respond to your agenda.\u201cWe decided we couldn\u2019t hold back from making proposals in the State of the Union because of how the House and Senate Republicans might react to the speech,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. \u201cUs trimming our sails to try to game out where they may be on an issue doesn\u2019t further our prospect for legislation.\u201dMr. Obama began sketching out the State of the Union speech on Election Day last year, sitting with Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter, and Brian Deese, who was in charge of developing the speech\u2019s policy proposals. The three of them, along with other top aides, batted around some offbeat ideas, including whether Mr. Obama could deliver the address somewhere other than before Congress. They also considered holding a town hall-style event with lawmakers at the Capitol instead of giving the speech, aides said. They quickly rejected those ideas as unworkable.But Mr. Obama was clear on one thing, aides said: The economy\u2019s improvement gave him the confidence to be unapologetic in his proposals. He entered the House chamber Tuesday night with a \u201cspring in his step,\u201d one adviser said, believing his economic policies were finally taking hold.\u201cSometimes, a speech like that looks like he\u2019s being provocative,\u201d said Phil Schiliro, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s top legislative liaison in the president\u2019s first term. \u201cBasically, all he\u2019s doing is saying what the facts are.\u201dCurrent and former aides to the president said developing the speech on Tuesday had reminded them of the president\u2019s attitude as he prepared to deliver his second inaugural address after the 2012 election. The remarks that Mr. Obama delivered on that cold morning in 2013 were designed as a forceful statement of liberal principles in the face of near-certain Republican opposition.\u201cThe president was thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t want to shrink from the big challenges,\u2019\u00a0\u201d recalled Jon Favreau, the president\u2019s former speechwriter, who wrote Mr. Obama\u2019s second inaugural address. Of Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address, he said, \u201cMore than anything, this is the second act of that speech.\u201dBut the aftermath of the inaugural address could serve as a cautionary tale for the president and his staff at the White House as they move into the final phase of his presidency. In the two years after the inaugural speech, Mr. Obama failed to enact much of his ambitious agenda: gun control, an immigration overhaul, climate change legislation, a bipartisan budget deal and a minimum-wage increase. Much of the president\u2019s domestic agenda was hijacked by a series of overseas crises.The lesson may be that even a powerful speech is no guarantee of success in a political environment where the opposition party controls Congress and a volatile world regularly surprises. But White House officials said the president remained an optimist.\u201cHe feels better about things,\u201d one top aide said. \u201cHe feels like what we\u2019ve been doing is taking hold. That gives him confidence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeding the Beast With Ever-Cheaper Oil", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOOD news! Oil prices have dropped through the floor.Or is it bad news? That depends entirely on whose news you\u2019re talking about. For most of us, the most immediate impact of the price of a barrel of crude dipping below $50 is lower prices at the fuel pump. It wasn\u2019t long ago that I paid more than $3.50 a gallon to gas up; during my visit to Texas over the holidays, I marveled at a gas-station receipt for $1.96 a gallon. I\u2019m thinking of having it framed. Or maybe bronzed. I\u2019m getting a little teary here.Today\u2019s prices made filling up the tank \u2014 a big tank, because the rental agency upgraded me to an S.U.V. from the more economical car I\u2019d asked for \u2014 something close to a tawdry thrill.But great as that was for me, cheap oil isn\u2019t good for everybody. For example, it\u2019s part of what sent the Russian ruble into a tailspin. That, in turn, is bad news for Vladimir V. Putin. (Which many people would see as good news \u2014 a problem he can\u2019t fix by jailing somebody or taking off his shirt. But I digress.) Many nations and states balance their budgets on oil revenue, and, closer to home, many stock portfolios invest heavily in the energy sector. Tracking the pros and the cons of falling energy prices can give you a bad case of whiplash. For example, damage to energy industries\u2019 prospects is good news to those who want to see us move away from investment in fossil fuels and hope to curb climate change. Yet low oil prices make renewable energy sources like solar and wind less attractive financially, making it harder to curb climate change. On the other hand, the lower prices could also allow the government to finally raise the gas tax. After all, this tax finances highway construction, and it hasn\u2019t been raised for two decades. But \u2014 ha-ha! \u2014 who am I kidding? We don\u2019t raise taxes in this country. Oh, it\u2019s good to laugh. It\u2019s good! It\u2019s bad! Who knows?The strangest effect of low energy prices is that for every dollar off the cost of a barrel of oil, American consumers seem to lose an I.Q. point. We turn away from economical, fuel-saving cars and go back to our beloved gas guzzlers, as if we believe low prices will last forever. That is the triumph of hope over experience.I could buy something even bigger \u2014 say, the kind of tour bus that rock stars use, with lavish quarters in the back for sleeping and partying. I missed my chance last year to buy one of Willie Nelson\u2019s old \u201cHoneysuckle Rose\u201d buses, which sold for $80,000 \u2014 a steal, considering that you might get a contact high from the leftover pot smoke wafting out of the old upholstery. I could pay for one of those instead of, say, sending my youngest to college. After all, don\u2019t I deserve the best? And if we\u2019re not going to fix our highways or the environment, what kind of future is he going to have, anyway?Here\u2019s the problem, though. Once I start, I can\u2019t stop. Why settle for a ho-hum Hummer when, if I really want to impress the neighbors, I can buy an actual military armored transport vehicle?And these vehicles are a prudent choice: There\u2019s probably plenty of room in back for those big packages of toilet paper from Costco.CLEARLY, there is money to be made from this thinking. I am not the only stupid person out there. I am not even a leading indicator of stupidity. If I want to consume conspicuously, plenty of others must be ready to consume not just conspicuously, but also flagrantly, even idiotically. Smart guys can profit from the excess of others. Sure, you could be boring and look into energy mutual funds, on the assumption that things will turn up again sometime. But isn\u2019t it better to bet on guzzling and consumption \u2014 to create a portfolio based on big honking vehicles and wretched excess? Wall Street, this is your m\u00e9tier. Nobody knows excess like y\u2019all do. Will you step up? Everybody talks about trying to get in on the smart money. But there have got to be even bigger profits on betting dumb.This won\u2019t last. We\u2019ve all been here before, and know that what goes down will go up again. But until it does, let\u2019s party \u2014 and profit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Fall to Lowest Since 2009", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices took another sharp turn downward on Monday to levels not seen since the depths of the 2009 recession. Several international banks predicted even lower prices later this year because of an oversupplied global crude market.The drop came even as Venezuela and Iran coordinated their efforts to persuade OPEC to cut production; Canadian Natural Resources, a major global producer, announced deep investment cuts; and American companies dropped their rig drilling count at quickening speed.The day\u2019s plunge began after Goldman Sachs released a bearish oil report Sunday night predicting that the American price benchmark, which dropped to about $46 a barrel on Monday, would fall to $41 in three months and $39 in six months \u2014 before recovering to $65 by the end of the year.\u201cWe believe this bear market will likely be characterized by more of a U-shaped recovery in which markets take longer to recover,\u201d the Goldman Sachs report said, \u201cand will likely rebound to far lower prices from where they sold off from.\u201dDrivers continue to enjoy the benefits of the oil price drop. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Monday was $2.13, according to the AAA auto club, 7 cents lower than a week ago, 47 cents lower than a month ago and $1.17 below a year ago. The club said that 18 states now had average gas prices that were under $2 a gallon and that \u201cthis number could rise to 25 by the end of next week given current trends.\u201dOil analysts say the 93-million-barrel-a-day global oil market has a supply surplus of one million to two million barrels, and that surplus is not going away soon.American production, which has grown by more than a million barrels a day in each of the last three years because of a frenzy of shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas, is still growing, though at a slower rate. The United States onshore rig count, according to the Baker Hughes oil service company, dropped by 60 rigs the second week of January, but the count still remains little changed from a year ago since rigs are typically rented on multiyear contracts.Elsewhere, production and exports are still growing in several countries, most notably Iraq.Slowing economic growth in Europe and parts of the developing world is curbing demand. And as the Goldman Sachs report noted, a decade of investments in global land storage and tankers means that producers can keep producing oil to keep up their revenue without running out of room to store their excess crude oil output.But oil experts say a long-term price at current levels could substantially sidetrack the American oil industry, or at least cause intense financial pain to many smaller companies that have borrowed heavily to drill in areas outside the most productive shale rocks.\u201cThe pain limit for U.S. shale drillers was reached when U.S. oil prices dropped below $50 a barrel,\u201d said Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis for Rystad Energy, a Norwegian-based global consultancy.In a paper released on Monday, Mr. Nysveen noted that oil companies in the United States had begun this year for the first time to decommission horizontal drilling rigs capable of probing through dense shale rocks in the Bakken field in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin fields in Texas. Those three fields have represented the backbone of American oil production renaissance in recent years.The number of rigs in operation in those fields declined to 675 rigs last week, from 700. By Rystad\u2019s calculations, 500 rigs are needed to be operating in those three giant fields to keep production there flat.The best event for a quick rebound in oil prices would be a reversal of OPEC\u2019s decision last month to leave its production essentially unchanged. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela traveled to various gulf producing countries over the weekend to persuade them to do just that. Senior Iranian officials agreed that several political opponents \u2014 a veiled reference to the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2014 were trying to undercut them by using oil as a political weapon.However, Saudi Arabia, the most powerful member of OPEC, would agree only to form a commission with Venezuela to periodically review prices.OPEC is supposed to be a cartel, but its members are competing fiercely for market share. Just last week the United Arab Emirates joined Iraq and Kuwait in trying to undercut Saudi Arabia, ostensibly a close ally, by pricing its crude below Saudi levels in Asia.The discounts have become increasingly necessary because the United States is importing less OPEC oil virtually every month, and oil once destined for the United States is being sent to China, India and the rest of Asia instead.\u201cSqueezed is a good word for the OPEC exports to the Asian markets,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economics Research, a consultancy, who has advised OPEC in recent years. \u201cThat won\u2019t change until you get cooperation among the various members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia. The lower the price goes, the closer we are getting to a breaking point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Head of India\u2019s Central Bank Criticizes Post-Crisis Efforts", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. and A.MUMBAI, India \u2014 Raghuram G. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has a reputation for bluntness. A former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, he has criticized central banks around the globe for focusing too much on their domestic issues instead of considering the international ramifications of their decisions.In a broad-ranging interview on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Rajan talked about the role that central banks should play in financial markets and the challenges he faces in India. The following are edited highlights from the interview with Keith Bradsher.\u201cMy sense is that industrial countries are looking inwards so much that expecting international cooperation for anything other than the crisis of the day is probably wishful thinking. See, these are all attempts to \u2014 what\u2019s the right word \u2014 to sensitize thinking. And I think that the speech had that effect.\u201cIn fact, many people have come around to the point of the speech that additional Q.E. is largely about exchange rates \u2026 than really energizing a lot of domestic activity. I think that is now a much more widely held view than when I started talking about it.\u201cBut the point, I think, is that it had had the benefit of at least making people aware that when the time comes, when sort of market volatility creates the crisis somewhere, that there is a need for the international system to come together to fix it. You know, I was hoping we would put in place a system anticipating crisis, but if it is post-crisis, at least making sure we can pick up the pieces reasonably efficiently.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the best we can hope for in this scenario, where there has been so much demand of different political systems that there has been no space or energy left to look outside and say, \u2018What else can happen?'\u201d\u201cI was talking to some market participants, and they were extremely worried about the extent of volatility that can emerge in markets in a very short run, one example being oil prices. I mean, this is a very deep market. And overnight, virtually overnight, maybe in a span of a month or two, it has gone from $100 a barrel to $50.\u201cNow, what were the events that changed this? Was $100 too high? Is $45 too low? Or is there such a range of possibilities? And then if you think, this asset can move so much, and of course the dollar has moved \u2014 could we see enormous volatility in asset prices going forward?\u201cThat is a concern, and it is a concern I have been expressing for some time. That is, have central banks suppressed volatility through these policies.\u201cEffectively, every time prices move considerably, some central bank or the other says, \u2018Wait a minute, wait a minute, I\u2019m going to give you some fresh liquidity,\u2019 and we essentially offer a put option to the markets. So it\u2019s not a Bernanke put or the Greenspan put. Now it\u2019s the universal central bank put. Have we, in an attempt to banish volatility \u2014 which wasn\u2019t, I think a direct objective of any central bank, but indirectly, we\u2019ve come to that \u2014 created the danger of much more volatility.\u201d\u201cOne of our attempts here is to make sure that the system is evenhanded, that the large guy also repays, or if he or she cannot repay, that the debtholders have strong recovery rights. Now that\u2019s work in progress. But it is extremely important to make the system legitimate.\u201cOne of the worries about capitalism is \u2018heads the capitalist wins, and tails the system loses, but the capitalist is O.K. all the time.\u2019 To get a proper capitalist \u2014 or I should rather say, free enterprise \u2014 system in this country, we certainly need people to have the ability to take risk. But if they do take the risk, they should pay the costs of taking that risk, rather than benefit when that risk pays off, but shove the cost on somebody else when it doesn\u2019t.\u201cAnd that has been one of the big focuses of the last few months: How do we get the big promoter to absorb the losses and not shove it onto the banks?

The objects of their displeasure were the new trade agreements currently being negotiated by the administration.\u201cSince I\u2019ve been in Congress, I\u2019ve never seen a trade bill that in any way benefited U.S. manufacturers and workers,\u201d said Representative Louise Slaughter, who has represented the Rochester area for 28 years. She pointed to Kodak as an example of a company harmed by trade accords, especially the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Since the deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico went into effect in 1994, Kodak\u2019s Rochester work force has shrunk to 2,300 from 39,300.\u201cWe are fighting for the future of middle-class families,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. \u201cThese trade deals make it much easier for corporations to send American jobs overseas.\u201d Over the past 20 years, Connecticut has lost more than 96,000 manufacturing jobs, she said, because of agreements that failed to protect American workers. Sanders told the assembled media that while he liked the president\u2019s speech, \u201che was wrong on one major issue, and that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d He added, \u201cI do not believe that continuing a set of bad policies, policies that have failed, makes any sense at all.\u201dYet, while the Republican leadership has vowed to work with President Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (as well as on another deal being negotiated with the European Union), the Democrats have been vocal in their opposition. In the short term, they don\u2019t want to give the president so-called fast-track authority, which would allow the administration to negotiate the deal and then hand Congress a finalized agreement that it could only vote up or down, with no amendments. (Fast-track procedures have been used to conclude 14 trade agreements since 1974.)You\u2019d need a heart of stone not to be sympathetic to the concerns of the Democrats. Over the last two decades, lots of manufacturing jobs have vanished in the United States, inflicting a great deal of pain on workers. During those same 20 years, Nafta has been in force. Linking those job losses to the existence of Nafta is a leap the Democrats \u2014 and progressives in general \u2014 have made.Edward Gresser, the executive director of Progressive Economy, a left-leaning think tank, noted that other factors were taking place at the same time as Nafta: the growth of container ships, the lowering cost of communications, the rise of global industries. With or without trade deals, globalization is an unstoppable force. What Nafta really is, Gresser told me, is a proxy for globalization. One mistake the Nafta negotiators made more than two decades ago was taking worker rights and environmental protections out of the agreement itself and putting them into a side letter. They were never effectively enforced. Those negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership expect to rectify that error this go-round. They are also aiming to pry open the Japanese auto and agricultural markets to American producers, and include protections for a free and open Internet. It has, in other words, a lot more potential to do good than harm. When I spoke to Slaughter on Thursday afternoon, she was still riled up. \u201cThese crazy trade agreements,\u201d she called them at one point. She added, \u201cRochester really suffered.\u201dBut then her tone brightened. She told me about all the new companies \u2014 55 in all, she said \u2014 that had taken space in the old Kodak buildings. Some were even run by former Kodak engineers. Which, of course, is precisely the way globalization is supposed to work. Advertisement"}

Most of a day\u2019s output \u2014 the goods and services produced \u2014 was skipped as workers hunkered down at home, having been warned that it might take two days to dig out from a storm that was forecast to dump more than two feet of snow on the city.The winter storm this week, predicted to be one of the worst ever to hit New York City, failed to deliver much of a blow. But it still brought the city to a halt.Children enjoyed the snow at Waterside Plaza, with the Queensboro Bridge in the background.\u00a0\u201cI have three kids home from school today,\u201d Mr. Gold said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re watching an on-demand movie. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re spending money on things that normally we would not have made a purchase of today.\u201dPlanalytics estimated that the storm wiped out about $500 million in sales in the Northeast that will not be recovered. At least half of that would have come from New England, where the storm was most severe. Only about one-third to half of that total would have come from the New York City area, Mr. Gold said.Mr. Gold said he could not venture a guess about the share of that loss that could be attributed to the decisions by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City to shut down the subway and commuter lines Monday and to order everyone off the streets.But other city officials were more forgiving. Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office, said the shutdowns \u201clook like a mistake because the storm didn\u2019t materialize as the National Weather Service predicted.\u201d But it was a less costly error than the underreaction by the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to a snowstorm on the day after Christmas in 2010. \u201cThe risk of being wrong is extremely costly if the storm were anywhere near as big as forecast,\u201d Ms. Lowenstein said.Scott M. Stringer, the city\u2019s comptroller, said \u201cthe impact of any limited weather event on the economy of the city is generally small and transitory.\u201d Some working people may lose wages, he said, \u201cbut the vast majority of our city\u2019s economic activity \u2014 real estate transactions, retail sales and other consumer spending \u2014 either continues on as normal or is just displaced to another day.

K.?\u201d one surfer yelled across the water to another on a recent morning.\u201cI fine!\u201d K. K. yelled back. Her smile was enormous. \u201cI just caught a big wave.\u201dBut as death goes on, life goes on, each as stubborn as the other.Every morning, thousands of people march in from the thick green hills ringing Freetown, the capital, to take their places at their desks, or in their sheet metal kiosks, or along the main roads, where so much of the economy \u2014 from mangoes and stacks of trousers to plastic pipes and buckets of gravel \u2014 trades hands.Plucky entrepreneurs are turning tragedy into art, and commerce, by making low-budget Ebola movies that sell for $2 a DVD. Roasting chickens twirl away in the windows of Lebanese restaurants, where people gather for lunch and a flick through the papers for the latest round of bad news. Hoteliers say business has plummeted, but they keep up a positive front.\u201cMorning, brudda. Morning, sista,\u201d the clerks belt out each new day.Journals, a fixture of the international section, allow correspondents to step back from the news and write about places that intrigue them. We hope you enjoy our choices.The club was just getting going when Ebola hit. The idea behind the club, founded in 2012 by poor fishermen and run like a cooperative, was to enhance ecotourism, protect Sierra Leone\u2019s pristine coastline and create some jobs. Bureh Beach is the only surf club in the country, and the 30 or so surfers in it eke out a living by renting out boards and cooking up beachside meals for tourists, who used to arrive in scores. These days, they mostly see the lone aid worker or a few others swept in to work on Ebola.The sign at the beach\u2019s entrance, scratched on an old surfboard, says it all: \u201cDi Waves Dem Go Mak U Feel Fine.\u201dJahbez Benga, a slab of muscle who used to be a journeyman fisherman until he stood up on a surfboard for the first time and never looked back, said surfing was like therapy, especially during times like these.\u201cWhen you\u2019re inside the water,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about anything, not Ebola, not nothing, just the waves.\u201dThe Bureh surfers do a Zen-like job of blocking everything out as they carve up the lips of ocean rollers and cruise in the foam. But all around their little cove, others, even the ones who have been lucky enough to survive Ebola, are struggling to put their lives back together.George Bangalie, who lives about an hour away, barely remembers his descent into sickness. He was dizzy, then delirious, then rushed into an Ebola clinic. All he can recall now are the moans of patients, the faceless doctors and the blur of nurses and cleaners and body men peering down over him, covered head to toe in yellow plastic suits.\u201cIt was like I seeing a different world,\u201d he said.Mr. Bangalie has recovered from Ebola and is now back in his old world, a slum.\u201cI feel better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really need a job.\u201dFor many Ebola patients, exercise was an important piece of their recovery. Maybe it was simply psychological, but many survivors said they built back their strength by jogging laps around the clinics and doing push-ups on the ward\u2019s concrete floors, at their doctors\u2019 encouragement.That vigor seems to be part of Sierra Leone\u2019s national ethos, especially now, when so many people are fixated on staying healthy. Freetown\u2019s streets thicken at dawn with men and women decked out in the latest and brightest spandex \u2014 jogging, stretching, jumping rope, or doing situps and push-ups in the grass.On Sunday mornings, some streets and roundabouts are so packed with fitness buffs that it looks as if a triathlon is about to start. It is not unusual to turn a corner and find a grown man enthusiastically doing jumping jacks, by himself, in the middle of the road.At Bureh Beach, everyone looks in amazing shape. The surfers are lean and strong, with wasp waists, broad shoulders and six packs. Not one of their lot has gotten sick. At the beach entrance is a checkpoint staffed by a surfer with an infrared thermometer to scan all visitors and make sure it stays that way.The club consists of a small warren of shacks, some for sleeping, some for cooking. A dozen or so surfboards lean against a bleached wooden rack. Mr. Benga is the head coach \u2014 he charges $12 for a lesson. He eyed a visitor carefully.\u201cFirst time?\u201d he said.\u201cYep,\u201d the visitor replied.\u201cThis\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, grabbing a seven-foot board.The two trudged across the soft, wet sand and plunged into the waves. The water could not have been cooler than 80 degrees. The swells came in, a clean three-foot-high beach break.In the distance, overlooking the cove, stood a half-finished hotel, yet another casualty of the virus. Bureh Beach was set to hold its first international surfing tournament last fall, expected to attract 1,500 tourists and create 500 jobs. Ebola canceled it.After a few wobbly slip-offs, the visitor caught a wave. There is nothing like the thrill of the shh, shh, shh of the edge of the board knifing through the water, kicking up a fine line of white spray, powered by nature.\u201cHe\u2019s up! He\u2019s up!\u201d Mr. Benga yelled.Afterward, a sumptuous feast appeared from the beachside shacks: barbecued crab, freshly caught fish, hand-sliced French fries and mounds of spiced rice.Mr. Benga beamed with pride as he presented the meal on old, cracked plates. Then he grabbed his board and waded back into the surf. He was not thinking about the canceled tournament, the deserted hotel or the wounds of his country.At that moment, it was all about \u201cdi\u201d waves.Advertisement"}

Today, it is arguably the queen of the social sciences.It wasn\u2019t always this way. Historians held the largest market share until the Great Depression intervened in the 1930s, leading a frightened public to take a greater interest in economics.Today, the profession is so ubiquitous that if you are running a government agency, a think tank, a media outlet or a major corporation, and don\u2019t have your own pet economist on the payroll, you\u2019re the exception.Of course, sociologists, whose comparative advantage is in offering structural explanations, might point to the fact that their field has no equivalent of the business pages, that the president does not receive advice from a Council of Sociological Advisers, and that there\u2019s little demand from Wall Street for sociological insights. Perhaps, although topics like crime, family and faith are grist for the daily newspapers; an array of federal agencies are responsible for dealing with topics like housing, education, labor and human services; and Silicon Valley is hungry for insights from sociologists who study networks.This economist is drawn to conclude that if our relative success is not due to supply, then it must be demand, which means that our popularity reflects the discerning tastes of our audience in the marketplace of ideas.Justin Wolfers is a senior fellow at\nthe Peterson Institute for International\nEconomics and professor of\neconomics and public policy at the\nUniversity of Michigan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Who Nailed 2014 See Volatility This Year", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseVolatility will be the new normal in 2015.That\u2019s the overriding theme that emerged in my annual survey of investment professionals who got it right last year. And if this week\u2019s market action is any indicator, their prediction is already being borne out. Stocks soared on Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining over 300 points, the fourth straight session of triple-digit moves. Interest rates and oil prices have also gyrated.Volatility could also be called the old normal, given how common it was before the relatively tranquil years after the financial crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to get a lot more volatility than we\u2019ve become used to,\u201d said William Miller, who runs the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust. \u201cEvery time we get a correction or even close to it, everybody flips out. I\u2019d say that\u2019s more of an observation than a prediction.\u201dMr. Miller returns for a fourth consecutive appearance in this column on the strength of his forecast for the stock market last year. He was far more bullish than most, and said then that he expected the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to gain \u201cin the low to midteens,\u201d which turned out to be exactly right. (It gained 13.7 percent.)\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot trickier this year,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cBut I\u2019m very bullish on the United States economy over all. I\u2019m looking at high single-digit to low double-digit gains for the S.&P. 500, and I could see the S.&P. 500 gain 15 percent if things break the right way. Absent some weird geopolitical thing, I\u2019d be very surprised to see negative returns.\u201dVolatility was also the forecast, if that\u2019s the right word, at the AlphaSimplex Group in Cambridge, Mass., the research and asset management firm founded by Andrew W. Lo, author of the \u201cadaptive markets hypothesis,\u201d which examined whether markets are rational, and director of M.I.T.\u2019s Laboratory for Financial Engineering. \u201cWe don\u2019t forecast rates or valuations,\u201d said Duncan Wilkinson, the firm\u2019s chief executive. That didn\u2019t stop the firm\u2019s Tactical U.S. Market Fund from posting a 14.7 percent return last year, a full percentage above the S.&P. 500.Its quantitative model accurately assessed that risk remained low. \u201cThere was some turbulence in October, but our model suggested it was only middling, and it wasn\u2019t time to do anything,\u201d said Peter Lee, senior research scientist and co-portfolio manager of the Tactical Market Fund. \u201cThis very disciplined approach has stood us in good stead. It takes the emotion out of investing.\u201dWhether the fund can repeat last year\u2019s success remains to be seen, since it\u2019s little more than a year old. (AlphaSimplex has two other liquid alternative mutual funds with longer track records and just started a global macrofund.) The firm\u2019s model currently shows that risks in the United States market are rising. \u201cWe\u2019re still at 130 percent but we\u2019re close to ratcheting that down,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very carefully for the contagion risk of developed non-U.S. markets.\u201d Whither Bonds? If 2014 was a tough year for active stock managers, it was even worse for fixed-income managers. A year ago, almost everyone expected higher rates, including a bearish Bill Gross, a founder of the investment firm Pimco, who told me then that investors should expect \u201cslim pickings\" and stick to cash or low-yielding money market funds. (It was an especially turbulent year for Mr. Gross, who abruptly left Pimco and joined Janus Capital Group.) His advice for this year is much the same, \u201cBe cautious and content with low positive returns in 2015,\u201d he recently wrote in his monthly newsletter.In what has to be considered the biggest market surprise of 2014, interest rates dropped sharply and bonds rallied. The Barclays United States Aggregate Bond Index returned just under 6 percent. United States Treasuries with longer maturities fared even better.Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management (and a widely followed market analyst), was one of the few to forecast lower rates last year in his annual list of \u201csurprises\u201d for 2015. This year, in what he called \u201cthe polar opposite of what I saw last year,\u201d he\u2019s predicting no less than the \u201cend of the three-decade bull market in bonds,\u201d he told me this week.\u201cRates will go lower at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will shock people, and everyone will throw in the towel on higher rates.\u201d (So far, he seems to be right about that.) But, he said, once people realize that the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus policies are too little, too late, he expects European rates to rise, followed by those in the United States. \u201cYou could see a spike in European rates without any improvement to their economies,\u201d he said. \u201cItalian sovereign debt interest rates are lower than in the United States. That\u2019s insane.\u201dA fund that capitalized on lower rates last year was Delaware Investments\u2019 Extended Duration Bond Fund, which returned over 17 percent. This year, Delaware\u2019s fixed-income specialists are predicting a modest rise in rates, to just over 2 percent for 10-year United States Treasuries. \u201cWe feel the fundamentals suggest rates can stay in the low 2 percent area, and could end up lower because of dislocation in other markets,\u201d said Roger A. Early, Delaware\u2019s co-head of fixed-income investments.He said he was \u201copen-minded\u201d about whether the Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate this year, as nearly everyone expects. \u201cThe market may be surprised that the Fed takes a step back and doesn\u2019t move forward so quickly,\u201d Mr. Early continued. \u201cWe believe United States economic growth is still quite fragile. So current low yields can be sustained for some time.\u201dWhither Oil Prices?In nearly every forecast for the year, the wild card is oil. The steep fall in 2014, from more than $100 a barrel to less than $50, surprised and rattled many investors, stoked fears of deflation and battered emerging market economies, even as it put more cash in consumers\u2019 pockets. Almost no one saw it coming, but one who did is Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of \u201cThe Power Surge: Energy, Opportunity and the Battle for America\u2019s Future.\u201d\u201cEarly in 2014, oil prices had been high and steady for a long time, and people extrapolated that this would be indefinite,\u201d Dr. Levi told me this week as prices fell below $50 a barrel. \u201cThat didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dLooking ahead, \u201cAnything is possible,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cbut all the conditions for high volatility remain in place. That\u2019s the natural state of the oil market unless a cartel is in control. Part of the lesson from last year is that a small mismatch in supply and demand can result in a large and rapid change in prices. That works in both directions. If there\u2019s an increase in global growth, geopolitical disruptions or a faster shutdown in North American production, then oil prices could definitely go up.\u201dNor, he said, should Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential influence be ignored. He noted that the kingdom waited until oil prices got into the $30-a-barrel range before curtailing production in the midst of the financial crisis. \u201cJust because Saudi Arabia hasn\u2019t acted yet doesn\u2019t mean it never will,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First Order of Business for Greece's Winner: Compromise", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe resounding election victory of the leftist party Syriza has pushed Greece closer to quitting the eurozone. But such a departure is still not the most probable outcome, because the party should be able to cut a deal with Greece\u2019s European creditors to avoid default, provided both sides are rational.After all, a large majority of the Greeks want to stay in the eurozine. They rightly fear that quitting it might lead to a downward spiral, in which impoverishment and political strife fuel each other. Meanwhile, no head of government in the other euro countries wants Greece to leave.The good news is that the victory speech by Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, was reasonably conciliatory. The bad news is that Mr. Tsipras has chosen the Independent Greeks, a right-wing antibailout party, as his partner.His priority should be to ask for an extension of the bailout program, which runs out at the end of next month. If he does that, the European Central Bank will continue to provide liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks. That\u2019s important because deposits have been fleeing the banking system in the past week.For their part, the other eurozone countries should agree to extend the program for several months if Mr. Tsipras asks nicely, so that there can be a proper discussion of a new deal. It would not be right to bring the banking system crashing down on a newly elected leader\u2019s head.The other leaders should also accept Mr. Tsipras\u2019s request for a high-level meeting to discuss his plans, rather than force him to deal immediately with the officials from the so-called troika of bailout lenders: the European Commission, the E.C.B. and the International Monetary Fund. The troika will have to be involved eventually, but it would be a red rag to a bull to insist on its being involved prominently from the start, given how hated it is in Greece.Such an approach should, though, be conditional on Mr. Tsipras not doing anything inflammatory before the leaders meet. He should not, for example, try to create a fait accompli by pushing through an increase in the minimum wage and pensions, or rehiring fired civil servants. Such things should be left to the negotiation.It is also important that once in office, Syriza avoid the fiery rhetoric it used during the campaign. Yanis Varoufakis, who is expected to become finance minister, needs to watch his tongue. He was recently quoted by a French newspaper as saying words to the effect that Jean-Claude Trichet, the former head of the E.C.B., would burn in hell. This is not the way to win friends and influence people.Beyond that, there is the making of a deal on the long-term debt. Syriza is now indicating that it will not ask for a haircut but will instead propose linking its debt servicing to the speed with which the Greek economy grows. The European countries, meanwhile, are suggesting they could extend the amount of time Athens has to repay its loans.The snag is that long-term debt relief is not the only issue. The state will run out of cash in March, when a big dollop of I.M.F. money comes due. The best solution would be to let the government sell some more treasury bills to the country\u2019s banks, provided it commits itself to serious negotiations.That will not, however, solve the medium-term liquidity problem that comes to a head in June, when a series of bonds owned by the E.C.B. need to be repaid. It is hard to see how Athens can avoid default then without borrowing more money from the eurozone countries, and they won\u2019t agree to that unless Syriza commits to overhaul the economy and fill a hole in this year\u2019s budget.Syriza has promised to crack down on the oligarchs who have a stranglehold on swaths of the economy, as well as to pursue tax evasion. If Mr. Tsipras shows he means business in this area, he will find some favor with other European leaders. The problem is that he will get their hackles up if he insists on unwinding changes to the labor market \u2014 one of the few areas where there has been good progress in recent years.Equally problematic will be how to close the gap in this year\u2019s budget. The outgoing government wasn\u2019t able to agree with its creditors on this. Syriza will face an even tougher task, because tax receipts dropped off as the election drew near. Mr. Tsipras has been elected on a mandate to increase public spending, not cut it.Yet even here there could be scope for compromise. If Mr. Tsipras shows good will in other areas, the Europeans could make a one-time grant this year to deal with extreme poverty. And, for future years, they could agree that Greece wouldn\u2019t have to run quite such a big budget surplus as currently planned.So there might be a way of cutting a deal. The hitch is that doing so would involve a huge somersault \u2014 what Greeks call a kolotoumba. Many of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s backers would then accuse him of betraying their cause. It is still far from clear whether he is prepared to suffer that.But if the Syriza leader is not prepared to compromise, Greece will default and will have to impose capital controls to stop the banks from collapsing. If the people then forced the government to backtrack, there would be one final chance to stay in the euro. Otherwise, the drachma would beckon.Advertisement"}

He also argued that India had an obligation to curb greenhouse gases despite its economic challenges.\u201cAmerica can be India\u2019s best partner,\u201d he told an audience of 1,500 mostly young Indians at Siri Fort Auditorium before departing the country. \u201cAmerica wants to be your partner as you lift up the lives of the Indian people and provide greater opportunity.\u201dMr. Obama spoke forcefully about India\u2019s responsibility to stop treating women as second-class citizens. \u201cEvery girl\u2019s life matters,\u201d he said, as his wife, Michelle Obama, watched from the audience. \u201cEvery daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. Every woman should be able to go about her day, to walk the street or ride the bus, and be safe and be treated with respect and dignity. She deserves that.\u201dMr. Obama called for religious tolerance in a nation that, like the United States, is home to a wide array of beliefs. \u201cIndia will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith \u2014 so long as it\u2019s not splintered along any lines, and is unified as one nation,\u201d he said.But as he often does, Mr. Obama couched his edged comments with an acknowledgment of American flaws, an effort to avoid seeming as if he were lecturing. He cited his own experiences as an African-American. \u201cEven as America has blessed us with extraordinary opportunities, there were moments in my life where I\u2019ve been treated differently because of the color of my skin,\u201d he said.For many Indian listeners, Mr. Obama\u2019s words on religious diversity were the most important, and the most delicate, part of his speech, said Siddharth Varadarajan, a veteran journalist in India, adding that the president\u2019s warnings \u201cwill not go over well\u201d with leaders in Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party.Although Mr. Modi is said to have discouraged such rhetoric in private, he has so far made no public comment about it, though human rights activists have urged him to do so.President Obama sat with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on Monday.\u201cIn as gentle and as diplomatic way as possible, Obama was drawing attention to something that is really, really important to India,\u201d Mr. Varadarajan said. \u201cIn saying so, he has inadvertently drawn attention to Modi\u2019s silence on the issue.\u201dMr. Obama was careful not to tread on any of Mr. Modi\u2019s sore points, such as by mentioning the 2002 riots, Mr. Varadarajan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the United States is going to take this further,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is too much riding on the commercial side for this to jeopardize anything. But I suppose somewhere down the line, the message goes out that in this globalized world, what you do at home is taken note of by your friends abroad.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not even going to get a chance to give a speech like that there, and he is much closer to them,\u201d Mr. Bhagat told the news channel NDTV. \u201cTo say the prime minister took it really seriously is to go a little too far.\u201d\u201cI know the argument made by some \u2014 that it\u2019s unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly, like India, with soaring energy needs don\u2019t also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don\u2019t stand a chance against climate change.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about a speech by President Obama on the last day of his state visit to India in which he urged the nation to do more to protect human rights and fight climate change misspelled the surname of an Indian author who criticized the speech. He is Chetan Bhagat, not Bhagwat. And because of an editing error, a picture caption with the article misstated the day of the speech in some editions. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dress Is Temporary, the Memories Forever ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesStephanie Grimes Cornman coveted the designer wedding dress she had ogled in fashion spreads. But the price kept it out of reach \u2014 that is, until she embraced the idea that a dress, unlike a spouse, is not to have and to hold forever. Ms. Cornman rented her gown, making it the \u201csomething borrowed\u201d she wore down the aisle for her December wedding.Ms. Cornman, a funeral director from Oklahoma City, searched the approximately 400 dresses listed on Borrowing Magnolia\u2019s site, brands that include Monique Lhuillier, Nicole Miller and Vera Wang. For 14-day rentals, the dresses cost from $375 to $2,000, up to 85 percent off their retail prices.\u00a0(Don\u2019t be late returning them, though. For each day a dress is late, the renter pays 110 percent of the daily rental rate; in Ms. Cornman\u2019s case, that would have been $141.)For $99, she had three dresses mailed to her home; once she decided on the Jenny Packham, that $99 went toward the cost of the rental. The site hemmed the dress for her, per measurements she sent in.Ms. Cornman said that renting the designer gown helped make it possible for her to afford it.\u201cMy husband had called a magazine to find out who made this dress I\u2019d fallen in love with, but then we found out how expensive it was,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so glad to get it for a reasonable price, and I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done with it again, anyway.\u201dTo ensure that gowns like the one Ms. Cornman wore are in good condition, Borrowing Magnolia limits each dress to three rentals annually and five total, according to Ashley Steele, a founder. Sizes range from 0 to 24; alterations are permitted but must be reversible.\u201cMen have been able to rent a tux, from Armani to Versace, for years,\u201d said Jessica Berriman, a founder of Get the Gown, which opened last September and rents out, for an average $1,000 a week, dresses that typically cost $5,000 to $13,000. Among the labels on offer are Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang. Late returns cost $50 a day.Her customers \u201cdon\u2019t want to buy gowns they\u2019re going to wear once,\u201d Ms. Berriman said. \u201cBut they\u2019re still very particular about what they want.\u201dWith such discerning tastes driving them, some rentals may not sound like stand-alone bargains. But several shops emphasized that they catered just as much to trend-consciousness as practicality.One Night Affair carries a mix of bridal fashions, from unlabeled samples to Badgley Mischka and Galia Lahav gowns. The dresses cost from $100 to $1,000 for five days, plus in-house tailoring costs. The shop also rents out custom-made dresses, starting at $299. Sharon Gilchrist opened the store 29 years ago and ran it with her husband, Geoff Gates, until they sold it last fall. It continues to operate under the same name in the Culver City neighborhood of Los Angeles.\u201cRenting wedding gowns was put down back in 1986,\u201d Ms. Gilchrist said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to rent, but that\u2019s changed now.\u201dShe attributed increased interest to the downturn in the economy and, even more, to the Internet, for widely showcasing the latest fashions and easily connecting owners and renters.Besides renting, various options exist for women who aren\u2019t in need of a keepsake, including reselling their dress. Natalie May, married in September, bought an Oscar de la Renta sample runway gown, typically $10,000, its tags still intact, from Nearly Newlywed for $2,850. She paid $850 to have it altered. She is now selling her gown through the site. After the $25 listing fee, $200 cleaning fee and 25 percent commission Nearly Newlywed keeps, she expects to recapture about half of what she paid. \u201cI began to realize how wasteful weddings typically are,\u201d said Ms. May, an architect. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the thought of buying an expensive gown that would be worn once and then sit in my closet for the rest of my life.\u201dHo Seok Seo, who owns Shin Bu, said that while most of his clients are Korean, more Americans from within Los Angeles and beyond are renting from him.Ashley Holm of Los Angeles visited Shin Bu in 2012 in anticipation of her wedding on the shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. \u201cI\u2019m not Korean and I\u2019m not a size 0,\u201d she said, noting how happily surprised she was customizing a lace gown and renting it for about $2,100. \u201cRenting was practical, and I still ended up with the exact dress I wanted.\u201dIn New York, shops like Unique Bridal in Forest Hills, Queens, do the same, fashioning made-to-order gowns for rent, varying in price depending on beadwork and materials.And rentals can extend beyond the dress. Both brick-and-mortar and online boutiques offer a variety of borrowed accouterments, too.\u201cEvery woman is conditioned to pursue the fairy-tale dress and accessories,\u201d said Geoff Gates, a former owner of One Night Affair. \u201cBut you wear it once. Who can afford that?\u201dEven beyond ability to pay, some modern brides see renting as a sensible choice, sparing the stress and space of storing or preserving a gown, and acknowledging that the trends of today may not appeal to future generations.\u201cWhile I love the idea of one day passing on a dress to a daughter or grandchild,\u201d Ms. Holm said, \u201cholding on to a giant dress for the chance that it might get used again seems like a whole lot of hoping. If you have a few beautiful photographs of your dress, what more do you need to remember it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Among the Disrupted", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayAmid the bacchanal of disruption, let us pause to honor the disrupted. The streets of American cities are haunted by the ghosts of bookstores and record stores, which have been destroyed by the greatest thugs in the history of the culture industry. Writers hover between a decent poverty and an indecent one; they are expected to render the fruits of their labors for little and even for nothing, and all the miracles of electronic dissemination somehow do not suffice for compensation, either of the fiscal or the spiritual kind. Everybody talks frantically about media, a second-order subject if ever there was one, as content disappears into \u201ccontent.\u201d What does the understanding of media contribute to the understanding of life? Journalistic institutions slowly transform themselves into silent sweatshops in which words cannot wait for thoughts, and first responses are promoted into best responses, and patience is a professional liability. As the frequency of expression grows, the force of expression diminishes: Digital expectations of alacrity and terseness confer the highest prestige upon the twittering cacophony of one-liners and promotional announcements. It was always the case that all things must pass, but this is ridiculous.Meanwhile the discussion of culture is being steadily absorbed into the discussion of business. There are \u201cmetrics\u201d for phenomena that cannot be metrically measured. Numerical values are assigned to things that cannot be captured by numbers. Economic concepts go rampaging through noneconomic realms: Economists are our experts on happiness! Where wisdom once was, quantification will now be. Quantification is the most overwhelming influence upon the contemporary American understanding of, well, everything. It is enabled by the idolatry of data, which has itself been enabled by the almost unimaginable data-generating capabilities of the new technology. The distinction between knowledge and information is a thing of the past, and there is no greater disgrace than to be a thing of the past. Beyond its impact upon culture, the new technology penetrates even deeper levels of identity and experience, to cognition and to consciousness. Such transformations embolden certain high priests in the church of tech to espouse the doctrine of \u201ctranshumanism\u201d and to suggest, without any recollection of the bankruptcy of utopia, without any consideration of the cost to human dignity, that our computational ability will carry us magnificently beyond our humanity and \u201callow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains. . . . There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine.\u201d (The author of that updated mechanistic nonsense is a director of engineering at Google.)And even as technologism, which is not the same as technology, asserts itself over more and more precincts of human life, so too does scientism, which is not the same as science. The notion that the nonmaterial dimensions of life must be explained in terms of the material dimensions, and that nonscientific understandings must be translated into scientific understandings if they are to qualify as knowledge, is increasingly popular inside and outside the university, where the humanities are disparaged as soft and impractical and insufficiently new. The contrary insistence that the glories of art and thought are not evolutionary adaptations, or that the mind is not the brain, or that love is not just biology\u2019s bait for sex, now amounts to a kind of heresy. So, too, does the view that the strongest defense of the humanities lies not in the appeal to their utility \u2014 that literature majors may find good jobs, that theaters may economically revitalize neighborhoods \u2014 but rather in the appeal to their defiantly nonutilitarian character, so that individuals can know more than how things work, and develop their powers of discernment and judgment, their competence in matters of truth and goodness and beauty, to equip themselves adequately for the choices and the crucibles of private and public life.\u25c6This gloomy inventory of certain tendencies in contemporary American culture \u2014 it is not the whole story, but it is an alarmingly large part of the story \u2014 is offered for the purpose of proposing an accurate name for our moment. We are not becoming transhumanists, obviously. We are too singular for the Singularity. But are we becoming posthumanists?No culture is philosophically monolithic, or promotes a single conception of the human. A culture is an internecine contest between alternative conceptions of the human. Which culture is free of contradictions between first principles? This is no less true of religious cultures than of secular ones, of closed societies than of open ones. Popular culture may be as soaked in ideas as high culture: A worldview can be found in a song. Wherever mortal beings are thoughtful about their mortality, and finite beings ponder their finitude, at whatever level of intellectual articulation, there is philosophy. Philosophy is ubiquitous and inalienable; even the discourse about the end of philosophy is philosophy. A culture may be regarded as the sum of all the philosophies, all the reflective approaches to living, that are manifestly or latently expressed in a society. It is a gorgeous anarchy, even if it contains illusions and errors. There are worse things than being wrong.Greif\u2019s book is a prehistory of our predicament, of our own \u201ccrisis of man.\u201d (The \u201cman\u201d is archaic, the \u201ccrisis\u201d is not.) It recognizes that the intellectual history of modernity may be written in part as the epic tale of a series of rebellions against humanism. Humanism has been savaged by theists and atheists, conservatives and progressives, fascists and socialists, scientists and philosophers, though it has also been propounded by the same diversity of thinkers. Who has not felt superior to humanism? It is the cheapest target of all: Humanism is sentimental, flabby, bourgeois, hypocritical, complacent, middlebrow, liberal, sanctimonious, constricting and often an alibi for power. The abusers of humanism, of course, are guilty of none of those sins. From Heidegger to Althusser, they come as emancipators. I think we should emancipate ourselves from their emancipations.But what is humanism? For a start, humanism is not the antithesis of religion, as Pope Francis is exquisitely demonstrating. The most common understanding of humanism is that it denotes a pedagogy and a worldview. The pedagogy consists in the traditional Western curriculum of literary and philosophical classics, beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and \u2014 after an unfortunate banishment of medieval culture from any pertinence to our own \u2014 erupting in the rediscovery of that antiquity in Europe in the early modern centuries, and in the ideals of personal cultivation by means of textual study and aesthetic experience that it bequeathed, or that were developed under its inspiration, in the \u201cenlightened\u201d 18th and 19th centuries, and eventually culminated in programs of education in the humanities in modern universities. The worldview takes many forms: a philosophical claim about the centrality of humankind to the universe, and about the irreducibility of the human difference to any aspect of our animality; a methodological claim about the most illuminating way to explain history and human affairs, and about the essential inability of the natural sciences to offer a satisfactory explanation; a moral claim about the priority, and the universal nature, of certain values, not least tolerance and compassion. It is all a little inchoate \u2014 \u00adhuman, humane, humanities, humanism, humanitarianism; but there is nothing shameful or demeaning about any of it.And posthumanism? It elects to understand the world in terms of impersonal forces and structures, and to deny the importance, and even the legitimacy, of human agency. It certainly does not mean, as Greif correctly notes about antihumanism, a \u201chatred of the human.\u201d There have been humane posthumanists and there have been inhumane humanists. But the inhumanity of humanists may be refuted on the basis of their own worldview, whereas the condemnation of cruelty toward \u201cman the machine,\u201d to borrow the old but enduring notion of an 18th-century French materialist, requires the importation of another framework of judgment. The same is true about universalism, which every critic of humanism has arraigned for its failure to live up to the promise of a perfect inclusiveness. It is a melancholy fact of history that there has never been a universalism that did not exclude. Yet the same is plainly the case about every particularism, which is nothing but a doctrine of exclusion; and the correction of particularism, the extension of its concept and its care, cannot be accomplished in its own name. It requires an idea from outside, an idea external to itself, a universalistic idea, a humanistic idea. Asking universalism to keep faith with its own principles is a perennial activity of moral life. Asking particularism to keep faith with its own principles is asking for trouble.\u25c6Aside from issues of life and death, there is no more urgent task for American intellectuals and writers than to think critically about the salience, even the tyranny, of technology in individual and collective life. All revolutions exaggerate, and the digital revolution is no different. We are still in the middle of the great transformation, but it is not too early to begin to expose the exaggerations, and to sort out the continuities from the discontinuities. The burden of proof falls on the revolutionaries, and their success in the marketplace is not sufficient proof. Presumptions of obsolescence, which are often nothing more than the marketing techniques of corporate behemoths, need to be scrupulously examined. By now we are familiar enough with the magnitude of the changes in all the spheres of our existence to move beyond the futuristic rhapsodies that characterize much of the literature on the subject. We can no longer roll over and celebrate and shop. Every phone in every pocket contains a \u201cpicture of ourselves,\u201d and we must ascertain what that picture is and whether we should wish to resist it. Here is a humanist proposition for the age of Google: The processing of information is not the highest aim to which the human spirit can aspire, and neither is competitiveness in a global economy. The character of our society cannot be determined by engineers.\u201cOur very mastery seems to escape our mastery,\u201d Michel Serres has anxiously remarked. \u201cHow can we dominate our domination; how can we master our own mastery?\u201d Every technology is used before it is completely understood. There is always a lag between an innovation and the apprehension of its consequences. We are living in that lag, and it is a right time to keep our heads and reflect. We have much to gain and much to lose. In the media, for example, the general inebriation about the multiplicity of platforms has distracted many people from the scruple that questions of quality on the new platforms should be no different from questions of quality on the old platforms. Otherwise a quantitative expansion will result in a qualitative contraction. The new devices do not in themselves authorize a revision of the standards of evidence and argument and style that we championed in the old devices. (What a voluptuous device paper is!) Such revisions may be made on other grounds \u2014 out of commercial ambition, for example; but there is nothing innovative about pandering for the sake of a profit. The decision to prefer the requirements of commerce to the requirements of culture cannot be exonerated by the thrills of the digital revolution.Is all this \u2014 is humanism \u2014 sentimental? But sentimentality is not always a counterfeit emotion. Sometimes sentiment is warranted by reality. The persistence of humanism through the centuries, in the face of formidable intellectual and social obstacles, has been owed to the truth of its representations of our complexly beating hearts, and to the guidance that it has offered, in its variegated and conflicting versions, for a soulful and sensitive existence. There is nothing soft about the quest for a significant life. And a complacent humanist is a humanist who has not read his books closely, since they teach disquiet and difficulty. In a society rife with theories and practices that flatten and shrink and chill the human subject, the humanist is the dissenter. Never mind the platforms. Our solemn responsibility is for the substance.LEON WIESELTIER is a contributing editor at The Atlantic and the author of \u201cKaddish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France, the Crucible of Europe", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE France that endured a vicious terrorist attack last week is a France that has suffered, for decades and centuries, from anxieties about its own decline. And for good reason: Since the 18th century, when it bestrode Europe and seemed poised to dominate the globe, France has seen its relative power diminish, suffering defeats and humiliations at the hands of rival forces, from Britain\u2019s navies to Germany\u2019s jackboots to the invading might of American popular culture.Now these longstanding anxieties have been thrown into relief by the murderous attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, an attack linked to all the various specters haunting contemporary France: fears of creeping Islamification and rising anti-Semitism, fears of the far right\u2019s growing power and anti-Muslim backlash \u2014 and all of it bound up in a larger sense, amid economic stagnation, of betrayal at the hands of the Continent\u2019s elite.But notwithstanding these declinist fears, France isn\u2019t actually irrelevant or spent. Instead, it\u2019s arguably becoming more important, more central to the fate of Europe and the West.No, the age of the Sun King isn\u2019t about to return. But politically, culturally, even intellectually, events in France over the next half-century could matter more than at any point since before the two world wars. Indeed, more than Germany or Greece or Britain or any other actor, it\u2019s in France that the fate of 21st-century Europe could ultimately be decided.Consider the specific issue at the heart of the Hebdo nightmare: the question of whether European nation-states can successfully integrate Muslim immigrants, and what will happen if they don\u2019t. So if there\u2019s a path to greater Muslim assimilation and inclusion, it\u2019s more likely to be pioneered in France. If Islamic radicalism is going to gain ground or mutate into something more pervasive and dangerous, it\u2019s also more likely to happen in France\u2019s sphere of influence than elsewhere. And if Europe\u2019s much-feared far right is going to complete its journey from the fringe to the mainstream, it will probably happen first in Paris.Then amid these political and economic patterns there\u2019s an important intellectual possibility \u2014 namely, that if there\u2019s something beyond the West\u2019s current end-of-history torpor, some new ideological conflict or synthesis, it might emerge first in the place where so many revolutions had their birth.The decline has been real, but the future is unwritten. If there is real history yet to be made in Europe, for good or ill, it might be made first in la belle France.In 2015, Thomas L. Friedman will be writing only on Wednesdays while he works on a book.

{"Headline": "Pick Me! Four American Cities Put Best Olympic Foot Forward", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States Olympic Committee seems ready to bid for the 2024 Summer Games. But the hard part is deciding which of the four finalists \u2014 Boston, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 has the best chance of being chosen by the International Olympic Committee. The U.S.O.C. could make its selection as soon as this week, so we asked New York Times reporters in each city to describe the view from each place.Some people laughed, some were defensive. But few disputed that Boston is wrapped up in an existential debate with itself about whether it is a \u201cworld-class\u201d city.Despite its many obvious assets \u2014 world-renowned universities, top-flight medical centers, a thriving biotech-driven innovation economy and championship sports teams, not to mention Tom Brady and David Ortiz \u2014 Boston still has an inferiority complex. And as it makes its first serious bid to host the Olympics, it shows.Some seem to think that being picked to put on the 2024 Summer Games is entwined with mythic world-class status.To Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, an initial skeptic of the bid, hosting the Olympics \u201cputs us on a scale not too many cities can claim.\u201dWhether winning an Olympics confers world-class status, Boston\u2019s bid contains an inherent paradox: Its dream to make it big is not that big.Boston\u2019s modest $4.5 billion proposal envisions a new Olympic model: a walkable, bikeable, sustainable Games that uses mostly pre-existing structures. This compact city of 646,000 plans a downsized, compressed, antisprawl Olympics. No venue would be more than a 10-minute walk from a subway stop or a commuter rail line.The International Olympic Committee has been forced to encourage this kind of thinking. Interest in hosting has declined as potential hosts watched costs spiral out of control for recent Games in Beijing ($40 billion) and Sochi, Russia ($50 billion).Still, one might wonder if Boston\u2019s proposal was actually made by The Onion: The athletes could live in college dormitories that are empty during the summer; the modular housing of an Olympic village could later become new dorms; and a proposed $700 million Olympic Stadium would be temporary, so it could be razed or relocated.Does anyone think this might be carrying Yankee frugality too far? And are Olympic bigwigs serious about not wanting an extravaganza?Have you been to Boston? It\u2019s boring.Sorry, Washington: No nation wants to send athletes to the home of the National Security Agency.That leaves Los Angeles with one actual competitor, San Francisco. It\u2019s up to you, International Olympic Committee, but the population of that peninsula city \u2014 already terribly full of its Apple-Google-Uber self \u2014 would very likely burst into a fireball of smugness if it was also given the 2024 Olympics. Think it over.Los Angeles, on the other hand, is the perfect choice.The Chinese will be running Hollywood by then (except for North Korea\u2019s Democratic Republic of Sony Pictures), so their athletes will feel right at home. To save on housing costs, David Geffen can offer to host the men\u2019s gymnastics team at his mansion. And also the men\u2019s water polo team.Beach volleyball? Hello.True, there will be no water for the aquatic center. Perhaps the pools could be filled with San Pellegrino. Or perhaps the divers could simply be trained to land in one of those itty-bitty washtubs, the way they used to at the circus. We\u2019ll work it out.Imagine the opening ceremony Los Angeles could put together: Meryl Streep riding sidesaddle on a dolphin. Magic Johnson and Mama Kardashian carrying the torch. Fireworks sponsored by \u201cStar Wars: Episode Ad Nauseam: Does It Really Matter What We Subtitle These Anymore, Part 1.\u201dLook, there are pros and cons for every potential host city. Pro: Los Angeles would become more health-conscious than it already is. Con: Los Angeles would become more health-conscious than it already is.But the City of Angels, really and truly, is a terrific choice. Get under the hood, beyond its silly celebrity facade, and you will see how serious a contender it is:Los Angeles is bigger than Boston, Washington and San Francisco combined. More than 30 countries have their second largest population in Los Angeles, a region of roughly 19 million people, giving a home-field advantage to more than Americans.Naysayers will bray that Los Angeles has hosted the Summer Games, twice. True, and that experience could be critical. Besides, London has been an Olympic city three times, so get over it.Among subway construction, road improvements and a desperately needed modernization of the Los Angeles International Airport, $40 billion worth of infrastructure enhancements are underway.Unlike other cities that hide their goodies far from the airport, the glories of your nation\u2019s capital are breathtakingly beneath you in your final approach. There is Arlington National Cemetery! Hello, Jefferson Memorial! Wow, I can practically touch the Washington Monument from my seat! (Fun game: Listen to a passenger near you describe with great authority and total inaccuracy what they see. My personal favorite was the guy who called the United States Capitol a memorial to George Washington.)The thrills may ebb once you try to exit the airport.A lack of proper signage, the absence of left-turn lanes, terrifying traffic circles for which the right of way seems to go to the fastest driver and an unpredictable public transit system can vex the visitor.But, hey, you\u2019re here to watch sports. The city recently approved the construction of a new soccer stadium, which would keep company with our lovely home to baseball\u2019s Nationals, right in the heart of the city, as well as FedEx Field, Verizon Center, the Armory and various University of Maryland venues. At last, R.F.K. Stadium, which is, politely, an embarrassingly decrepit pit, would almost certainly be renovated, or, better yet, demolished, with a glorious new Olympic stadium in its place. So stadiums: We\u2019ve got it more or less covered.You will hear bad things about our summer weather. It\u2019s true. But there is an upside: In late summer, locals empty the place out, which means plenty of housing will be available. (Anyone want first dibs on a well-situated house in the northwest quadrant? It currently comes with an 11-year-old who can walk you through the cable system and a teenager who will block you on Twitter.)Amid the obligatory debates of what will become of an Olympic village in a town in desperate need of affordable housing once revelers hit the road, we tend to keep the focus on tourists. The two-for-one thrills of monuments, free Smithsonian museums and the maligned but majestic center of government rival all the other cities for non-Olympic recreation.Secretly, and somewhat smugly, San Franciscans love that so many other people love their city. They see their home as one of the most beautiful and interesting cities in the world, too. Validation is nice.But with all due respect, many in San Francisco would rather you do your fawning from a distance. Traffic is bad enough without the double-decker tourist buses blocking the view atop Lombard Street or clogging the Golden Gate Bridge.So it is with some reluctance that the following suggestion is made: San Francisco would be quite a sensible place to hold the Summer Olympics.The Bay Area\u2019s bid can promise cool summer weather (with virtually no rain), a decent mass-transit system (not cable cars) and a collection of well-suited venues spread (but not too far) across the landscape.San Francisco has its cultural critics, but it would show the world a United States that is environmentally friendly, diverse in many ways and technologically advanced. And if we in the Bay Area were the type to brag, we would add that the scenery is incredible.But the key lies in the venues. In these post-Athens and Beijing days, no one wants to spend money on new ones, and San Francisco is not looking to use the Olympics as a means to a bigger, urban-renewal end.There are lots of colleges and two major universities (Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley) with huge stadiums, arenas and dormitories. There are plenty of places to house athletes and hold smaller events.Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara is hosting the Super Bowl in 2016. A planned waterfront basketball arena for the Warriors should open in a few years. A Major League Soccer stadium is being built in San Jose. If baseball and softball return to the Olympic docket, well, there are plenty of places to play those, too, including two Major League Baseball stadiums.San Francisco organizers are not quite sure where to put track and field and the opening and closing ceremonies. One idea is to build a temporary stadium south of shuttered Candlestick Park. That sounds like something Athens would do.Until that is figured out, imagine sailing between the Golden Gate and Bay bridges in San Francisco Bay; the same course that was perfect for the summer-long America\u2019s Cup in 2013 is good enough for a couple weeks of Olympics.Picture a hilly marathon tracing up the crooked block of Lombard Street. Or mountain biking in Marin County, the birthplace of the sport. Or the triathlon off Alcatraz, beach volleyball at City Hall, rowing in McCovey Cove. And if the Olympics still insist on golf, there is the Olympic Club or Pebble Beach.Supporters of Boston, Washington, Los Angeles might combat their disadvantages with snarky comparisons about summers in San Francisco and the coldest winters. Summer is fog season, and daytime temperatures in patches of the city can get stuck in the 50s. That is why armies of entrepreneurs sell cheap San Francisco jackets and sweatshirts to tourists who expected a July trip to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf would include sunshine and warmth.But thanks to the Bay Area\u2019s uniquely micro microclimates, temperatures predictably fluctuate 20 degrees or more in 20 miles or less. So while the sailing competition off Crissy Field could be shrouded by chilly fog, a soccer game at Stanford Stadium might be played in 80-degree sunshine. Athletes will love that they are not in the heat and humidity of, say, Boston.And you know what almost never happens in the summer in the Bay Area? Rain.Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Nations Face Stronger Pressures to Lift Economies", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 As the European Central Bank deploys its most powerful economic weapon, the onus for growth now lies with the 19 individual countries in the euro currency union, a fractious and highly political group.The central bank\u2019s plan calls for buying 60 billion euros, or about $69 billion, of government bonds and other debt each month. It is the kind of aggressive action that leaders in weaker eurozone countries have long wanted and that Germany has tried to block.Syriza, the leftist party expected to win the Greek elections this weekend, on Thursday called the bond purchase program \u201can important decision which the next Greek government will use for the benefit of the country.\u201dThe central bank, though, is stretching the limits of its power with the bond-buying program. And if it is not enough to address what ails Europe, any further stimulus efforts would fall to national leaders. Such steps would involve the sort of extensive government spending that many countries, particularly Germany, have been reluctant to pursue, hewing instead to a philosophy of budget discipline known as austerity. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Thursday warned her peers not to waste the breathing space given by the central bank\u2019s stimulus. \u201cWe should not become diverted from the fact that we as politicians need to put a framework for recovery in place,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at the World Economic Forum here in Davos, minutes before the European Central Bank announced its decision in Frankfurt.The central bank\u2019s plan, in part, is aimed at easing the burden on national governments by pumping at least \u20ac1.1 trillion into the system. The increased demand from the European Central Bank should raise bond prices and push down yields. If the tactic, known as quantitative easing, works, it would ripple through financial markets, pulling down the interest rates on other types of debt, like business loans. As a further stimulus step, the European Central Bank said on Thursday that it was cutting the interest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks, as long as the banks commit to lending that money to companies or individuals. The new rate would be 0.05 percent, down from 0.15 percent.The increased borrowing should help drive inflation and growth in individual countries. The plan could also give governments a share of any profit the European Central Bank might make in interest or in reselling the bonds later.Even if the central bank action does not reach Italian or Portuguese borrowers, it could still help.Mario Moretti Polegato, president of the Italian shoemaker Geox, said quantitative easing could help restore a sense of optimism. Many smaller Italian companies could get credit if they wanted it, he said, but they are too pessimistic about their business prospects to invest.\u201cThe E.C.B. move is not something that will replace what Italy needs to do,\u201d Mr. Polegato said in an interview at Davos. But he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a first step.\u201dAny relief that national leaders feel might be clouded by the realization that there is probably not much more the European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi, can do to stimulate the region\u2019s economy.On Thursday, Mr. Draghi once again emphasized that national governments need to step up their efforts to rekindle growth. \u201cIt is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area, but will also raise expectation of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward economic recovery,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in a statement. \u201cFiscal policies should support the economic recovery.\u201d Quantitative easing programs have helped revive the economies of the United States and Britain. But the eurozone is not a single country. It is largely a matter of conjecture whether pushing down the interest rates on government debt and some other kinds of bonds in Spain, for example, would make it easier for a hard-pressed small business owner in Italy to get a loan.\u201cThe way it\u2019s transmitted is the key,\u201d Anat R. Admati, a professor of economics at Stanford University, said in an interview in Davos. Central banks \u201cdon\u2019t control what happens after they give the money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make money cheaper and hope it finds its way to the real economy.\u201dLawrence H. Summers, a professor at Harvard University and former Treasury secretary, said during a Davos panel discussion that it was \u201ca mistake to suppose that Q.E. is a panacea in Europe, or that it will be sufficient.\u201dIn a compromise intended to appease Germans fearful that they will pick up the bill if other countries do not pay their debts, the European Central Bank will delegate some of the bond buying to national central banks, which will also assume some of the risk. Analysts said that leaving some risk with individual countries could weaken the credibility of the program.Anticipating the criticism, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cThe singleness of monetary policy remains in place.\u201dThe European Central Bank has sometimes seemed like the sole eurozone institution seeking to restore the economy, in the absence of government spending stimulus. Eurozone leaders may now feel more pressure to act. But most of the changes that economists say are needed, such as loosening rules that make it hard for companies to fire unwanted workers, are unpopular with voters.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult task,\u201d Sigmar Gabriel, the German economics minister, said of making economic reforms during a panel discussion. \u201cMost governments that have gone through with it have lost the next elections. But there is no alternative.\u201dReporting was contributed by David Jolly from Frankfurt, Niki Kitsantonis from Athens, and Jenny Anderson, Peter Eavis and Alison Smale from Davos, Switzerland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nativist Lawsuit on the Texas Border", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe judge held the first hearing in the case on Thursday and could rule as early as next month. If he blocks Mr. Obama\u2019s actions \u2014 which seek to protect millions of immigrants from deportation and to grant them permission to work \u2014 this would complicate things for the administration, which is planning to start signing people up for the programs in February.So things will likely be O.K., but they may get bumpy in the meantime.Potential applicants for deportation relief and their families need to hold firm and not let themselves be confused or bullied into not coming forward. The success of the Obama programs, one of the most positive developments on immigration reform in years, will depend on wide participation. The Obama administration has an urgent job this year: setting up an ambitious, smoothly functioning effort that could grant relief to more than four million people. All the anti-immigrant side has to do is keep trying to block reform, and, failing that, to spread chaos, confusion and anxiety.The country is not going to deport everybody \u2014 even many Republicans admit that, but they continue to refuse to do anything to fix the system. After Mitt Romney\u2019s disastrous presidential pose on \u201cself-deportation,\u201d the party went through a stretch of sobriety and sought to enhance its damaged brand by getting in line with the public, which rejects mass deportation in favor of having immigrants come forward, pay taxes and get right with the law. But now we have Republican governors and attorneys general pressing a 25-state lawsuit, joining their counterparts in Congress who are waging a legislative assault on Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions. The party has reverted back to its original strategy: intimidation, exclusion and fear. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Agonized Cry to Europe", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt is too soon to anticipate how Alexis Tsipras, the maverick politician whose left-wing Syriza party won 36.3 percent of the popular vote and nearly gained an outright majority in Parliament, intends to deliver on the promises he made to voters to abandon the austerity program while reducing the nation\u2019s debt and retaining the euro. These goals are fundamentally incompatible, but the new prime minister has signaled to Europeans that he is ready to moderate his ambitions once in office. It is essential that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seen by Greeks as the prime architect of the austerity program, and the \u201ctroika\u201d of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which manage the Greek bailout, demonstrate a similar readiness to ease the size and conditions of Greece\u2019s debt burden.Some of the creditors still seem to feel that a debt is a debt to be repaid in full, and that the Greeks \u201cdeserve\u201d punishment for their history of profligate spending and habitual tax evasion. But shrinking an economy by a quarter and throwing more than half the young people out of work \u2014 policies Mr. Tsipras has likened to waterboarding \u2014 is not the way to enable a country to pay back its debts. Greece needs some breathing room, not only to give Mr. Tsipras a chance to turn the country around but also for the sake of the rest of Europe.Greece may be exceptional in the size of its debt burden, now about 177 percent of G.D.P., and its systemic problems run deep. But Greeks are not unique in their feelings of alienation and anger over the economic crisis that spread to many of the poorer countries of the European Union, and Syriza is hardly the most radical of the fringe parties that have arisen across Europe in reaction to the crisis. If Greece is pushed to the limit and compelled to default on its debt payments, and even to abandon the euro, the economic repercussions would spread through all Europe. Politically, a \u201cGrexit\u201d \u2014 Greek exit from the euro \u2014 would shatter the assumption that there is no retreat from the euro and further destabilize Europe. And it would certainly add fuel to anti-European Union sentiments that have propelled the growth of far-right parties.There is not a lot of time, though. Greece\u2019s current bailout program expires on Feb. 28. European Union leaders \u2014 Mr. Tsipras among them \u2014 are scheduled to gather in Brussels on Feb. 12. An announcement there of an extension of the program for several months would be a good signal that the Europeans have heard the cry of the Greeks and are prepared to be more sensible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tempering a Worldview With Freedom and Fairness", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyHow is it possible to construct a free-market economy that is also fair? That should be the central question for this year\u2019s annual gathering of the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Free enterprise and globalization, the cornerstones of the Davos worldview, have delivered many benefits over the decades. But since the global financial crisis, the goodies have been few and far between in developed Western economies. Much of Europe has been mired in recession. Unemployment, especially among the young, is rife.Even in better-performing economies like the United States\u2019, the middle classes have experienced stagnant living standards. The fruits of economic growth, such as it is, have been gobbled up mainly by the elite.Hence, the growing inequalities across almost every society that have been extensively documented by the French economist Thomas Piketty.So it should be no surprise that the Davos worldview is under assault. One manifestation is the continuous attacks on the banking industry. But the backlash has gone far beyond finance.It is most visible in the rise of populist political parties across Europe. Their instincts vary, depending on whether they are coming from the left or the right, but they often wish to stop immigration and control free trade. And many want to write off debts or increase public spending \u2014 or do both.A response to the inequality backlash might be to try reasserting free-market values. One could point out that bankruptcy will lead to disruption and even more joblessness. One could argue that protectionism will impoverish countries. One could stress that immigration often enriches the recipient countries, as it is mostly hard-working youngsters who venture abroad. One could even say that globalization has helped hundreds of millions of people escape poverty in developing countries.All this would be true. But it misses the point that the average person in most Western countries hasn\u2019t been doing well, either. Such a situation is probably unsustainable. Most people think it isn\u2019t fair either.The challenge is to devise a modern social market approach to the economy that celebrates freedom and enterprise while also being fair.What, though, is fairness? After all, every political philosopher has a different conception. But any reasonable definition should have at least three elements.The first is that a society should help all its citizens get a decent crack at building a good life. This is not the same as ensuring that they end up with such a life. Governments cannot do this, and, even if they could, it would be wrong to take over people\u2019s lives in this way. There has to be room for individuality, effort, enterprise, creativity and failure.Helping people get a decent crack at building a good life isn\u2019t even as strong a condition as \u201cequal opportunity.\u201d Equality is an impractical objective \u2014 and would run into objections from people who want to give the best they can to their own children. A society has to allow scope for that.Fairness does, however, mean helping the young get a good education and a good start in the job market \u2014 something that many do not get. Only then will they have the tools to thrive in an increasingly competitive world.The second element of such a conception of fairness is that the economy should not be distorted in favor of particular segments of society. This typically means sweeping away monopolies, privileges and restrictive practices.The two most popular targets are politicians and bankers. In much of the world, politicians are considered corrupt. Meanwhile, financiers are hated because they kept their profits in the good times but taxpayers ended up covering many of the losses.The final element of fairness would be a tax-and-benefit system under which those with the broadest shoulders carry the heaviest burden and those in the greatest need receive help.The least contentious aspect of this is to crack down on tax evasion and to close loopholes that allow multinational companies to pay little tax. There is also a strong case for using benefits to support workers with low incomes. That distorts the market less than ramping up minimum wages, a policy that can inadvertently increase unemployment.Some left-wingers also want bigger taxes on wealth, and high tax rates for top earners. The snag is that, beyond a certain level, such taxes undermine enterprise and \u2014 as a result \u2014 jobs. Hefty taxes also give the wealthy a strong incentive to engage in elaborate schemes to hide their money and move it offshore.On the other hand, it would be seem reasonable to put income tax rates and capital gains taxes on more equal footing. Capital gains \u2014 the profit on stocks, real estate and other assets \u2014 tend to be enjoyed by the wealthiest people, but are often more lightly taxed than income.There is also scope in some countries for higher property taxes. The great advantage of such taxes is that people can\u2019t hide property or move it offshore.In Britain, there is a further reason for overhauling property tax. The current \u201ccouncil tax\u201d system is highly regressive, with low-income people paying a disproportionate share of their income compared with the wealthy. Even if one does not want to impose punitive rates on particularly expensive homes, which is the opposition Labour Party\u2019s plan, the tax should at least be proportionate to the value of the property.Such measures would not please most of the Davos crowd. But the people wining, dining and opining this week at the World Economic Forum should look to their enlightened self-interest. Unless enterprise can be made fair as well as free, there is a risk that what is good about the Davos worldview will be swept away with the bad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria\u2019s Army of Psychopaths", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Here in Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub, it is tempting to regard Boko Haram, the Islamist terrorist group that for more than five years has waged war in the country\u2019s far northeast, as a distant tragedy. We are, of course, aware of the fallout: the thousands of deaths, the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, the destroyed infrastructure \u2014 schools, churches, mosques, homes, police stations \u2014 that will take years, and millions of dollars, to rebuild. But in southern Nigeria, it is easy to feel removed from the crisis.The reality, though, is that the insurgency\u2019s impact ripples out across the country. A visit last year to a popular fabric market in Abeokuta, a city about 60 miles north of Lagos, brought this home to me.I was there to interview the merchants about their work. When we talked about the challenges they faced, I expected the usual: electricity, taxation, access to credit. So I was surprised when one woman mentioned Boko Haram. A number of her customers lived in northern Nigeria and had stopped placing orders since the insurgency began.The trade links between north and south are even more apparent in agriculture. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food comes from the troubled region. Potiskum, a city that the jihadist militants have attacked on several occasions in recent years, killing dozens, is one of the largest cattle markets in West Africa. Chibok, the village from which hundreds of girls were abducted last April, is a village of farmers, growing grain that goes to market across the country.I spoke with the father of one of the missing girls last year, a few months after the abductions. Like many farmers in the area, he was too scared to go out in the fields to plant anything, and the season was almost over. Not only would he be unable to feed his remaining family, but there would also be nothing to sell.For Nigerians, the economy is an ever-present concern: The country often seems at the mercy of cyclical oil prices, currency devaluations and budget deficits. But Boko Haram\u2019s campaign of terror has emerged as the single most important issue facing Nigeria.What is unfamiliar and hard to adjust to is the sort of threat to the nation that Boko Haram represents. Nigeria is no stranger to instability: Our history is rife with communal clashes and civil unrest, with casualty figures unimaginable in America. In the late 1960s, the country was torn apart by a civil war over the secession of the Biafra region that resulted in the deaths of more than a million people.But no crisis in recent history has matched that created by the insurgency in the north. The cumulative death toll now exceeds 11,000. Boko Haram\u2019s stated aim is to create an Islamic caliphate, but it shows little impulse toward establishing its legitimacy as an alternative government. The reports of a massacre this month in Baga, and satellite images of wholesale destruction in nearby Doro Gowon, affirm the fact that Nigeria is facing an army of psychopaths masquerading as Islamic proselytizers \u2014 and the only reasonable response should be military force.Instead, the government keeps stumbling from one disaster to another, leaving most of us mystified about why the insurgency has been so horribly mishandled. After the Chibok girls were kidnapped, it took President Goodluck Jonathan three weeks to address the nation, and months went by before he met with their families.The international community, too, has grown impatient. The United States government has refused to sell arms to Nigeria, not trusting either the competence or human rights record of the military. When a Nigerian plane, laden with $9.3 million in cash, was detained in South Africa last September, the government was forced to admit that it was trying to purchase weapons on the black market. Soon after, a triumphant declaration of a cease-fire with Boko Haram turned out to be a hoax; senior government officials had been hoodwinked.The fiascos continue. The Baga massacre was greeted with silence from the president, while the military played down the number of casualties. Instead, Mr. Jonathan condemned the terrorist attacks in Paris, and we were treated to media photos of the wedding of the president\u2019s niece, which took place on the weekend the news about Baga broke.With about a month to go until the general election, such missteps have come to define Mr. Jonathan\u2019s government. The opposition has accused him of corruption, pointing to the country\u2019s ballooning (but seemingly ineffective) security budget.At an election rally in southwestern Nigeria earlier this month, I heard an opposition politician tell the crowd that the only way to ensure the safety of their children was to vote for Muhammadu Buhari. General Buhari, a 72-year-old retired army officer who ruled Nigeria 30 years ago, is the best placed to win of the candidates challenging Mr. Jonathan.His All Progressives Congress party promotes an ambitious program to create jobs, tackle corruption, provide free education and health care, and invest in infrastructure, but its plans have been short on detail. Yet, for many, the desire for change is stronger than the doubts about a civilian Buhari presidency.In his campaigning, Mr. Jonathan vigorously rebuts the idea that he has underperformed or is too tolerant of corruption. But he has mostly avoided mentioning Boko Haram. Perhaps he has realized that by now his cache of platitudes \u2014 \u201cTerrorism is a global problem,\u201d \u201cNigeria is not alone in dealing with it,\u201d \u201cNigeria will triumph\u201d \u2014 sound hollow in a stump speech.Nigerians need to take the decisive action that their president has failed to offer. My hope is that on Valentine\u2019s Day, when the election takes place, Nigerians will remember the missing girls of Chibok, and the dead residents of Baga and the refugees of the north, and vote out a man who has demonstrated, beyond doubt, that he cannot inspire confidence as a commander in chief.Advertisement"}

Bush administration. \u201cIt puts the ball fully in his court.\u201dAs debate on the Keystone bill began on the House floor just hours after the court\u2019s decision, Speaker John A. Boehner said Mr. Obama had to act. \u201cFinally, it\u2019s time to start building,\u201d he said.Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said, \u201cRegardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the president and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests.\u201dBut the Nebraska decision puts more pressure on the president to use that authority. Although the State Department has the official authority to permit the project because it would cross an international border, it has become clear that the final decision rests with Mr. Obama as the project has grown into a political fight.\u201cToday\u2019s court decision wipes out President Obama\u2019s last excuse,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s had six years to approve a project that will increase U.S. energy supplies and create closer ties with our nearest ally and neighbor, and he\u2019s refused to act. Regardless of whatever new excuse he may come up with, Congress is moving forward.\u201dGov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska had approved the Keystone project after the pipeline company, TransCanada, proposed a route that avoided the state\u2019s ecologically delicate Sandhills region. The Nebraska justices, in their decision, effectively overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that had blocked a state law giving the governor the right to approve the project.That law, passed in 2012, let oil pipeline companies take their projects directly to the governor, bypassing the Nebraska Public Service Commission.In February, however, a state district judge ruled that the 2012 law was unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed to the seven-member State Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in September.Friday\u2019s decision turned on an unusual provision of the Nebraska Constitution, which says that \u201cno legislative act shall be held unconstitutional except by the concurrence of five judges.\u201d Four justices, making up a majority of the court, voted to hold the law unconstitutional, while the other three said only that the plaintiffs had not suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue.\u201cBecause there are not five judges of this court voting on the constitutionality\u201d of the law, Justice William M. Connolly wrote for the majority, \u201cthe legislation must stand by default.\u201dA bipartisan coalition of environmental advocates, ranchers and farmers has argued for years that the project poses unacceptable risks to Nebraska\u2019s groundwater and agricultural land because of the potential for oil spills.In a 2013 speech, Mr. Obama said that the pipeline\u2019s potential impact on climate change would be a key factor in his decision. Last January, the State Department review seemed to give the president the cover to approve the pipeline by concluding that it would not significantly increase the rate of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. The State Department\u2019s rationale was that the oil was already moving to market by rail and other pipelines, and that it would be extracted with or without construction of the pipeline.But appearing in December on the television show \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d Mr. Obama spoke negatively of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that it\u2019s not adding to the problem of carbon and climate change,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe have to examine that, and we have to weigh that against the amount of jobs that it\u2019s actually going to create, which aren\u2019t a lot.\u201dThe president added: \u201cEssentially, this is Canadian oil passing through the United States to be sold on the world market. It\u2019s not going to push down gas prices here in the United States. It\u2019s good for Canada.\u201dThe State Department review estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs over its two-year construction period \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest in indirect support jobs, such as food service. The department estimated that the project would create about 35 permanent jobs.The report also estimated that building the pipeline would contribute about $3.4 billion to the American economy.On Saturday afternoon, environmental activists plan to demonstrate outside the White House, calling on Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline.\u00a0Coral Davenport reported from Washington, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Web Freedom Is Seen as a Growing Global Issue", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Government censorship of the Internet is a cat-and-mouse game. And despite more aggressive tactics in recent months, the cats have been largely frustrated while the mice wriggle away.But this year, the challenges for Silicon Valley will mount, with Russia and Turkey in particular trying to tighten controls on foreign-based Internet companies. Major American companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google are increasingly being put in the tricky position of figuring out which laws and orders to comply with around the world \u2014 and which to ignore or contest.On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, signed the latest version of a personal data law that will require companies to store data about Russian users on computers inside the country, where it will be easier for the government to get access to it. With few companies expected to comply with the law, which goes into effect Sept. 1, a confrontation may well erupt.Anton Nosik, a prominent Russian blogger whose work has been censored by regulators, said it was absurd for a government to think it could easily stamp out an article or video when it can be copied or found elsewhere with a few clicks. \u201cThe reader wants to see what he was prevented from seeing,\u201d Mr. Nosik said in an interview. \u201cAll that blocking doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cWe all became hackers,\u201d Asli Tunc, a professor of communication at Istanbul Bilgi University, said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd we all got on Twitter.\u201dDespite such victories for free-speech advocates, governments around the world are stepping up their efforts to control the Internet, escalating the confrontation.\u201cThe trendlines are consistent,\u201d Colin Crowell, Twitter\u2019s global vice president of public policy, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere are more and more requests for removal of information.\u201dFree-speech activists view Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network with 1.35 billion monthly users, as the company most inclined to work with governments and do whatever is necessary to keep its service up and running.Last spring, while Twitter was blocked in Turkey and YouTube was shut down, Facebook removed contested content and continued to operate. It has a dedicated team of outside lawyers who field censorship requests from the Turkish government and then recommend to corporate officials whether content should be blocked.\u201cFacebook can be quite important to the people who use it, so we try to make sure it remains accessible,\u201d a company spokesman said. \u201cWe aggressively push back on unlawful or overly broad government requests.\u201dTwitter, which has about 284 million monthly users, styles itself as the world\u2019s town square and a global champion of free speech, conforming to the letter of censorship laws while winking at workaround strategies, like users changing the location listed on their profile to evade specific blocks that apply in a particular country.For Turkey\u2019s opposition movement, Professor Tunc said, Twitter \u201cbasically created an opening, a refreshing alternative, especially during the protests. And they know that. They act like a defender of freedom.\u201dAs the biggest player, Google, whose YouTube service seems to draw the particular ire of foreign governments, has been forced into fights on many fronts. It is still viewed by many as a hero for its decision to pull out of China in 2010 rather than continue to censor search results there.While China remains a thorn in the side of most Western Internet companies \u2014 Facebook and Twitter are basically blocked there \u2014 Russia is the current flash point in the censorship wars.Over the summer, the Russian government began demanding that anyone with at least 3,000 daily visitors follow rules similar to those applying to a media company and face content restrictions. So far, Twitter and Facebook are simply passing those requests along to their users without making sure anyone complies. Many do not, but so far the Russian government has not pressed the issue.But the pressure may intensify later this year. Starting Sept. 1, foreign technology companies are supposed to store data about Russian users on computers located in Russia and make a software key available to the government that could be used to unscramble and monitor private Internet communications.That would give the government leverage in showdowns with tech companies, since it could simply raid the facility or arrest local employees.Most Western technology companies have no data centers in Russia and no plans to change that.\u201cOur data centers are all in the United States,\u201d said Mr. Crowell of Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that our first data center outside the United States will be in Russia.\u201dGoogle, whose search engine is the No. 2 player in Russia after the local Yandex service, has gone further, announcing recently that it will close its engineering offices in Russia. Although the company said it had been consolidating such offices globally, one factor in the closure is the risk of a raid by Russian authorities.\u201cIf what\u2019s going to happen is that Russians will show up and stick an AK-47 in an engineer\u2019s nostril, Google is going to make sure that no one in Russia has a Google engineering logon,\u201d said Ross J. Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University in Britain, who studies privacy and censorship issues and did some work for Google in the past.A Google spokesman declined to comment on its Russia strategy, saying only, \u201cWe are deeply committed to our Russian users and customers and we have a dedicated team in Russia working to support them.\u201dTwitter and Facebook have more room to maneuver. With far fewer users in Russia and virtually no advertising there, they can resist the government\u2019s demands with fewer repercussions.Robert Shlegel, a member of the Russian Parliament active in shaping the Kremlin\u2019s Internet policies, said in a phone interview that the Russian regulations were in many ways a response to the revelations of the former American intelligence contractor, Edward J. Snowden, about American government spying through Silicon Valley companies. \u201cThis problem was created by the United States,\u201d Mr. Shlegel said. Mr. Snowden lives in Russia, which granted him residency as the United States government sought to arrest him for his leaks.Russia\u2019s first preference, Mr. Shlegel said, is to persuade other nations to form a common, international set of rules for social networking sites and crowdsourced news, clarifying when countries could block pages to comply with national laws.He said that Russian authorities had no intention of blocking American Internet companies for failing to follow the data storage law. \u201cWhat we need to do is have a dialogue,\u201d he said.And given Western sanctions and the collapse in the ruble\u2019s value, Russia needs foreign business support, at least in part to prevent its online economy from grinding to a halt. If strictly enforced, the personal data law, for example, would close most Internet hotel and airline bookings, sending Russians to stand in line at travel agencies instead.Mr. Nosik, the Russian blogger, said that the country\u2019s Internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, was unlikely to ban American companies like Facebook, if only for fear that millions of Russians who suddenly lost access to years of photographs, family memories, love letters and contacts with friends would blame the Kremlin.Only Mr. Putin could decide to cut off access, he said. \u201cThe moment Putin wants it done, it will be done within minutes and no law will be required,\u201d Mr. Nosik said. \u201cOn the other hand, so long as Putin doesn\u2019t give the command to block them, they will not be blocked.\u201dVindu Goel reported from San Francisco and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economy Up, G.O.P. Wants a Little Credit", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After years of finding the dark lining in every silver economic cloud, Republicans are facing a political quandary that is dividing their leadership even as it buoys the nation: The economy appears to be achieving liftoff.To some Republicans, a strategic shift is in the offing: Obama\u2019s economy is still a failure, they argue, but welcome to the McConnell economy.\u201cWe\u2019re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new Senate majority leader, said this week. \u201cThe uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration\u2019s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress.\u201dAcross the Capitol, however, John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House speaker, was sticking to the old script, which played off the fact that wages for ordinary workers continued to lag.\u201cWhile the economy is showing some signs of improvement, far too many middle-class families are struggling to bridge the gap between rising costs and stubbornly flat paychecks,\u201d he said.How both parties finesse an economic recovery that is clearly gathering steam will have major ramifications for the coming presidential election cycle. In 2012, 45 percent of voters said the economy was not doing well, according to exit polls. Democrats carried those voters by a 13 percentage point margin. Two years later, those voters had had enough: 48 percent saw the economy negatively, and Republicans carried that group by 17 points.In the next election, who gets credit if opinion shifts again will matter enormously, said David Winston, a Republican pollster who consults closely with House Republican leaders.Grover Norquist, the conservative anti-tax activist and a herald of Republican messaging, took to Twitter in late December to begin taking credit for quickening economic growth, attributing it to Republican-engineered automatic spending cuts, budget showdowns and the locking in of most of the Bush tax cuts in January 2013.\u201cThere have been good things done over the objection of the president and the Democrats,\u201d he said on Thursday, before the job figures were released. \u201cWe ought to be able to point out that things are getting better compared to where they were, but that they are not good compared to where they should be. That\u2019s not in conflict.\u201dDemocrats called such credit-claiming fantasy. Most economists say the Republican budget brinkmanship of the last two years and the spending restraint promoted by G.O.P. lawmakers has hindered growth, not helped it. The surge in jobs and growth that began in spring 2014 started well before Republicans took over the Senate.PolitiFact, the nonpartisan fact checker, rated Mr. McConnell\u2019s claim to a connection between the Republican election sweep and the economic rebound as \u201cfalse.\u201d\u201cKey statistics show that the economic recovery was underway well before September, which is our best estimate for when the \u2018expectations\u2019 of a G.O.P. Senate solidified,\u201d PolitiFact wrote.For now, the naysayers among Republicans might have the public on their side. Consumer confidence is improving greatly, but political opinion hasn\u2019t shown much optimism, said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster at Public Opinion Strategies.But that might not last. Republican predictions of catastrophe before the 2012 election are already looking silly, Mr. Pethokoukis said.Instead, he gave them all raises.\u201cRule No. 1: Acknowledge reality,\u201d Mr. Pethokoukis advised.The problem for Republicans, he said, is that the economy\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 wage stagnation, growing income inequality and a squeezed middle class \u2014 don\u2019t lend themselves to the usual conservative response: deficit reduction and lowering the highest tax rates.Democrats have ready answers: Mr. Obama\u2019s new proposal to offer free community college tuition, his administration\u2019s cut to mortgage insurance rates charged to struggling home buyers, more construction jobs through expanded infrastructure projects, and tax increases on the rich to help pay for such programs. And they have long succeeded with many voters by painting the Republican Party as the handmaiden of the rich and powerful business interests.To counter that, Republicans will have to come up with their own responses aimed squarely at those left behind, Mr. Pethokoukis suggested, perhaps an expanded earned-income tax credit or requiring colleges to pay back a percentage of any loans on which their graduates default, giving schools more of a stake in their students\u2019 futures. In announcing his super PAC, The Right To Rise, Jeb Bush and his allies avoided any mention of tax cuts or budget deficits, focusing instead on income inequality and struggling Americans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Group Urges New York City to End Credit Checks by Employers", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City employers use credit checks to screen applicants for all sorts of jobs, like dog-walking and janitorial work. A coalition of municipal labor leaders, liberal advocates and left-leaning City Council members is seeking to end that practice, saying it disproportionately harms blacks and Hispanics without accurately predicting fraud or poor job performance.An earlier push for a ban on credit checks by New York employers died in the Council in December 2013. But 41 of the 51 members have signed on to the bill in its current form, and its sponsors say it will be a top priority for the Council in the first three months of the year. The fight over the bill, to the extent that there is one, will quite likely be over who is exempt from the ban. The current bill still permits credit checks by businesses that are required to perform them under federal or state law, such as banks that hire mortgage loan officers. But in a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Council on Thursday that was intended as something of a pre-emptive strike, the coalition said it wanted to ensure that \u201cunjustified exemptions\u201d were not written into the bill. \u201cSometimes the exemptions look benign, but they eat the law alive,\u201d said Sarah Ludwig, a signee and a founder and co-director of the New Economy Project, a justice advocacy organization.Proponents of a strict ban on credit checks by employers, who include a number of prominent political allies of the mayor, say it unfairly hurts Hispanic and black people who are already singled out by predatory lending practices that contribute to poor credit histories.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said many of his members had undergone credit checks before or after being hired. The practice can place people with credit trouble in an untenable situation, he said: \u201cPeople want to pay off loans, but because of their troubles, they can\u2019t even get a job.\u201dMr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, Phil Walzak, said the administration \u201csupports efforts to remove credit discrimination as an unnecessary obstacle to employment.\u201d But he said it was studying \u201cinstances where exemptions may be appropriate.\u201dOther states have enacted exemptions covering workers in law enforcement, retail and the banking and insurance industries.The coalition said it wanted to ensure that \u201cunjustified exemptions\u201d were not written into a bill that would end the practice.Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said the mayor and the Council should consider \u201ccommon-sense\u201d exemptions adopted in 10 states and in Chicago. In Connecticut, she noted, credit checks are allowed for an employee with an expense account, a corporate credit card or special access to a computer network beyond a firewall. \u201cTechnology has created new exposure for consumers that require great care for companies with regard to who they put in place with access to information,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.New York City employers are sensitive to concerns about discrimination in credit checks, she said, but believe they can be used responsibly and without bias.Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said he drafted it because credit checks created unfairness in hiring. Though there is no evidence that workers with poor credit will perform badly or commit fraud, Mr. Lander said, \u201cpeople have a prejudice that that would be true.\u201dHe said he was not open to broad exemptions, such as those sought by financial services.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why You Should Be More Optimistic About Wage Growth", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportThat is, wage growth remains muted after all.But realize that the concern about the well-being of workers is a concern about their real wages, which is a measure of what they can buy with their paycheck. Friday morning\u2019s report tells us what is happening with nominal or money wages, the total number of dollars in your paycheck, with no adjustment for inflation.Even if nominal wages were rising quickly, we have no idea how much of that will translate into higher real wages, because we don\u2019t know the extent to which businesses will pass through higher labor costs into higher inflation. Likewise, it remains possible that even weak growth in nominal wages will actually yield moderate growth in real wages. Indeed, the recent declines in gas prices are doing exactly that.To me, the big unknown that these data can speak to is how many of the jobless we will be able to get back to work. Federal Reserve policy makers remain concerned that if unemployment falls too far, wages will start to rise, which might fuel inflation, forcing them to choke off the recovery. Notice that their concerns focus on nominal, rather than real, wages. They worry about the growth in actual labor costs that firms might pass on as higher prices.In the economic models that inform these debates, wage and price inflation is expected to rise whenever unemployment falls below its so-called natural rate. The problem, though, is that no one really knows what that rate is. Our uncertainty is even greater today than it normally is, because no one knows the extent to which those workers who dropped out of the labor force in response to the financial crisis will return when jobs become plentiful. By this view, today\u2019s most important macroeconomic question is what the natural rate actually is.The latest jobs report helps answer this question. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, and there are still no signs that wage inflation is rising. Indeed, with wage growth running at only 1.7 percent, the economy is telling us that we still have the ability to bring many more of the jobless back into the fold without setting off inflation.It is only when nominal wage growth exceeds the sum of inflation (about 2 percent) and productivity growth (about 1.5 percent) that the Fed needs to be concerned that the labor market is generating cost pressures that might raise inflation. So the latest wage growth numbers suggest that we are not yet near the natural rate. And that means the Fed should be content to let the recovery continue to generate more new jobs.The predicament that policy makers will then face is whether to trust their estimates of the natural rate \u2014 which would lead them to raise interest rates in an effort to slow the economy \u2014 or to reassess just what they think the natural rate is. The longer that moderate growth in nominal wages and lower unemployment show they can peacefully coexist, the stronger the case for believing the natural rate is lower than policy makers currently believe.So yes, there\u2019s good news to be gleaned from reports that nominal wage growth remains muted: It\u2019s the economy telling us that it\u2019s ready to put more people back to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth Rate Put at 2.6% as Economy Pulls Ahead", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPowered by healthy spending from increasingly optimistic consumers, the American economy is emerging as an island of relative strength in the face of renewed torpor and turmoil elsewhere in much of the world.Just hours after Russia unexpectedly cut interest rates on Friday in response to a shrinking economy and worries over its banks, and European officials reported more signs of weakness on the Continent, new government data showed the American economy grew at a decent 2.6 percent rate in the final quarter of 2014.That pace represents a downshift from the blistering 5 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter and was modestly below what economists had been expecting. Nonetheless, most economists viewed the report in a positive light and saw the robust consumer spending as pointing to an improving economy in 2015.The combination of plunging energy prices and a healthier job market in late 2014 helped consumer spending rise last quarter by 4.3 percent, the fastest rate of growth since early 2006. And in a separate report on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment in January rose to its highest level since January 2004.\u201cThe windfall to consumption from lower energy prices is showing up,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cAnd we all know that over the long term, where the consumer goes, the economy goes.\u201dNot everything was rosy, though. While consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic output in the United States, there were weaknesses elsewhere that could drag on growth in the months ahead and which are likely to foster continuing turmoil in markets for stocks, bonds and currencies. The country\u2019s trade balance deteriorated, shaving a full percentage point off the overall growth rate, as export gains slowed sharply from earlier in the year, while imports surged.Although any single quarter represents a snapshot of the economy, rather than a nuanced portrait, experts suggested the falloff in net exports reflected a stronger dollar, which makes imported goods more competitive domestically while increasing the price of American products abroad. It also reflected weakness in Europe and other overseas markets, which are becoming tougher for American companies.\u201cAlthough cheaper imports are a boon for shoppers, import growth will subtract significantly from growth in G.D.P. in 2015 and 2016,\u201d said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS. He expects the economy to expand at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015, as lower energy prices encourage shoppers to keep spending, overwhelming other headwinds.Friday\u2019s estimate by the Commerce Department of economic output last quarter is the first of three the government will make; as more data is reported, upward or downward revisions are possible. One clue will come next week, when trade figures for December are released.For all of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of 2.4 percent, roughly in line with the underlying trend of the last five years.One notable negative in late 2014 was a 1.9 percent fall in spending on new equipment by companies, reversing increases of more than 11 percent in the previous two quarters. Many economists expect business spending to be lackluster in the coming months, hurt by deep cuts among drillers and other energy companies because of plunging oil prices.Military spending, which tends to be volatile, plunged last quarter and was another major drag on the overall trend, subtracting about 0.4 percentage point from the growth rate.\u201cThe composition was what we thought: strong private consumption, modest growth in investment and drags from trade and government spending,\" Mr. Gapen added. \u201cBut I think the government spending drag is a one-off and there is tangible evidence that the consumer is in a much better place than in previous years.\"Looking ahead, many economists expect 2015 to start off at about the pace of last quarter\u2019s trend, with growth picking up over the course of the year.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, is looking for the economy to grow by about 2.7 percent in 2015. As was the case last quarter, he expects consumers to more than make up for whatever softness there is in spending by companies.In a separate but closely watched announcement also released Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that its employment cost index rose 0.6 percent in December, slightly better than the figures for hourly wages and about what was expected.This quarterly survey of compensation costs is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, as well as many private economists, to gauge overall wage growth for American workers.This week, the Fed signaled it would not raise short-term interest rates before June, at the earliest. Although Fed policy makers have been encouraged by stronger hiring, they remain concerned about very weak inflation along with paltry wage gains.The 0.6 percent rise in compensation costs was healthy, Mr. Berger said, but not big enough to persuade Fed policy makers to move up their expected rate increase, which he predicts will come in September.By contrast, the outlook in Europe seems to be getting grimmer.In Western Europe, officials said on Friday that prices in the eurozone fell for the second month in a row in January, underscoring weak demand there and highlighting the challenges facing the European Central Bank in getting inflation closer to its annual target of 2 percent, which would help encourage more spending by business and consumers.In Moscow, the Central Bank of Russia abruptly cut interest rates by two percentage points to 15 percent, in an effort to ease the strain on the country\u2019s financial system but risking a further fall in the ruble. Russia, a major energy producer, is also reeling from falling crude prices as well as sanctions imposed as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.\u201cWe\u2019re leading the pack here in terms of economic growth,\u201d Mr. Handler, crediting the Fed\u2019s aggressive efforts in recent years to stimulate the economy, which the E.C.B. has only very recently begun to emulate after years of more timid steps. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do the navel gazing we had in Europe.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Mainstream on Their Own Terms", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewA photo from the 1941 American Indian Exposition Parade in Anadarko, Okla., one of the works in \u201cFor a Love of His People: The Photography of Horace Poolaw,\u201d at the National Museum of the American Indian, in Lower Manhattan.Assimilation was happening, though not necessarily as the government planned. It was taking place on Native American schedules and terms. Mr. Poolaw\u2019s father was a United States Army scout at Fort Sill, but he also assumed the roles of medicine man and tribal historian for the Kiowa. The merging of worlds, at a grass-roots level, became the coincidental subject of Mr. Poolaw\u2019s photographs. Family, which extended to a multitribal kinship network, was always Mr. Poolaw\u2019s primary subject, and he was rarely far away from it. An exception was during World War II, when he was in the Army studying and teaching aerial photography. After his stint, he started a farm near the small city of Anadarko, where he documented the ceremonial side of daily life, including weddings and funerals.Such images of small-town patriotism and loss could have been from almost anywhere in America at the time. But these particular photographs were of people who, less than a century earlier, had been targets of warfare on American turf. As politically neutral as Mr. Poolaw seems to be, he is in touch with this history of alienation, and that comes out in his pictures of Indian fairs in Oklahoma and elsewhere. The annual American Indian Exposition at Anadarko was one of the best known, and he was its official photographer, recording its motorcade parades of tribal beauty queens and leaders, and its elaborate performances, which regularly included elaborate, new, made-for-the-moment \u201ctraditional\u201d dances and costumes. The fairs were valuable. They fortified tribal identity and attracted tourist dollars. And Mr. Poolaw, in his pictures, seems to take an insider\u2019s delight in their pageantry. Yet he also positions himself just far enough on the outside to catch everything that\u2019s really going on. In a 1950s picture of children in war bonnets dancing at the Anadarko expo, he pulls way back, to take in the dancers and their grandstand audience as well as a crowd of non-Indian photographers bunched on the edge of the performing space to capture the version of Native American life that is being staged for them. Critical commentary, pointed or casual, is built into Mr. Poolaw\u2019s view of modern Indian culture, though over all his approach is closer to appreciation, full-hearted without nostalgia. His image of a line of pallbearers straining to carry a coffin at a Kiowa funeral has the solemn grace of an ancient Greek frieze. And an early picture, from around 1928, of his younger sister Trecil Poolaw Unap carrying a little pet dog is as tender and loving an American portrait as I ever hope to see.He was among the first Native Americans to be able to make that professional claim. For this reason alone, his work is innovative. And it is a reminder that innovation \u2014 an impulse for change, an appetite for newness \u2014 is itself a tradition in Native American culture, one that permitted Mr. Poolaw to spend his life in one place and make art that always feels fresh and in motion. It\u2019s been said that America itself will never be at rest, socially or spiritually, until it has fully acknowledged and begun to repair the damage done to its first people, including damage inflicted through image-making. But Mr. Poolaw\u2019s work, and the work of the artists who have succeeded him, clearly show that Native Americans are not waiting around for that. They\u2019re shaping their own restorative images of both Native and American, doing for America what America cannot, or will not, do for itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adding Innovations, the Pro Bowl is Trying to Be Relevant. Stop Laughing.", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven the N.F.L.\u2019s obsession with rules, protocols and procedures, the Pro Bowl is the equivalent of the league letting its hair down. Players chuckle with one another on the field, wear wacky uniforms and talk openly about how the game, which is often played in Hawaii, is a vacation. But in recent years, the level of play fell so much \u2014 even by the low standards of professional all-star games \u2014 that the Pro Bowl was mocked and the N.F.L. considered shutting it down. It did not help that despite years of tinkering, including moving the game to one week before the Super Bowl instead of one week after it, the event lost nearly $4 million annually during recent games held in Hawaii. Television ratings were sometimes dismal as well.In 2012, Commissioner Roger Goodell called the Pro Bowl embarrassing and said that if it could not be more competitive, he was \u201cinclined not to play it.\u201dThis alarmed the players, who have long seen the game as a perk as well as an honor. So Domonique Foxworth, then the president of the N.F.L. Players Association, promised that the players would take the game more seriously and came up with ways to make it more compelling. Alumni captains were chosen to pick teams that were no longer divided by conference, rules were changed to speed up the game and minimize injuries, and the game became a showcase for experiments. The novelties have continued. This year, for instance, the uprights will be 14 feet apart, about four and a half feet narrower than usual. The tablets that were used on the sidelines for the first time this season will also display video, not just photographs.\u201cThere were a couple of years it was horrible, when it seemed like tag football,\u201d Foxworth said. \u201cBut the players told me they enjoyed playing together, so I came up with some ideas to keep the game.\u201dThe game has changed location, too. For only the third time in the Super Bowl era, the Pro Bowl on Sunday will be played in the same stadium as the Super Bowl. The first two times that happened were 1967, in Los Angeles, and 2010, in Miami Gardens, Fla.This time around, Michael Bidwill, one of the owners of the Arizona Cardinals, recognized that the league had not yet made final its agreement to play in Hawaii in 2015, so he asked the league to take the game to his state to lift the local economy. \u201cThe state has already invested in the Super Bowl, so the fact they get a second event is a bonus,\u201d Bidwill said. \u201cWe hope this turns into a soft infomercial for Arizona.\u201dThe N.F.L. is committed to returning to Hawaii in 2016. But holding the event in Glendale, Ariz., has advantages for the league. The N.F.L.\u2019s operations staff does not need to be split between two states, and it can use the game as a dry run for the Super Bowl. The league can spend less to host the players in Arizona than in Hawaii and can generate more revenue because about 15,000 more tickets will be sold for the game in University of Phoenix Stadium than for a typical game in Honolulu.As the host team, the Cardinals helped sell tickets to the game by offering them to their fans, many of whom could not afford tickets to the Super Bowl but were willing to pay about as much as they would for a Cardinals home game to see some of the league\u2019s best players.\u201cWe jumped on the opportunity because it\u2019s not something we can go to every year,\u201d said Juan Garza, a longtime Cardinals season-ticket holder.Garza said he happily paid $120 for two tickets to the Pro Bowl. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go to see some players we don\u2019t see on a regular basis,\u201d he said.Even though all 63,000 tickets, from $25 to $200, have been sold, the game is likely to lose money. That is because the N.F.L. will not receive a $4 million subsidy from the Hawaii Tourism Authority for holding the event in that state. The players on the winning Pro Bowl team will also still receive $55,000 each, while players on the losing team will earn $28,000.Foxworth and Jim Steeg, who ran the Pro Bowl for the N.F.L. between 2000 and 2005, said the financial losses often did not include the value of having the game on television, which provides a harder-to-quantify benefit to sponsors and the league. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t allocate any television money to the game, it\u2019s hard to make money,\u201d Steeg said. \u201cIt was barely making or losing money when I was doing it.\u201dRatings stagnated during the past decade, but they improved when the Pro Bowl was moved to the weekend before the Super Bowl in 2010, even though that meant that players on each Super Bowl team would not be able to take part. While the Pro Bowl still has weaker ratings than nationally televised regular-season games, it attracts more viewers than the Major League Baseball and N.B.A. All-Star Games.For now, these changes have breathed some life into the game. But it is unclear whether they will secure the game in the long term. \u201cLast year, it was great,\u201d Foxworth said. But he added, \u201cOne year is not enough to say it\u2019s safe.\u201dN.F.L.

{"Headline": "As New Leadership Takes Over in Washington, Fiscal Battles Resurface", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the era of falling budget deficits coming to an end, President Obama and Congress are hurtling toward a clash over spending as the White House and Democrats press for an easing of fiscal austerity just as Republicans redouble efforts to balance the budget.While both sides say they are trying to help the squeezed middle class, the divide between the two parties on actual fiscal policy may be as stark as at any time since Bill Clinton\u2019s first term and the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. Since then, Washington policy makers have been focused on issues like national defense, financial crises and recession, or at least on professing a common goal of balanced budgets and fiscal rectitude.But solid economic numbers and new leadership on key congressional committees have driven the parties apart. As one senior Democratic budget aide said, \u201cWe\u2019re on different planets.\u201d On Monday, Mr. Obama\u2019s budget for the fiscal year that begins in October will propose blowing through statutory spending caps for defense and domestic programs, kicking off a debate that must somehow navigate a series of deadlines this year, any of which could lead to significant economic disruptions.\u201cCongress is under new management, and so is this committee,\u201d Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Wednesday at the panel\u2019s first hearing of the new Congress. \u201cI intend to run a Budget Committee dedicated to the proposition that we must confront spending, bring the deficit to an end and, ultimately, balance the budget.\u201dSenator Bernard Sanders, a liberal independent from Vermont and the panel\u2019s new ranking member, retorted: \u201cThere are other deficits in our society that have been causing horrendous pain for the vast majority of the American people. These are deficits in decent-paying jobs, deficits in infrastructure, deficits in income, deficits in equality.\u201dIt is not just Mr. Sanders. Mr. Obama and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, are pushing measures to raise taxes on the rich to bolster the incomes of middle-class families. Democrats on the Budget Committee were once led by moderate fiscal hawks; now, the ranking members are far more liberal.And while Republicans are also speaking more about wage stagnation and income inequality, the party remains united around a traditional platform of spending constraint and deficit reduction, which leaders still say is the answer to sluggish growth and bridging the divide in incomes.\u201cWage stagnation is a byproduct of slow economic growth,\u201d Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, said at a hearing on Tuesday.Division in Washington is nothing new, but gridlock and inaction seems not to be an option this year. A series of fiscal showdowns will be coming, starting with an end to Department of Homeland Security funding on Feb. 28, a sharp cut in physician payments under Medicare on March 31, the depletion of the highway trust fund on May 31, a debt-ceiling showdown this summer or fall and the return of across-the-board mandatory cuts known as sequestration on Oct. 1.If those cuts happen, \u201cwe will not be able to defeat an adversary, deny another adversary and defend the homeland,\u201d Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, the Air Force chief of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. \u201cI do not believe that is good for America.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Obama will unveil a proposed budget for the 2016 fiscal year that presumes sequestration will end. Under the president\u2019s plan, spending for programs at the discretion of Congress could exceed caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 by as much as $70 billion: half for defense, half for domestic programs.That would be a 7 percent increase over the current year, modest in an overall budget expected to top $3.9 trillion. But any breach of spending caps will prompt a major fight with Congress. Mr. Obama\u2019s base defense budget would be $534 billion, a senior administration official said, exceeding spending caps by $35 billion.Next year\u2019s defense request, which will also include separate spending for the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, is being billed by the administration as accepting the fiscal reality of austerity while reflecting an end to two exhausting land wars. The result, they say, will continue to be a military capable of defeating any adversary but too small for protracted foreign occupations.The Defense Department remains determined to invest in big-ticket items, like new naval ships and submarines and advanced bombers. The Pentagon is also expected to seek funding for more of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\u201cWe have always, in the past, come down from our wartime footing to a significantly lower level of global engagement, and that is just not the case anymore,\u201d said Ryan Crotty, the deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Democrats also hope Republican defense hawks such as Senator John McCain of Arizona, the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will push Republican leaders to increase military spending, something Democrats will not accept without more domestic spending.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: If we continue with these arbitrary defense cuts, we will harm our military\u2019s ability to keep us safe,\u201d Mr. McCain said at his hearing Wednesday.\u201cThis comes down to a battle in the Republican Party between fiscal hawks and defense hawks,\u201d Mr. Van Hollen said Wednesday, \u201cand you will see a lot of pressure from defense folks to raise the caps.\u201dHelene Cooper contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Signs Pointing to Bigger Raises in 2015", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsAll eyes are on wages. For workers who have faced six years of stagnant pay, Federal Reserve officials trying to decide when they can safely raise interest rates, or anyone who wants the United States economy to experience a truly robust recovery, the single biggest question about the economy in 2015 is whether pay raises will become more commonplace.Three pieces of news on Tuesday point to yes.There are new signs that American workers, especially at the middle and low end of the pay scale, may finally start having enough negotiating leverage to demand wage increases in excess of inflation.The second piece of news is the latest survey from the National Federation of Independent Business. Its members, small businesses around the country, reported the highest level of overall optimism since 2006, and, more to the point, showed that small businesses were expecting to increase worker pay.The proportion of small businesses planning to increase compensation in the next three months was 17 percentage points higher than those that planned decreases, the widest margin since 2007.And next year, the company plans to offer a new health benefits program to lower out-of-pocket expenses for low-income workers that the company says could save employees up to $4,000, essentially combining the raise this year with better benefits next year.But if the trends we\u2019re seeing elsewhere in the data hold up, including those released Tuesday, raising wages could prove to be a sensible decision based purely on business strategy. If job growth continues at its recent pace over the next couple of years, companies that resist raising wages may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, losing their best workers to companies like Aetna that try to get ahead of the curve a bit with pre-emptive raises.We don\u2019t know if that will happen, of course. Maybe the path of job growth will slow as we get closer to full employment. Maybe more of the millions of people no longer in the labor force will enter in larger numbers, holding down wages even longer.But the flow of news Tuesday presents a coherent, consistent story: Employers have lots of openings they need to fill. Small businesses surveyed expect to raise pay in the coming months. And one giant employer is doing exactly that.Add it up, and Aetna workers may not be the only ones seeing raises this year.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when the photograph was taken. It was in July, not January.The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Strong Dollar Is Always Good, Except When It Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesUnited States Treasury secretaries routinely say that they favor a strong dollar, regardless of circumstances or economic conditions. And the dollar is strong right now, thanks in no small part to actions by foreign central banks.The European Central Bank significantly loosened its monetary policy on Thursday, in the process driving down the euro and bolstering the dollar. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar\u2019s value has soared 19 percent since May, and the momentum seems to be building.But is it really a good thing \u2014 for the United States and the global economy?A weaker dollar was, arguably, one of the reasons for the health of the American economy, compared with other nations. The stronger dollar that has resulted from that period of American advantage could reverse some of the progress that the United States has made. That\u2019s not obviously a good thing for the United States.No matter. The dollar is a potent symbol of America\u2019s global power, and United States government officials habitually bow to it, even when their comments aren\u2019t firmly linked to policy or geopolitical reality, said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell University professor of economics who is the author of the \u201cThe Dollar Trap,\u201d a study of the dollar\u2019s role in global finance.\u201cThe notion that a strong country always has a strong currency isn\u2019t something that many countries subscribe to,\u201d he said. As a continental power that doesn\u2019t rely on exports to the extent that many other nations do, he said, \u201cthe United States has been able to sustain the illusion of the importance of a strong currency, but really, when the dollar is fairly strong, as it is now, it\u2019s a mixed blessing for the economy of the United States.\u201dDisentangling the factors that affect foreign exchange rates \u2014 and that make the dollar strong \u2014 isn\u2019t simple. Supply and demand in the marketplace can be masked temporarily by canny trading and improper market activities.For the most part, though, it appears that the dollar has strengthened for substantive reasons: It has become more attractive than other currencies, on a relative basis, because it\u2019s linked to the American economy, which has been growing more rapidly than those of most other developed countries.What\u2019s more, the monetary cycle in the United States has diverged from that in many other countries: The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is considering interest rate increases, and it has ended bond purchases \u2014 or quantitative easing. That reflects the growth of the American economy, a big contrast with Europe and Japan, which are struggling. Last week, the European Central Bank embarked on a new, 1 trillion euro ($1.16 trillion) campaign of quantitative easing, and it has been further lowering interest rates that are already extraordinarily low and sometimes in negative territory.In Japan, the central bank has also been aggressively expanding its quantitative easing program and keeping interest rates low.Furthermore, the dollar has worldwide appeal as a \u201csafe haven,\u201d a destination currency in times of global trouble. That role is likely to become more crucial now that the Swiss franc, another traditional haven, has begun to gyrate wildly in value. That has occurred since Jan. 15, when the Swiss National Bank eliminated the franc\u2019s peg to the euro and started charging banks interest of 0.75 percent to hold their reserves.The Greek elections on Sunday, which have already unnerved financial markets, could well add more immediate luster to the dollar.Whether this is truly good for the United States is another matter.There are some clear benefits, which Mr. Prasad enumerated. Global money flooding into dollar-denominated investments tends to lower interest rates in this country. That typically makes home mortgages cheaper, and a variety of assets more valuable, including houses, bonds and stocks. Americans abroad can buy more with dollars, and imported goods like clothing are cheaper. Add that to the windfall for consumers coming from lower oil prices and it could stimulate the economy.But there are obvious problems, too. There could be negative spillover effects in emerging markets, where corporate debt has increasingly been dollar-denominated. As that debt becomes more expensive in local currencies, financial stress is likely to heighten.American exports tend to become more expensive abroad, too, hurting businesses that make them and reducing the rate of job creation. \u201cIf the dollar were to become much stronger and it persisted, there will be an outcry,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.More than 40 percent of revenue for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index come from abroad, and those with significant foreign operations will have earnings problems, if they haven\u2019t hedged their currency exposure.Bespoke Investment Group offered a good example of how two companies\u2019 fortunes have diverged in the last year, as the dollar has strengthened. In 2008, Altria, the old Philip Morris tobacco group, divided in two, based mainly on revenue source: Altria\u2019s revenue is generated in the United States; Philip Morris International\u2019s revenue is generated abroad.Since the dollar began to rise last year, Altria Group, the domestic company, has skyrocketed, while Philip Morris, the international company, has \u201cflatlined,\u201d Bespoke said in a report to clients.All of which suggests that a strong dollar isn\u2019t entirely and always good, whatever the Treasury secretary says. But it is something we will have to learn to live with.An article last Sunday about the drawbacks of a strong dollar misstated the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing campaign in United States dollars. It is $1.16 trillion, not billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rebels Claim to Have Control of Ukraine Airport", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Leaders of a Russian-backed rebel movement in eastern Ukraine claimed on Friday to have captured the Donetsk city airport, a symbolically important and long-sought prize, although central government officials denied this was the case.A senior leader for the rebels, the pro-Russian Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, described the fight as the start of a new offensive to push Ukraine out of the east.If the claim is true, it would signal the first significant territorial advance by the rebels since the signing of the cease-fire pact.That cease-fire broke down almost immediately, with daily violations. Neither side has been able to claim additional territory since the cease-fire was signed, often making it impossible to ascertain who had started a skirmish or why. An advance, by contrast, would suggest an incontrovertible violation.It was unclear, as with so many other of the pro-Russian rebel leadership\u2019s actions, whether the Russian authorities had condoned the advance; last fall, German officials had reportedly warned that the capture of the airport would provoke additional sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy, which is struggling.In an online statement Friday, the military authorities for the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic said that \u201ctoday, we can speak about control over the territory of Donetsk airport and its surroundings.\u201dA video posted by the Russian news media showed a rebel flag flying over the ruins of the hulking, glass-and-steel main terminal of Sergei Prokofiev International Airport. The air-traffic control tower collapsed this week, in a sign of the intensity of the artillery fire striking the site.Despite the claims, the statement conceded that Ukrainian forces remained on airport territory. \u201cThere are still about 10 Ukrainian soldiers left in the new terminal, but they have ceased to offer resistance,\u201d it said.The leader of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, said on Thursday after a conference with Ukrainian Army officers about the airport that he intended to press an offensive and recapture territory lost to government forces. That territory lies outside the partially demarcated line of control established in the Sept. 5 agreement.\u201cThey are on territory which they do not control and will never be under their control,\u201d Mr. Zakharchenko said of the Ukrainian Army, in remarks later posted online.\u201cWe will go further, to Slovyansk, to Kramatorsk, and so on,\u201d he said, referring to Ukrainian-controlled towns now far from the front.Ukrainian officials acknowledged the intensification of the assault on the airport but denied that they had lost control of what has been the central government\u2019s toehold in the rebel capital, Donetsk. \u201cOur guys are still defending it,\u201d Denis Ermak, a military analyst with the Dnipro-1 battalion, said in a telephone interview.The battle for airport ruins is a harrowing, close-quarter fight that has stretched on for months.The main terminal, built for the Euro 2012 soccer tournament, is a battered and booby-trapped wreck where rebel fighters control the third floor and above.Ukrainian forces hold the first and second floors, and access to subterranean tunnels originally laid for communications cables.The rebel forces are aided, if not led, by Russian special forces, in the Ukrainian view, a charge that Russia denies.Mr. Ermak said that the Russian-backed side has now seized a surface-level supply route into the terminal building and raised a flag over it, while not actually controlling it. The Ukrainian Army can still supply those inside the building through the tunnels, he said, but the defense of the airport is becoming more tenuous by the day.\u201cThey fight through holes in the floor, with booby traps, by blowing up walls and in the stairwells,\u201d he said of the combat in the building. \u201cThe situation is difficult. They want to show the world they have taken the airport, but they have not. Our guys are still defending it. Every day and every night there are attacks.\u201dIn the past three days, the separatists have also deployed a new weapon not seen openly before in eastern Ukraine, called the Buratino, or the Pinocchio, which fires powerful thermobaric, or \u201cvacuum bomb,\u201d rockets from a tank chassis. Only Russia could have provided them this weapon, Mr. Ermak said. Russia has denied providing any weapons to the east.A report posted on Thursday by LifeNews, a Russian news agency with a strong pro-rebel slant, showed separatist fighters moving amid the rubble of the airport\u2019s new terminal, firing assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades in what the report called a \u201csweep\u201d to flush out the final Ukrainian holdouts.At least one rebel front-line commander on Friday conceded that the airport was not yet captured, but he said that it would be soon. \u201cAnother day or two and the airport will be ours,\u201d the rebel commander, who uses the nickname Zhora, said in a telephone interview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shrinking American Middle Class", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nThe middle class, if defined as households making between $35,000 and $100,000 a year, shrank in the final decades of the 20th century. For a welcome reason, though: More Americans moved up into what might be considered the upper middle class or the affluent. Since 2000, the middle class has been shrinking for a decidedly more alarming reason: Incomes have fallen.Younger households have borne the brunt of the slowdown. Those headed by people aged 30 through 44 are more likely to be lower income \u2014 and less likely to be middle income \u2014 than in 2000. Older households have done better. With more people working into their late 60s and wages rising for older workers, households headed by people 65 and older are now more likely to be middle or upper income than in the past, though they are still overrepresented in the lower-income group.Education matters more than it used to. In the 1970s, high school graduates who did not have a four-year college degree were well represented among the middle and upper class. They no longer are, as high-paying, blue-collar jobs have become rarer. College graduates have not suffered as much, though they are also less likely to be high income than they were in 2000.Whites were already more likely to be in the middle- or upper-income groups when the 21st century began, and the gap has widened a bit in the past 15 years. Fully half of black households were lower income in 2013, while 43 percent of Hispanic households were; both numbers have risen 5 percentage points since 2000. Asian households, by contrast, are slightly less likely than white households to be low income.When people talk about the middle class, they\u2019re often thinking about a married couple with children at home. But the reality is more complicated. Many of those two-adult households have advanced up the income ladder, and they make up a disproportionately large share of the upper-income group. Households with one adult, by comparison, are overrepresented among the lower-income group. The middle class contains a large number of all such households: those with two adults and those with one, those with children at home and those without.Notes: Mixed-race households are included in the \u201cother\u201d race group; Not all race categories are available historically; Households headed by adults 65 and older are not shown in the family status charts.Sources: U.S. Census Bureau; Minnesota Population Center/IPUMSThe demand has created an unusually close partnership between the Gulf Coast energy industry and community colleges to train people for disappearing skills.Advertisement"}

The Europeans and Americans so strikingly absent from Mr. Kostin\u2019s opening-night party were barely on the agenda.Appearing on a government television channel, Russia 24, from Davos on Thursday, Mr. Deripaska said Russia was \u201csomewhere between 1993 and 1995\u201d in terms of complex, acute economic problems. With irony, he added, \u201cThere is only one positive point: It is clear that it will be bad,\u201d and that rosy forecasts had been completely overtaken. Asked if he had told Russia\u2019s leaders that, he said he was too busy working. But he added, \u201cThe worst is yet to come.\u201dRussia entered Davos defiant. Arkady Dvorkovich, a deputy prime minister, identified Europe and the United States, not lower oil prices, as Russia\u2019s biggest problem.\u201cRight now, there is major volatility, but it\u2019s not going to last for long,\u201d Mr. Dvorkovich said. He added that Russia would use its reserves to stabilize its banking system and make up for lost revenue.\u201cThe economy will slide, but it\u2019s not going to last forever, even with sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will find a way to grow.\u201dBy Friday, Russians admitted their pain. \u201cWe are not benefiting from sanctions; we are losing,\u201d Mr. Kostin said at a Russia session.Aleksei L. Kudrin, the former finance minister, who still maintains good ties to the Kremlin, went further. \u201cThe most important problem for the government is trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout structural reforms, we won\u2019t have trust, and won\u2019t be able to get out of this mess.\u201dGradually, the session descended into a classic Russian argument about history among those on the podium, and then with a well-known critical journalist, Yevgenia M. Albats. The Russian Internet exploded in scorn after Mr. Shuvalov acknowledged earning handsomely from Russia\u2019s shift from communism to capitalism, which he admitted had brought millions of his compatriots to ruin.Attendees from China, which Mr. Putin has pursued as an alternative to the now damaged ties with the West, looked on in astonishment.\u201cI was rather surprised that the Russians differed with each other so strongly,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University, who was on the podium.He echoed the Russians in saying China\u2019s business community is flocking to Russia. Trade is expected to increase to $100 billion this year from $90 billion in 2014, he said.But Li Daokui of Tsinghua University in Beijing, sharing a podium with Kirill A. Dmitriev, who heads Russia\u2019s direct investment fund, suggested that Russia was less than a coveted partner.\u201cThe Russian economy is not doing well,\u201d he said, noting projections of a 5 percent contraction this year on top of existing damage. Russia may be speeding up talks with China, he added, but \u201cRussia should have done projects with Europe, with Eastern Europe, with other parts of the world.\u201dAt a party hosted by another Russian bank, Sberbank, a few veterans of European-Russian business appeared. German Gref, the bank\u2019s head, explicitly thanked friends for their support.But the dearth of new business was plain. While big German firms have not shut down operations in Russia, they are not making new investments.That trend holds across Western Europe, said Michael Rake, head of the Confederation of British Industry.John Smith of Bain & Company, one of the few Westerners at the VTB opening party, recalled the heady days of helping to design Russia\u2019s rough and ready plunge into capitalism. One prime goal then, he said, was to make the shift irreversible.But the conflict in Ukraine has already undone much, despite the distaste of Western business and bankers for sanctions. \u201cBusiness hopes that common sense will prevail,\u201d Mr. Rake said, expressing a common sentiment.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has said Mr. Putin is testing the West over Ukraine, reiterated that sanctions would remain as long as Russia and its friends fought on.Last week, the partying could not mask the depth of their enmity and the high stakes in the conflict at Europe\u2019s eastern borders.Russian businessmen complained privately that the West was encouraging Ukraine to go after Russia and Kremlin-backed rebels in Ukraine\u2019s east. Western backers of Ukraine cast the conflict in epochal terms. It pits Mr. Putin\u2019s 19th-century vision against the modern world, they said.\u201cThe future of Russia will be decided by the success or failure of Ukraine,\u201d said Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister and prime minister.\u201cHistory will judge the West in 2015 as much, or more, by what it does for Ukraine as by what it does to Russia,\u201d said Lawrence H.

The yields on bonds of five other eurozone members \u2014 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands \u2014 also reached new lows, only slightly higher than Germany\u2019s.The euro, which would be relatively less attractive if the central bank pumped many more of them into the market through a bond-buying program, continued its fall of recent weeks, dropping on Wednesday to a $1.18, its lowest level since the end of 2005.The preliminary ruling was made by one of the advocates general at the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, Pedro Cruz Villal\u00f3n, who said that the bond-buying plan Mr. Draghi proposed in 2012 was \u201ccompatible\u201d with European Union treaties. Mr. Cruz Villal\u00f3n wrote that the program would be \u201csuitable for bringing about a reduction in the interest rates on government bonds\u201d and said the central bank would not be assuming \u201ca risk that will necessarily make it vulnerable to insolvency.\u201dBut he also warned that the central bank should \u201cproceed with particular caution\u201d when buying government bonds, to avoid creating speculative behavior in the market.Judges at the Court of Justice endorse the advice of their advocates general in a majority of cases, although their decisions typically come months later.Mr. Cruz Villal\u00f3n did not suggest any explicit limits on the size of the central bank\u2019s bond buying. Nor did he say that the European Central Bank should have priority over other bondholders if a debtor defaulted, a point that is likely to be viewed favorably by the central bank.If the central bank were a so-called senior bondholder, private investors might have been reluctant to buy the bonds. That, in turn, could undercut the aim of the bond-buying program, which is to create more demand and push down market interest rates.The opinion did warn the German constitutional court, which had referred the case to the Court of Justice, against meddling too much with European Central Bank policy. \u201cThe courts must exercise a considerable degree of caution when reviewing the E.C.B.\u2019s activity, since they lack the expertise and experience which the E.C.B. has in this area,\u201d it said.The opinion did, however, admonish the European Central Bank to better explain the rationale behind its policies. It also said the central bank should not buy government bonds immediately after they are issued, but should wait to allow markets to determine a price.Yves Mersch, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, called the opinion announced on Wednesday \u201can important milestone.\u201d\u201cWe have always been convinced\u201d that the bond-buying program at issue is \u201clegally sound and in line with our mandate,\u201d Mr. Mersch said in a statement.Jonathan Loynes, the chief European economist at Capital Economics in London, wrote in a research note that the ruling \u201cwould seem to clear the path for the implementation of a full-blown quantitative easing\u201d at the bank\u2019s policy meeting on Jan. 22.Some elements of the opinion could affect the way the program intended to help individual distressed economies would operate, but \u201cthere seems little here to prevent a Q.E. program aimed at loosening monetary policy across the eurozone as a whole,\u201d Mr. Loynes wrote, referring to quantitative easing.Even though the adviser effectively said an expanded program could go ahead, Mr. Draghi still faces challenges from the central bank\u2019s \u201cnatural caution\u201d and from Germany\u2019s objections, Mr. Loynes wrote. Many Germans fear that they will be stuck with the bill if eurozone countries like Greece or Italy are unable to pay their debts.Proponents of quantitative easing are concerned that limits on the program could undercut its psychological impact on financial markets by raising doubts about how far the central bank would be able to go to restore inflation.The central bank\u2019s official target for inflation is below, but close to, 2 percent.The program at issue in the lawsuit was intended to protect eurozone countries whose borrowing costs were being pushed higher by market panic. Quantitative easing has a different purpose \u2014 to generate inflation \u2014 and would probably involve purchases of bonds issued by all eurozone governments, rather than just those in crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mikhail Prokhorov Is Said to Be Seeking Potential Buyers for Nets", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years after he purchased the Nets and became the first overseas owner in the N.B.A., Mikhail D. Prokhorov is actively seeking potential buyers for the team, two people with knowledge of his plans said. The two people said Prokhorov was using the New York investment banker Evercore Partners to gauge interest in a sale. If it were to occur, Prokhorov would probably receive at least several times the $223 million that he paid in 2010 for 80 percent of the Nets and 45 percent of Barclays Center, the Brooklyn arena where the team plays. The market has changed drastically since Prokhorov entered the N.B.A. scene as a 6-foot-8-inch Russian oligarch who enjoyed making quips and very much wanted to make a splash. Since then, the Golden State Warriors were sold for $450 million, the Milwaukee Bucks were sold for $550 million and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers were purchased by Steve Ballmer for $2 billion.Ellen Pinchuk, a spokeswoman for Prokhorov, acknowledged that he was open to discussing the possible sale of the team. \u201cThat\u2019s his approach,\u201d Pinchuk said. \u201cBut nothing is imminent and nothing is in the works.\u201d She added that Prokhorov recognized \u201cthat the value of the team has increased many times since he bought it.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s a businessman,\u201d Pinchuk said. \u201cBut beyond that, nothing has changed from our point of view.\u201dSince last year, Evercore has also been seeking buyers for the stakes in the Nets and Barclays that are owned by Forest City Enterprises. Evercore\u2019s involvement with Prokhorov was first reported by Bloomberg News. Prokhorov\u2019s rationale for formally looking at offers is not known. But he could be frustrated with his team. When he bought the Nets in 2010, they were still playing in New Jersey and losing almost every game. He set a goal of contending for an N.B.A. title within five years. For a while, the team made progress. In 2012-13, the Nets\u2019 first season in Brooklyn, they went 49-33 and then lost in the first round of the playoffs. Last season, after making a daring trade for two aging Boston Celtics stars, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, the Nets went backward, finishing 44-38. They advanced to the second round in the postseason but did not seem to be a club on the rise.This season, they appear to be a team on the decline. Pierce has moved on, Garnett seems near the end of his career, and two players previously considered among the team\u2019s top stars \u2014 Deron Williams and Brook Lopez \u2014 have slowly evolved into injury-prone, inconsistent performers. Heading into Wednesday\u2019s game against Memphis, the Nets have a 16-22 record, have lost six games in a row and seem far removed from being a serious contender for a championship.Rather than brooding about the team, and the many millions he has lost in owning it, Prokhorov may now see an easy way to cash in for perhaps $1 billion in profit. He could also be looking to discard a valuable United States asset at a time when the Russian economy is in turmoil as it copes with Western penalties, the falling value of the ruble and tumbling oil prices. As for a potential buyer, acquiring a team in the New York market, where major sports franchises rarely go on sale, could be tantalizing.Leib suggested that an available team in New York could lure bids from wealthy people who would view a purchase as \u201cone of the last great ways to shield taxable income.\u201dThe Clippers\u2019 sale price was elevated by the prospect of greater riches coming from a new TV deal for the N.B.A. \u2014 which will nearly triple annual revenue from ESPN and TNT \u2014 and the presence of extremely wealthy bidders like Ballmer. But the Clippers do not own their home, Staples Center, while the Nets play in an arena controlled by Prokhorov and Bruce C. Ratner, through Forest City. That would surely enhance the Nets\u2019 value. This is not the first time Prokhorov has been said to be interested in selling the Nets. Last fall, there were reports of a complex deal in which he would have combined his assets with those of the investor group that owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. It was, at best, in an embryonic stage of negotiations when news of the discussions leaked, and the transaction never came to fruition.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudis Expand Regional Power as Others Falter", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The rulers of Saudi Arabia trembled when the Arab Spring revolts broke out four years ago.The catch, analysts and diplomats say, is that the ascendance of the Saudis is largely a byproduct of the feebleness or near-collapse of so many of the states around them, including Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain and Tunisia. And the perseverance of the old order is largely dependent on a steady flow of Saudi resources, so their influence may be costly.The Saudis are propping up the Kingdom of Bahrain, and are fighting alongside the United States to support the government in Baghdad. Billions of dollars from Saudi coffers are sustaining friendly governments in Egypt and Jordan. Saudi-backed militias are fighting in Libya, and Saudi-owned news media provide critical support for the monarchy\u2019s favored factions in Tunisia and elsewhere.The kingdom can claim limited victories, including the military-installed government in Cairo and the elected government in Tunis. But the same troubles facing its neighbors may also give Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers reason to worry. Its efforts have not yielded any sign of stability in Syria, Iraq or Libya. A Saudi-backed transition plan in neighboring Yemen has collapsed, leaving rebels supported by Iran in charge of the capital.\u201cA point of strength could be interpreted as a point of weakness,\u201d one senior Arab diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the Saudis. \u201cIf everybody around you is going wrong, then your influence around your borders is decreased,\u201d the diplomat said, adding: \u201cFrankly, everybody\u2019s influence in the Middle East has decreased. It is just a complete mess.\u201dFor an absolute monarchy tracing its dynastic roots back three hundred years, Saudi Arabia\u2019s taking a leading role in the struggle to reshape that mess is an unexpected outcome of the Arab Spring, which once stirred hopes for the rule of law and modern democracy.\u201cIt is ironic or anachronistic if viewed from outside,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad, a researcher at the state-funded Al Ahram Center for Strategic and International Studies in Cairo, and especially if one believes \u201cthe region is in urgent need of democracy.\u201d\u201cBut the last four years have testified against that,\u201d he said, \u201cand if the region is most in need of stability, effective governance and resources \u2014 all of which Saudi Arabia has \u2014 then it makes sense that it would play a leadership role, whatever the characteristics of its political system.\u201dThe king merely chuckled. \u201cBecause the truth is he has said \u2018I told you so\u2019 many times, and he continued to tell current administration officials that we were really wrong,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.Among the king\u2019s complaints, Mr. Jordan said: the urgency of the Bush administration\u2019s promotion of democracy, the vacuum left when the Americans withdrew from Iraq, the Obama administration\u2019s embrace of the Arab Spring revolts, and particularly the failure to fulfill threats of military action against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.(Mr. Assad, a client of Iran, is one strongman the Saudis want to be rid of, but some analysts argue that the United States is now following the broader logic of the Saudi preference for stability over democracy by softening its demands for Mr. Assad\u2019s exit.)\u201cThe Saudis don\u2019t want to show weakness. They don\u2019t want to show vulnerability to the winds of change in a way that might invite those changes,\u201d Mr. Jordan said, sympathizing somewhat with the Saudi desire to \u201cmanage the change rather than have it forced upon them.\u201d\u201cWhat would Saudi Arabia look like without the royal family? It would look like Libya, or Syria without Assad,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.Like Libya under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Saudi Arabia is controlled by a ruling family without the benefit of durable institutions in government or civil society. And like Syria, the Saudis \u2014 now led by King Salman \u2014 have kept a tight lid on simmering sectarian tensions between the kingdom\u2019s minority of Shiite Muslims and its Sunni rulers.Indeed, some historians argue that Saudi Arabia often projects its domestic anxieties onto the region. Worries about tensions with Shiites at home feed its rivalry with Shiite Iran, or fears about a domestic challenge from political Islamists fuel the kingdom\u2019s hostility to the Muslim Brotherhood abroad, said Toby Jones, a historian at Rutgers University who studies Saudi Arabia.\u201cThe Saudis say, \u2018These are things that need to be mastered\u2019 in the region, because they are also things that need to be mastered inside the kingdom,\u201d Professor Jones said.King Abdullah also let it be known behind the scenes that he disapproved of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s ouster, castigating American officials for abandoning him. And the Saudi rulers quietly rued the subsequent election of Islamists from the Muslim Brotherhood.When Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, then a general and a former military attach\u00e9 to Saudi Arabia, led a military takeover in Cairo in the summer of 2013, Saudi Arabia became his most important sponsor, quickly providing more than $12 billion in financial assistance.Last week, Mr. Sisi, who is now president, decreed an unusual seven days of national mourning for King Abdullah. That included canceling celebrations scheduled for Sunday to mark the fourth anniversary of the Arab Spring \u2014 a step activists here took as recognition of King Abdullah\u2019s role in the revolt\u2019s undoing.Nabil Fahmy, the foreign minister in Egypt\u2019s transitional government after the takeover, said the Saudis were only a \u201ccomplementary player\u201d to the domestic backlash against the Brotherhood.\u201cThe Saudis came out very quickly and said they supported us, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly this was going to happen.\u201dSaudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, is now committed to sustaining Mr. Sisi\u2019s government with billions of dollars in aid, probably for years to come. Egypt burned through about $20 billion from Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies in just the first year after the military takeover without much change to the government\u2019s balance sheet, and Egypt\u2019s currency is at a new low against the dollar.\u201cYes, it is a burden, undoubtedly, especially with the drop in the price of oil,\u201d said Mustafa Alani, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center who is close to the Saudi government. \u201cBut they are ready to stand behind the Egyptian economy for quite a long time, because the strategic cost of the failure would be even more of a burden if Egypt collapses.\u201dIn Tunisia, the Saudis contributed financial aid to help stabilize the government and lent public \u201cmoral support\u201d to the anti-Islamist leaders, Mr. Alani said, helping the security-first political faction remove the Islamist party from power through democratic elections.\u201cTunisia did not need a lot,\u201d Mr. Alani said, \u201cbut the Saudis have done what they needed to do.\u201dSaudi Arabia has emerged as the regional leader because \u201cthey were able to stand the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now they feel that, \u2018yes, you survived, great, but you need to stabilize the environment around you if you want to survive longer.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStill, Mr. Jones, the historian, said it was too soon to judge. \u201cThey are backing the same cast of characters that landed them in a vulnerable position in the first place,\u201d when the Arab Spring shook the region in 2011, he said. \u201cThis just turns back the clock.\u201dIt is the weakness of the existing order, he said, \u201cthat has produced the effect of making the Saudis look even more powerful, because they are the only ones left with enough power and resources to prop it up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Will Turn Spotlight on Asia With Trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines ", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Holy See\u2019s attention to Asia dates back centuries, but Francis has made the region a new priority, with two visits in less than six months, moderating a more Eurocentric vision of the church that has prevailed in recent years.On Monday, Francis called his trip to Asia a sign of his \u201cinterest and pastoral concern for the people of that vast continent.\u201d\u201cI wish to voice yet again the desire of the Holy See to offer its own contribution of service to the common good, to harmony and social concord,\u201d Francis said in his annual address to the diplomats assigned to the Vatican.Some envision an increasing political role for the Vatican in Asia, as Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state, has spoken openly of proposing solutions for peace in the many open conflicts around the world.In his comments to diplomats, the pope also said, \u201cIn particular, I express my hope for a resumption of dialogue between the two Koreas, sister countries, which speak the same language.\u201dHowever, Vatican watchers see little opening for a similar kind of mediating role in Asia, as many of the political situations in the region are extremely complicated and the Vatican\u2019s presence is not as longstanding as in America.Moreover, the neighboring Middle East and China are two very delicate grounds for the Vatican, and its mediation would not necessarily be seen as neutral and beneficial.Still, a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said, \u201cAsia is one of Francis\u2019 priorities.\u201d\u201cFor the global economy and politics, these are two peripheral countries, but they both are very much of interest to Francis,\u201d he said. \u201cHe believes that we need to look at the world from the peripheries to understand it, and there he goes.\u201dWhile he may be seeking to steer clear of politics, Francis will nonetheless be confronted with a major political shift in Sri Lanka upon his arrival.The pope\u2019s visit will start in Sri Lanka, where he is canonizing the Blessed Joseph Vaz, soon to be Sri Lanka\u2019s first saint, and meeting the local clergy as well as other religious leaders.In a first for a pope, he will visit Madhu\u2019s shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary, at the center of the former conflict zone of the bloody civil war between the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels and the Sri Lankan Army.Francis will then fly to the Philippines, the largest Catholic outpost in Asia, where he will celebrate a Mass and dine with survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Tacloban area in 2013. Vatican watchers anticipate that the pope will speak about environmental issues.Nonetheless, in his usually warm and humane fashion, Francis plans to have long car drives in five different open-air vehicles so that many people will be able to see him up close.\u201cTo me, the theme of an intercultural evangelization is crucial in this trip,\u201d Gian Luca Potest\u00e0, professor of the history of Christianity at Milan\u2019s Cattolica University, said in a phone interview.\u201cHe will canonize a local missionary, someone who made an effort to deliver the Gospel through local languages and cultures, careful to social justice and mercy,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is one of the pope\u2019s main messages \u2014 that Christianity is not based on ethnicity or identity, but is a universal peace factor.\u201dMany observers noticed how Francis is tracing the steps of Pope Paul VI, with his trip to the Holy Land and his recent meeting in Turkey with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople.The last papal trip to the region was in the 1990s, when John Paul II, the first pontiff to travel extensively all over the world, attended World Youth Day in the Philippines.\u201cFor a non-European pope it is easier to see the world and Christianity in a non-Eurocentric perspective, and easier for people all over the world to perceive him as such,\u201d said the Rev. Carlo Pioppi, professor of church history at Santa Croce University in Rome.\u201cHe understands and knows both cultures,\u201d he added, \u201cbut does offer a non-European vision sitting in Europe; this is his great strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Watchmakers Jolted by Currency Shock", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Geneva\u2019s annual luxury watch fair this week, Vincent Malissen was delighting in the intricacies of a gleaming timepiece from Vacheron Constantin, one of Switzerland\u2019s most prestigious watchmakers.The price starts at 288,000 euros.But when it came to confirming whether that pricing, equivalent to $334,000 at current exchange rates, would hold by the time the watch went on display next year, Mr. Malissen, a marketing manager for the brand, threw up his hands in a gesture of \u201cwho knows?\u201dThe currency shock has the Swiss companies especially perplexed because the country is the leading exporter of luxury watches and the sector was already feeling the effects of slowed sales to wealthy buyers in China and Russia, as well as competition from a new batch of smartwatches.The country, home to eight million, is also a top competitor in areas like pharmaceuticals, machinery and chemicals. With exports expected to dip, UBS, the Swiss bank, last week cut its growth forecast for Switzerland for this year to 0.5 percent from 1.8 percent.The Swiss National Bank for more than three years had pegged the franc to the euro mostly to protect Swiss exporters against a weakening of the euro. But the sudden reversal of the policy of preventing the franc from appreciating beyond \u20ac1.20 caused the currency to spike as much as 30 percent. It remained high this week, trading at about one franc per euro.The chorus of complaints against the central bank\u2019s U-turn was led by Nick Hayek, chief executive of Swatch Group, the world\u2019s largest watchmaker, who said last week the decision was \u201ca tsunami: for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.\u201dBut nowhere are the gyrations of the Swiss franc more directly felt than among the Swiss watch industry, which exports more than 90 percent of its timepieces while maintaining a largely domestic cost base because of its reliance on the appeal of a \u201cMade in Switzerland\u201d label. Switzerland recently toughened its label protection rules to ensure that at least 60 percent of the value of a Swiss product would be generated within the country.In the industry\u2019s most rarefied precincts, timepieces with highly complex movements that require years to develop and assemble can cost more than $2 million \u2014 even without diamonds. At Patek Philippe, \u200ba timepiece introduced in October to honor the brand\u2019s 175th anniversary has \u200ban esoteric chiming mechanism\u200b and a perpetual calendar; it took seven years to develop and costs $2.6 million. On the more modest end, a new Cartier model \u200bthat \u200bleaves the moving parts exposed and is housed in a ghostly 47-millimeter case of 18-karat white gold, start\u200bs at\u200b $150,000.Even before the franc\u2019s rise, watchmakers faced other challenges. Based on preliminary estimates, the worldwide sales growth of Swiss watches tapered to around 2 percent last year, compared with 22 percent in 2010.Much of that slowdown has occurred in China, which accounted for about two-thirds of the sales growth in the past decade. A clampdown on gift-giving, as part of an anticorruption drive by the Beijing government, has coincided with recent unrest in Hong Kong, a major retailing hub for Swiss watches.At the same time, recent political sanctions against Russia weakened the ruble and Russians\u2019 purchasing power. In recent months, shares in Swatch also fell over concerns about pending competition from Apple and other makers of smartwatches.Last week, Richemont, parent to brands like Cartier, Vacheron Constantin and Piaget watches, reported that sales rose almost 4 percent to \u20ac3.05 billion in its fourth quarter. The announcement, however, was eclipsed by the Swiss currency shock, which sent Richemont shares plunging 16 percent that day and a further 7 percent on Friday. Shares in Swatch also slumped, although both companies this week recouped a small part of their stock market losses.Even if the mood was less ebullient at the watch show in Geneva this year than in past years, executives insisted it was too early to calculate the impact of a stronger franc on earnings.Some sounded defiant. Alain Bernard, president of the Americas for Van Cleef & Arpels, said the company had \u201cno plans to change anything,\u201d as far as the pricing of watches was concerned. \u201cAt least when we get tired of talking about watches, we\u2019ll have something else to talk about,\u201d he joked.Other watchmakers pointed out that deep-pocketed buyers of luxury watches rarely focused on pricing.\u201cWhen you set a watch at, say, $600,000, the fact that you come to $650,000 or $680,000 doesn\u2019t change much,\u201d said Richard Mille, founder and chairman of the Richard Mille brand. \u201cI\u2019m not going to create myself any headache that I don\u2019t deserve.\u201dTo offset falling margins, Jean-Claude Biver, head the watchmaking division of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, predicted in a telephone interview that Swiss watchmakers would raise prices on average 3 to 5 percent, \u201cbut nothing comparable to the franc\u2019s rise against the euro.\u201dThe currency upheaval could also cause further consolidation in a sector already dominated by three groups. In 2008, LVMH acquired Hublot, as part of its efforts to diversify and challenge the two giants of the watch industry, Swatch and Richemont.\u201cWe\u2019re now going to have to sail through the kind of storm from which the stronger and larger companies typically emerge stronger while the weak ones get weaker,\u201d Mr. Biver said. Richemont, for instance, said last week that it had more than $5 billion in cash.Indeed, some smaller watchmakers said the central bank\u2019s decision had an immediate impact. Some retailers canceled orders within hours, Edouard Meylan, chief executive of H. Moser, a family-owned company that sells 95 percent of its watches outside Switzerland, wrote in an open letter sent to Thomas Jordan, the president of the Swiss National Bank.\u201cWhat for a larger company is perhaps a problem of having to deal with unhappy shareholders is for a company like ours a huge shock and closer to a question of survival,\u201d Mr. Meylan said by phone. \u201cIn one second, we lost two years of efforts to improve our margins.\u201dLarry Pelzel, an executive from Neiman Marcus, said the American luxury retailer was not placing orders during the Geneva fair. \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until the dust settles,\u201d he said.Like others, Mr. Biver, the LVMH executive, criticized the Swiss central bank\u2019s \u201cdoublespeak,\u201d after the bank repeatedly pledged to maintain its euro peg. \u201cWe now have at least learned to take whatever our bankers promise with a pinch of salt,\u201d he said.But Mr. Biver also expressed confidence in the resilience of the Swiss economy.\u201cThe degree of trust in our central bank has been lowered,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we should also not forget that our currency problem comes not because of something going wrong within Switzerland but because of the weak euro.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Musicians, a TV Series Underscores Diminishing Role ", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNestled among the zany plotlines of the Amazon series \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d are scenes that many classical musicians will recognize of the struggles, and indignities, that they face as they try to make it in New York.But one scene \u2014 of musicians in a studio recording an over-the-top score for a low-budget film \u2014 threatens to be a bit anachronistic these days. Soundtrack recording work for American musicians has grown scarcer in recent decades, as technological changes and competition from cheaper overseas orchestras have disrupted the industry.The changed environment was evident in the making of the Amazon series: In some scenes its stars, and the real orchestra musicians who were hired to portray members of the fictionalized New York symphony that the series revolves around, mimed playing their instruments to bits of Mahler and Berlioz that were recorded for the show in Bratislava, Slovakia. Other music, including an orchestral arrangement of the rock song \u201cLisztomania,\u201d was recorded in Los Angeles.The trend has been developing for years, and is traced in the 2005 book that the Amazon series is loosely based on: \u201cMozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music,\u201d a tell-all memoir by Blair Tindall that recounts her misadventures as an oboist in New York.Ms. Tindall wrote that in the 1980s, when she began playing on soundtracks, they were important sources of income for musicians. \u201cThe money was so good, several members of the New York Philharmonic quit their contracted positions to play only recording gigs,\u201d she wrote. But by 1991, after playing on the soundtrack of Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cMalcolm X,\u201d she recalled that \u201cjobs like this were few and far between \u2014 and rapidly becoming scarcer.\u201dTino Gagliardi, president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians in New York, said in a statement that there was a \u201cmassive problem of production companies offshoring recording jobs that should go to our large pool of talented local musicians.\u201dThe music in \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d comes from various sources. In addition to the Los Angeles studio musicians and the members of the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra, some of it was previously recorded and licensed for the show and some was recorded by Roger Neill, the series\u2019s composer, in his studio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Stimulus Calls for 60 Billion Euros in Monthly Bond-Buying", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would begin buying hundreds of billions of euros worth of government bonds in an aggressive \u2014 though some say belated \u2014 attempt to prevent the eurozone from becoming trapped in long-term economic stagnation.The bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said the central bank would begin buying bonds worth 60 billion euros, or about $69.7 billion, a month. That is more spending than the \u20ac50 billion a month that many analysts had been expecting.As a further stimulus step, the European Central Bank also said on Thursday that it was cutting the interest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks, as long as the banks commit to lending that money to companies or individuals. The new rate would be 0.05 percent, down from 0.15 percent.\u201cWe believe the measures taken today will be effective,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference.Financial markets greeted the news favorably. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50-stock index was up 1.6 percent, with financial firms\u2019 shares among the gainers, on hopes that the bond buying will spur growth and lending. Bond yields in some eurozone countries hit new lows, including countries that might benefit most from the central bank\u2019s program. The yields on 10-year government bonds in Italy dropped to 1.56 percent and in Spain to 1.39 percent.The euro, which had already been near its lowest level in 11 years on expectations of action by the central bank, weakened further against the dollar, falling about 1 percent to around $1.14, a move that could help European exporters.Top officials of the central bank had signaled clearly that a quantitative easing program was in the offing. But there remained, before the central bank meeting on Thursday, many questions about how large the program would be and whether it would be powerful enough to reverse a two-year decline in inflation.The European Central Bank sometimes appears to be the sole eurozone institution seeking to restore the economy, in the absence of government spending stimulus. In contrast to the stronger recoveries of the United States and Britain, the bloc\u2019s gross domestic product has still not regained its levels from before the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. Demand and credit demand remain feeble, and the unemployment rate has not dipped below 11 percent since early 2012.And so the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility is on the line. The policy announced on Thursday comes more than six years after the Federal Reserve undertook its first quantitative easing program in 2008. Indeed, in what has long been seen as a major blunder that worsened the problem, the European Central Bank actually raised interest rates in 2011.If successful, quantitative easing would push down market interest rates in the eurozone and make it easier for businesses and consumers to borrow money, helping to stimulate the economy and restore inflation. Quantitative easing could also have a psychological impact, helping to raise expectations that inflation will begin to rise and thus encourage people to spend now rather than wait.Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the bond buying would continue through September 2016 or \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.\u201dThe decision to begin buying government bonds on the open market came after a debate that lasted months. Mr. Draghi sought to overcome resistance from German members of the governing council and the broader German public, which regards quantitative easing as a form of wealth transfer to countries like Italy.Mr. Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that there had been intense discussion by the bank\u2019s Governing Council about how to share the risk if a country later defaults on its debt. Mr. Draghi said that concerns about risks being transferred from some countries to others was legitimate. The compromise preserves some risk sharing, he said.Asked if the Governing Council had voted unanimously to enact the new policy, Mr. Draghi hedged. \u201cThe meeting was unanimous in stating that the asset-purchase program is a true monetary policy tool,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was a large majority on the need to use it now,\u201d he added, such that \u201cwe didn\u2019t need to take a vote.\u201dThe European Central Bank will coordinate the buying, Mr. Draghi said, but will delegate some of it to the central banks of the various euro zone countries. In a further compromise, some of the risk from bond buying will be taken by the European Central Bank and some by national central banks.Anticipating critics who might say that the European Central Bank is not in full control of the eurozone\u2019s monetary policy if it shares the risk of its program, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cThe singleness of monetary policy remains in place.\u201dHe said that the central bank would begin buying government bonds based on each country\u2019s share of the central bank\u2019s capital, which is commensurate with their population and gross domestic products.He said that the central bank would not buy more than 33 percent of any country\u2019s outstanding bonds, nor more than 25 percent of any bond issue. The central bank will buy the bonds on the open market, he said, to allow the market to set the price. Those conditions appear intended to address legal challenges to bond buying by the central bank.Asked about Greece \u2014 a special case because of the political uncertainties there and because the country continues to labor under an international bailout program overseen in part by the European Central Bank \u2014 Mr. Draghi said that the bank could buy Greek bonds. But in practice, he noted, such purchases might be limited.Greece, he said, would have to continue adhering to the terms of its bailout program, which is also being administered by the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. That adherence is currently uncertain, as Greece awaits national elections this weekend that could result in a new government\u2019s seeking to revise the terms of the bailout.In addition, the European Central Bank already owns a large proportion of Greek bonds and would not hold more than 33 percent of the total. But in July, Mr. Draghi said, redemptions of Greek bonds could allow the central bank to buy more.Greek politicians seized upon those statements for their own purposes.Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist party Syriza, has been a critic of the current government\u2019s willingness to hew to austerity budgets required by the bailout program. In a statement, Syriza adopted a government-in-waiting stance, saying that the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying plan was an \u201cimportant decision, which the next Greek government will use for the benefit of the country.\u201dBut in a televised address later on Thursday, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, noted that a review of Greece\u2019s economic reforms by the country\u2019s creditors must be completed if Greece is to be included in the Draghi bond-buying program.Mr. Samaras ridiculed Syriza\u2019s welcoming of Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement, saying the leftists, who oppose the terms of Greece\u2019s loan program, \u201cclearly do not know what\u2019s going on.\u201dIn another crucial provision of the European Central Bank\u2019s program, the bank would have equal status to other bond holders \u2014 rather than holding itself above other investors and expecting to be paid back first in the event of problems. That will be important to private investors, because if the central bank held itself out as a privileged bondholder, effectively passing more risk on to other bond holders, other buyers might undermine the stimulus program by demanding higher interest rates.Although the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England used quantitative easing to rejuvenate their economies, such a program would be more complicated in the eurozone. There is no widely traded, Pan-European government bond similar to United States Treasury securities, which were the main vehicle for the Fed\u2019s program.Another question is whether quantitative easing can help fix the eurozone economy, especially since it has taken so long for the central bank to begin a large-scale bond-buying program. Many economists and businesspeople are skeptical.\u201cI do not believe bond buying or whatever is the remedy,\u201d Karl-Ludwig Kley, chairman of Merck, a German pharmaceutical and chemicals company that is separate from Merck & Company in the United States, said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cI do not see, because of these programs, consumers buying more. I do not see companies investing more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haiti\u2019s Economic Aftershocks", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGRAND GOAVE, Haiti \u2014 Five years is an eternity in the news cycle of natural disasters. It\u2019s been that long since the 2010 Haiti earthquake killed hundreds of thousands of people (no one really knows how many died) and triggered an influx of international aid (an exact accounting remains elusive). Haiti\u2019s trauma has been eclipsed by Oklahoma tornadoes, Pacific typhoons and New York hurricanes. The world moves on.Over the last five years, working as an architect here on reconstruction projects, I\u2019ve witnessed some physical and social recovery. But the disheartening reality is that Haiti\u2019s post-quake economy is identical to its pre-disaster model: Haitians remain dependent on foreign donations to maintain their subsistence existence. NGOs with tunnel vision and international aid agencies with top-down agendas hobble the weak government and cite Haiti\u2019s culture of corruption as an excuse to deny distributing aid through local channels. Economic autonomy is not disaster relief\u2019s primary objective. But Haiti will be a global stepchild until it makes something people want to buy.Different countries have relative economic strengths. The United States fosters innovation, China excels at production, but Haiti barely participates in the global economy. Yet as a low-wage country close to the world\u2019s largest consumer market, it offers advantages. Shipping goods from Haiti is a bargain because containers importing humanitarian aid often leave here empty. Its annual exports are about a third of neighboring Jamaica and less than half of its African cousins Mali and Senegal.Yet Haiti faces big impediments to becoming a successful exporter of manufactured goods. A history of unstable governments and restrictive policies on foreign investment keep multinational corporations away. Convoluted bureaucracies and corruption make business transactions difficult. An unreliable workforce impedes efficiency.Haiti has survived as an insular country since 1804, after a revolution by slaves brought independence from France. Since then, its revolving-door governments have inconsistently invited and spurned foreign investment. Corporate and political distrust still run strong, and this extends to humanitarian efforts. Less than one percent of earthquake-disaster relief and only 15 percent of reconstruction projects have been channeled through the Haitian government.Over the last five years I\u2019ve witnessed how these problems cripple the country. I designed and supervised construction of an orphanage and school in Grand Goave, 15 miles west of the quake\u2019s epicenter. Both projects, the largest reconstruction efforts in Grand Goave, used American volunteers and paid Haitian crews to construct quake-resistant buildings adapted from Haiti\u2019s traditional concrete construction. We were fortunate to have a Haitian-based organization coordinate land acquisition, road access and the few approvals required.But obtaining raw materials was difficult. After the earthquake, prices spiked for items like steel reinforcing. Other materials, like cement, simply couldn\u2019t be found. Specialties, from construction tools to shower curtains, had to be imported from the United States. Delivery times were erratic. A truckload of electrical panels and fixtures delivered to the Port of Miami at the end of May arrived in Haiti just before the American Labor Day weekend in early September, only to be slapped with an arbitrary customs fee.Exporting goods from Haiti is not any easier. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports the time required to process goods for export is more than 24 days, the longest in the Western Hemisphere. Products from Thailand have much further to travel, but they can get to the United States much faster.The biggest impediment I witnessed to Haiti becoming economically viable is the struggle to create consistent quality on a predictable schedule. Some days we were able to pour 30 cubic yards of concrete by hand bucket in six hours; other days we labored into the night and fell short of that result. My business experience provided little guidance for this dilemma, but a book by the historian Laurent Dubois offered insight. In \u201cHaiti: The Aftershocks of History,\u201d he describes the operation of so-called lakou, small-scale cooperatives that bundled land ownership and production to circumvent government attempts to create export-scale agriculture and reap the resulting tariffs.The Haitian penchant to thwart \u201cthe man,\u201d whether French slave owners or greedy presidents, U.S. Marines or paternalistic aid organizations, is more than an economic gambit; it\u2019s a point of pride. Haitians do not work for money alone. They cherish their independence above all. Their pride in being the first black republic is so palpable one might think they achieved freedom 10 years ago, not 210 years ago.I learned the only way to get things done was to make our objectives align. Sometimes that meant reminding the men that ours was a community effort; sometimes it meant pitching in to erase the line between labor and management. Nothing motivates Haitians more than \u201ctrumping the blan\u201d (the Creole word for foreigner). Often this meant doing consciously silly things, such as teetering on a scaffold to demonstrate their superior balance.Our school and orphanage are welcome additions to the community, but a town with orphanages and no factories is still a place of dependency. Yet no aid agency or private concern is introducing manufacturing to Grand Goave.Haiti needs to create a unique economic model, a 21st-century lakou that bypasses a top-down system in favor of small enterprises multiplied many times over. This is already happening, albeit on a tiny scale. During my first year working in Haiti, I searched online for Haitian-related holiday gifts. There was nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 for sale from Haiti. Now there are dozens of sites offering goods produced here. Although they consist mostly of nonprofit organizations selling crafts, they\u2019ve contributed to the 3-to-4 percent growth in Haiti\u2019s gross domestic product every year since 2012.This trend can expand if the government improves the environment for entrepreneurs: Make it easier to establish small businesses; smooth transportation obstacles; devote less effort to seeking large corporations; nurture local resources.There\u2019s little to lose. NGO\u2019s and aid organizations have improved conditions, but they are often poorly coordinated and lack the scope to propel self-sufficiency. The government is widely perceived as being hobbled by corruption. It needs to demonstrate a new honesty and transparency; capitalize on the NGO presence by coordinating their work, monitoring their progress and directing their vision. Well-coordinated aid could lead to a new, decentralized, economic model. When that occurs, all sorts of interesting things will rise out of Haiti. Including something I\u2019ll want to buy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Pocketing What They Save on Gas, Retail Data Suggests ", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExecutives were feeling bullish early this week at the nation\u2019s biggest retail trade show. James Curleigh, president of the Levi\u2019s brand, crooned the Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolution\u201d in front of hundreds of his peers at a packed New York convention center. Robert B. Harrison, an executive at Macy\u2019s, boasted that his company was set to surpass Netflix to become the seventh-largest online retailer in the country. Kip Tindell, the Container Store\u2019s chief executive, declared retailing \u201cthe greatest occupation there is.\u201dThen on Wednesday the Commerce Department struck a far gloomier note.The decrease, far worse than economists\u2019 median forecast of a decline of 0.1 percent, followed a smaller-than-expected gain of 0.4 percent in November. The weak spending numbers could prompt economists to be more pessimistic in their outlook for economic growth this year.The headline figure for December is misleading because it includes gasoline prices, which are sliding. Once gas and automobile sales are excluded, retail spending fell 0.3 percent, but even that dip still suggests consumers saved the extra money instead of spending it. Economists had expected sales excluding gas and autos to jump 0.5 percent.Sales in electronics stores and at clothing and department stores fell in December\u2019s broad retreat. One factor weighing on consumer sentiment has been wage growth, which has been sluggish despite falling unemployment.\u201cWe had a very conflicted consumer this holiday season,\u201d said Steve Barr, United States retail and consumer sector leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. He said lower-income households still struggled to spend more despite the lower gas prices, because any money saved was offset by cost-of-living increases. Sluggish wage growth continued to limit demand, he said.\u201cRetailers responded with a much earlier start to the holiday season and heavy promotions,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cNow you worry whether they\u2019ve permanently conditioned the consumer to expect deep discounts.\u201dNonstore holiday sales, an indicator of online purchases, grew 6.8 percent to $101.9 billion, according to the federation.\u201cThere is every reason to believe that we have moved well beyond the days of consumer pessimism and that the trajectory for retailers continues to point up,\u201d said Matthew R. Shay, the trade group\u2019s chief executive.Analysts also warned against reading too much into short-term data.\u201cThe American consumer is fickle, and if we\u2019ve learned anything over the past few years it\u2019s that it\u2019s dangerous to read a long-term trend based on a couple of months of data,\u201d said Chris Donnelly, senior managing director for retail at Accenture Strategy.\u201cThe overall tailwinds the economy has are stronger than the past two years, and those should help drive continued growth,\u201d he said.Another bright spot in the retail data was spending at restaurants and bars, which the Commerce Department said rose 0.8 percent compared with November, suggesting that Americans used their gasoline savings to eat out more often, rather than shop.Food and beverage stores, as well as pharmacies and other health and personal care stores, also had higher sales in December. And compared with the same month last year, overall retail spending grew 3.2 percent, the data showed, with gains in all retail categories except department stores and gas stations.Full-year figures for consumer spending painted an even more upbeat picture, with retail sales rising 4 percent in 2014 compared with the previous year, led by an almost 9 percent surge in auto sales. Spending on building materials and home furnishings also increased significantly, reflecting strong home sales. Shoes and clothing purchases, together with electronics sales, managed growth of under 3 percent for the year.\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer. It\u2019s going to be a better year for the consumer in 2015,\u201d Paula Campbell Roberts, a consumer analyst at Morgan Stanley, said before the data\u2019s release. She said that lower gas prices alone had brought consumers a windfall of $50 billion in the fourth quarter, and that they could expect $80 billion more in the first quarter.\u201cThat\u2019s income that\u2019s not having to be devoted to putting gas in our gas tanks and we can spend elsewhere,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s true that wage growth has been sluggish,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we know that with each passing month, labor markets are getting tighter.\u201d She said she expected wages to grow at an average clip of about 2.5 percent in 2015, slightly faster than the 2 percent logged last year.Some retailers have fared better than others. Family Dollar said last week that its same-store sales dropped 0.4 percent in the final quarter, despite analysts\u2019 projections of healthy gains. The company added, however, that comparable sales for December rose 1.2 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, Tiffany & Company said that same-store sales over the holidays dipped 1 percent, a result the jeweler\u2019s chief executive, Michael J. Kowalski, called \u201cdisappointing overall.\u201dStill, Urban Outfitters said holiday sales rose a robust 4 percent, while they rose 3.7 percent at J. C. Penney and 2.7 percent at Macy\u2019s. RetailMetrics, which tracks retail sales data, said it estimated that fourth-quarter earnings at the 122 retailers it tracks grew a steady 7.5 percent.\u201cConsumers\u2019 real disposable cash flows are surging, confidence is high and rising, and the labor market is recovering at an astonishing rate,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. \u201cThere is no reason to think the dip in the core is anything other than noise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Central Bank Cuts a Key Rate ", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Forecasting a major economic slowdown in the face of lower oil prices, the Bank of Canada unexpectedly cut its key lending rate on Wednesday.The central bank reduced the overnight rate to 0.75 percent, from 1 percent. It is the first rate change since September 2010.The move comes as Canada deals with the consequences of lower oil prices, which are now around $48 a barrel. In recent weeks, domestic companies have announced a flurry of spending cuts and layoffs. As a result, the Bank of Canada now predicts that the economy will grow at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the first half of the year. That is down from a previous estimate of 2.5 percent for the period.But Stephen S. Poloz, the bank\u2019s governor, did offer a potential bright spot.The lower value of the Canadian dollar, another byproduct of low oil prices, and the improving economy in the United States will help bolster the export-dependent manufacturing sector. After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the Canadian dollar hit 81 cents against the American dollar, compared to 91 cents a year ago.\u201cIt\u2019s a setback but in a story that\u2019s coming together nicely and positively,\u201d Mr. Poloz told a news conference, in which he said that Canada had \u201ctwo economies\u201d that were heading in opposite directions.Canada\u2019s fortunes are quickly shifting.In recent years, high oil prices and the investment they attracted turned Western Canada, particularly the province of Alberta, into the nation\u2019s economic engine.But many manufacturers in Ontario and Quebec suffered because of the weakness in the American economy.Last week, Joe Oliver, Canada\u2019s finance minister, said that the turmoil in Canada\u2019s economy would delay the presentation of his next budget until at least April. Normally federal budgets are presented to Parliament before the government\u2019s fiscal year closes at the end of March.The big uncertainty for Canada is just how long oil prices will stay low. The central bank is predicting that prices will stabilize at $60 a barrel later this year.Others are less optimistic. Arlene Kish, an economist with IHS Global Insight in Toronto, said the central bank\u2019s forecast relied too heavily on a rebound in oil prices, as well as an improvement in nonenergy exports.That combination, she wrote, \u201cputs Canada\u2019s household sector and energy-producing regional economies in a precarious position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Primer in House Sitting", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI am living the life of the rich and famous, although I am neither.I\u2019m following good weather and my whims around the country, moving from one luxury home to another. My accommodations last year have ranged from a mansion in Washington, D.C., around the corner from the home of former Senator John Glenn, to a woodsy retreat in Chapel Hill, N.C., to a sprawling Philadelphia condo with an exclusive Rittenhouse Square address.At the moment, I\u2019m living in a hillside house in Santa Barbara, Calif. The scarlet bougainvillea, attended by hummingbirds, competes for sunlight with the lavender blooms of jacaranda trees and spiky purple agapanthus in the garden. The Pacific is an indigo wedge on the horizon. I\u2019ll swim a few lengths of the pool \u2014 no suit needed \u2014 before showering in a spa-like master bath with heated floors. For these two months, I\u2019m driving a vintage white Mercedes nicknamed the Sugar Cube.My cost for living in this Southern California splendor? Nothing. I tend three cats, feed a tank of fish and mist the Boston ferns in return for lodging. I\u2019m a house sitter, part of a thriving network of full- or part-time vagabonds.House-sitting is one more example of the upending of the travel industry by the combination of social networking and the sharing economy. The difference between house-sitting and companies like Couchsurfing \u2014 in which the person who owns the home is paid \u2014 is that no cash is exchanged. Neither I nor the homeowners I sit for spend any money.I started house-sitting inadvertently, when an acquaintance in Santa Barbara wanted someone to mind her cats for two weeks. She had tapped out her family connections. I was already spending four to six weeks of every winter and summer \u2014 when the weather in St. Louis is either lethally cold or horrifically hot \u2014 in California, so I jumped at the chance. We\u2019ve repeated the arrangement every year since, with the length of her vacations, and mine, gradually growing. That got me wondering about other house-sitting opportunities.I listed my availability on Craigslist; no response. I considered contacting universities, looking for professors going on sabbatical, but that seemed like a lot of trouble. Eventually I Googled \u201chouse-sitting\u201d and found several websites that registered \u00adhomeowners and house sitters. They cost between $10 and $100 a year for membership, which gives you access to the listings.Homeowners post descriptions of their homes and pets, as well as the dates they need a sitter, anywhere from a weekend to several months. Potential sitters provide a brief profile, any house-sitting experience, contact information and references. Reading the listings is like being addicted to gumdrops: Do I want three weeks in a house with a horse in Brittany, or a month in Costa \u00adRica on an estate overlooking the Pacific Ocean?Why, you may ask, would anyone entrust their home and possessions to strangers?Some homeowners, especially those who will be gone a significant amount of time, just want their houses occupied as a security measure (statistically, an occupied house is safer than one left empty). That was the case for my stay in Washington. I arrived just after the last snowstorm, in April, and left before the onslaught of summer.But pets are the reason for 80 percent of house-sitting arrangements, said Andy Peck, the founder of TrustedHouse\u00adSitters.com, who started out house-sitting on a multimillion-dollar estate in Spain.\u201cPeople want their pets to be comfortable, in their own environment,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the sitter\u2019s point of view, there are a lot of people who genuinely love looking after pets, especially while having a \u2018staycation\u2019 and enjoying luxury, sometimes decadent luxury, while living like a local in a fantastic place. It\u2019s a win-win for both sides.\u201dSo far, I\u2019ve cared for cats, some fish and one dog. I get a lot of laughs reading the descriptions of required pet care, from clipping the nails of 13 indoor cats to nursing a diaper-wearing, diabetic dog through his final days while his owners jet off to Costa Rica. One homeowner sought care for \u201c4 horses, 2 dogs, 8 cats and a pet pig who lives in the house, in addition to chickens and ducks and 2 very friendly goats.\u201dAs for the trust issues, the websites don\u2019t make any matches or vouch for the accuracy of the listings. It\u2019s up to sitters and owners to find one another through the listings, then vet one another by exchanging emails, talking by Skype or telephone and, in some cases, meeting in person. The sites strongly encourage sitters to post references and even undergo police background checks. They provide sample agreements spelling out the responsibilities of both parties.Retiring baby boomers and workers in the freelance economy who, like me, can do business anywhere with a laptop and a smartphone make up the primary supply of house sitters. Families looking to take interesting vacations during school holidays are another source. (Homeowners specify whether their property is suitable for children, and many encourage families.) The same groups are often looking for house sitters themselves.There are risks on both sides of the arrangement. Besides theft or damage, there\u2019s the possibility that sitters will cancel at the last minute, ruining expensive travel plans. Sitters, too, may face the unexpected. A friend of mine agreed to move into a Victorian house in Colorado for a month, only to find that one of the two dogs she\u2019d be watching was a snarling hound of the Baskervilles.My only mishap was being caught skinny-dipping \u2014 twice \u2014 in Santa Barbara. The Guatemalan pool guy unexpectedly changed his schedule so he could watch the World Cup. At least I was in the deep end.Last year, I sold my house and unmoored myself from any one location, to indulge my wanderlust for a year. I\u2019m already booked through February. I\u2019ve had to pass on that house with the Pacific Ocean view in Costa Rica, a month in Boston\u2019s Beacon Hill and a cottage in the Cotswolds. I\u2019m beginning to think that a year might not be long enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Generation of Adoptees Is Returning to South Korea", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLaura Klunder\u2019s newest tattoo runs down the inside of her left forearm and reads \u201cK85-160,\u201d a number that dates to her infancy. Klunder was 9 months old when her South Korean mother left her at a police station in Seoul. The police brought her to Holt Children\u2019s Services, a local adoption agency, where a worker assigned Klunder the case number K85-160. It was only two weeks into 1985, but she was already the 160th child to come to the agency that month, and she would go on to be one of 8,800 children sent overseas from South Korea that year. Klunder became part of the largest adoption exodus from one country in history: Over the past six decades, at least 200,000 Korean children \u2014 roughly the population of Des Moines \u2014 have been adopted into families in more than 15 countries, with a vast majority living in the United States.Klunder, who is 30, has a warm goofiness and a tendency toward self-deprecation. (\u201cI was the chubby kid with glasses wearing Lisa Frank T-shirts,\u201d she said, shaking her head at the memory of her middle-school self.) But she also resonates intensity. She chose the tattoo of her case number as a critique of adoption, she told me. \u201cI was a transaction. I was a number in the same way that people who are criminalized and institutionalized are given numbers.\u201dKlunder, who was raised in Wisconsin, moved back to South Korea in 2011, which is where I met her one night last February along with three of her friends, all adoptees from the United States. We were at a restaurant in the Hongdae section of Seoul, known for its galleries, bars and cheap restaurants. Outside, the streets teemed with university students, musicians, artists and clubbers. The neighborhood is also a popular spot for the approximately 300 to 500 adoptees who have moved to South Korea \u2014 primarily from the United States but also from France, Denmark and other nations. Most lack fluency in the language and possess no memories of the country they left when they were young. But they are back, hoping for a sense of connection \u2014 to South Korea, to their birth families, to other adoptees.Over time, ASK backed away from its message of ending adoption. It was too polarizing, adoptees said, and \u201chard for people to hear anything we said after the word \u2018stop,'\u2009\u201d Jenny Na, one of the group\u2019s founders, wrote in a history of ASK. But in recent years, members \u2014 along with other Korean adoptee activists \u2014 have built an improbable political campaign, lobbying for legislation that has helped reduce the flow of Korean children overseas. In the process, they have emerged as leaders in a movement to question the very concept of international adoption, one that has galvanized other adoptees around the world.Some of those leaders, including Klunder and her friend Kim Stoker, who was also at dinner that night, want to stanch the flow of Korean children entirely. \u201cI get parents\u2019 desperation to have children,\u201d said Stoker, who at 41 was the oldest of the group at the table. \u201cAccepting diverse families is great,\u201d she said. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal adopting a child from another country, of another race and paying a lot of money. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal to put a child on a plane away from all its kin and different smells. It\u2019s a very modern phenomenon.\u201dNeither Klunder nor Stoker believes international adoption will stop in South Korea any time soon. But ending it is what they want. As Klunder put it, \u201cOur goal is to make ourselves extinct.\u201dDuring the \u201950s, most children available for adoption were of mixed race \u2014 \u201cthe dust of the streets,\u201d as they were called \u2014 whose fathers were American and U.N. soldiers. Some of them had turned up at orphanages, lost or abandoned; in the postwar chaos, it was unclear if their parents were still alive. But in other cases, mothers relinquished their mixed-race babies because they feared that their families would be treated as outcasts.By the 1960s and 1970s, the country had industrialized and urbanized rapidly; divorce and teenage-pregnancy rates climbed. Poor and working-class single women with babies struggled with little, or no, support from the government. Most of the children placed for adoption at the time were fully Korean. In the meantime, the number of babies available for adoption in the United States in the 1970s dropped, as birth-control was more readily available, abortion was legalized and single motherhood became more socially acceptable.South Korea, by this point, had passed the Special Adoption Law, which created a legal framework for adoptions and approved four agencies to process those adoptions. From the beginning, though, there were problems. Adoption paperwork was sometimes fraudulent \u2014 a grandmother or an aunt might give up a baby without the mother\u2019s consent (while she was working or looking for work), because they thought the mother and the child would be better off. Agency workers often didn\u2019t verify information \u2014 about a child\u2019s health or age, or whether the mother had truly consented to adoption \u2014 in order to expedite the process. Eleana Kim, associate professor of anthropology at the University of California, Irvine, and author of \u201cAdopted Territory: Transnational Korean Adoptees and the Politics of Belonging,\u201d explained that though most women weren\u2019t directly paid, adoption agencies set up homes for unwed pregnant women and took care of medical expenses with the expectation that the women would agree to have their babies sent overseas. Workers at adoption agencies sometimes told mothers that they would be selfish to keep their children, who would thrive in affluent, two-parent households in the United States. In the 1980s, adoption became big business, bringing millions of dollars to Korean agencies. The government benefited, too. For each child South Korea sent away, it had one fewer child to feed.By 1985, the year Klunder arrived in the United States, South Korea had earned the reputation as the Cadillac of adoption programs because of its efficient system and steady supply of healthy babies. The number of adoptions reached unsettling heights, with an average of 24 children leaving South Korea each day. The continued growth was all the more striking because South Korea\u2019s economy had improved significantly. That year, its G.D.P. ranked 20th globally, just below Switzerland\u2019s, and continued to climb over the next decade. During NBC\u2019s coverage of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when the world saw a newly democratic country lined with skyscrapers and freshly paved highways, Bryant Gumbel noted that South Korea preferred to keep quiet about its \u201cexportation\u201d of babies. North Korea also criticized its neighbor for its liberal adoption policies.Embarrassed, the South Korean government promised to reduce international adoptions, in part by providing subsidies and extra health care benefits to South Korean families who adopted. But the government showed far less interest in helping single mothers keep their babies.People in the United States, meanwhile, began adopting from all over the world. Though only 7,000 children were adopted into the United States in 1990, by 2004 \u2014 the peak of international adoption \u2014 that number had risen to 23,000, with children arriving from China, Russia, Guatemala, South Korea, Ukraine, Colombia, Ethiopia and dozens of other countries.I was among that wave of adoptive parents. After several miscarriages, my husband and I adopted two children \u2014 one domestically, one internationally. We chose domestic adoption initially because we longed for a newborn and wanted an open adoption, in which children and birth families can remain in contact. (Studies suggest that open adoption \u2014 far more common in the United States than in international adoptions \u2014 is psychologically more healthful for adoptees and birthparents.) In 2003, our older daughter, who is part Japanese and part African, was born in California, where we lived.But by the time we signed up to adopt again a couple of years later, my husband and I were in our early 40s, and we feared that another domestic adoption could take years. Instead we looked to Guatemala, where adoptions often occurred more quickly and most children lived in foster homes, receiving more one-on-one attention than in orphanages. Unlike in China and many other countries, in Guatemala, adoptive families could also meet birth families during the process and stay connected afterward through photos, letters and visits.I began scouting agencies with the most ethical reputations. I heard repeatedly \u2014 though mostly from agencies and other parents \u2014 that there were safeguards (DNA tests of mothers and children; social-worker interviews with birth mothers) to protect adoptive and birth families. But almost as soon as I arrived at the Westin Hotel in Guatemala City to finalize the adoption of our daughter, I felt queasy. Everywhere, it seemed, there were lawyers and agency representatives handing over brown-skinned babies, born to impoverished mothers, to white, wealthy parents \u2014 some of whom might never return to Guatemala again, who might make no effort to encourage a link between their adopted children and their country or their birth families. My husband and I were eager not to be \u201cthose parents.\u201d When the adoption was complete, instead of leaving the country, we drove with our daughters to a nearby city, where we spent several days. One night at a restaurant, a well-dressed Guatemalan man in his 50s or 60s passed my new daughter and me and muttered, \u201cThere goes another baby taken from our country.\u201dHis comment might have referred to corruption: It would become increasingly clear that Guatemala\u2019s adoption system was, like those in Ethiopia, Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere, plagued with illegal payments, coercion of birth mothers and in some cases outright stealing of babies. (Guatemala\u2019s program shut down seven years ago.) Or maybe he was thinking about the fact that birth mothers, typically indigenous women who faced discrimination, had little access to counseling and no official waiting period after birth during which to change their minds. He may have been imagining what would happen if the thousands of dollars each family handed over to their adoption agency was used instead to help children stay in Guatemala. And then there was the issue that Kim Stoker has since raised: Should adopted children be brought up by people of a different race?\u201cNo parent wants their child to be discriminated against,\u201d Stoker told me one night in Seoul. \u201cBut I think as a white parent in a white society \u2014 even if you\u2019re in a multicultural neighborhood \u2014 you can\u2019t protect your child when your child walks out the door. You provide all these economic resources, but there are all these other things that you haven\u2019t experienced as a white person.\u201dMy husband and I are of a generation that is supposedly savvier and better educated about raising adopted children. We have done some of the \u201cright things\u201d: traveled with our kids back to Guatemala and to Japan (where my older daughter\u2019s birth mother lives). We\u2019ve advocated for open adoptions (with mixed success) so our daughters would have access to their records and contact with their families. Our daughters\u2019 friends and their school are diverse. And my husband and I try not to shy away from talking about the complexities of adoption and race.Amy Ginther in the Gangnam district of Seoul.Still, my daughters don\u2019t see themselves reflected in my and my husband\u2019s faces. They will confront racism in their lives, which neither my husband nor I ever have. My children are happy and deeply attached to us. But while the predominant narrative of adoption focuses on what is gained, each adoption also entails loss for both the child and her biological family. It\u2019s a loss I can\u2019t fully know and one I can never entirely heal.Perhaps that\u2019s what the Guatemalan man meant when he saw me with my daughter. I had love and financial advantages to offer her. But she was yet another child who, through no choice of her own, was leaving her biological family, her country and her culture behind.In Franklin, Wis., a largely white suburb of Milwaukee, Klunder attended a Lutheran school where she was taunted by one boy for years: \u201cWhy is your skin so dirty?\u201d \u201cYou look like a black Barbie.\u201d \u201cDid you fall in the mud?\u201d Her parents had good intentions and, Klunder says, \u201cwere loving in more ways than they were not.\u201d But they didn\u2019t acknowledge how central race was in their daughter\u2019s life. \u201cMy parents told me they didn\u2019t see color,\u201d Klunder said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t engage on that level.\u201dWhen I recently talked to her mother, she said: \u201cI could see how upsetting certain things were to Laura. But I said, \u2018You can\u2019t let these things bother you so much; there will also be people like that in the world.'\u2009\u201d When the issue of adoption came up, Klunder\u2019s mother told her that her birth mother loved her very much but that God had a different plan for her. As a teenager, furious that her parents didn\u2019t understand her feelings and experiences, Klunder repeatedly lashed out at them. They were angry, too. When she was in high school, Klunder told me, her father would say: \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for this. Send her back.\u201d (He says he remembers saying something like that only once.)This was in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when adoption experts had already shifted from telling parents to \u201cassimilate\u201d their adopted children, instead encouraging them to talk openly about adoption, to acknowledge racial differences and to embrace their children\u2019s birth culture. Some parents signed up for \u201chomeland tours\u201d to Korea or sent their children to Korean summer \u201cculture camp,\u201d where kids gathered in the woods of Minnesota or California to study the Korean alphabet, dance to Korean pop music and learn taekwondo.In a 2009 survey of adult adoptees by the Donaldson Adoption Institute, more than 75 percent of the 179 Korean respondents who grew up with two white parents said they thought of themselves as white or wanted to be white when they were children. Most also said they had experienced racial discrimination, including from teachers. Only a minority said they felt welcomed by members of their own ethnic group. The report recommended that parents do more than just celebrate multiculturalism or sign up for culture camp. Adoptees should have \u201clived\u201d experiences related to adoption and race: traveling to birth countries, attending racially diverse schools. Those things might have helped, Klunder says, but only if she had parents who were willing to be honest about racism. \u201cYou need parents who can talk about white privilege, who can say: \u2018You might experience some of this. I\u2019m sorry. We are in this together.'\u2009\u201dIn college, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Klunder found a group of like-minded friends and joined the multicultural student coalition. After receiving a master\u2019s degree in social work, she took a job at Macalester College in Minnesota, advising minority and feminist groups and working on the school\u2019s response to sexual assault. Her immersion in those issues served only to make fights with her parents more disheartening. \u201cI knew that I was the only person of color in their life, and it was too easy for them to invalidate my point of view as another \u2018anger issue.'\u2009\u201d At some point, she said, \u201cI felt hopeless to create change in my adoptive family.\u201dEight years ago, she stopped talking to them, though she says she hopes that will change one day. Her mother, who misses her daughter, said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for anything we didn\u2019t do correctly for her. But we didn\u2019t know how she felt. I couldn\u2019t get her to talk about anything important or what was inside her.\u201dIn the summer of 2010, when Klunder was 26, she went to Seoul to join more than 500 other Korean adoptees from around the world for an annual event known as the Gathering. For many \u2014 some of whom never had Korean adopted friends before \u2014 it was a heady experience. They ate together, drank together; some stumbled back late at night into hotel rooms together. They spoke in shorthand about their American lives, sharing their stories about being told by strangers that their English was very good and about meeting men who assumed that Asian women were up for anything in bed.Over the year that followed in Minneapolis, Klunder was anxious about her impending move to a country where she had no friends, no employment and no fluency in the language. Still she quit her job and said goodbye to the boyfriend she loved (\u201can anti-racist white man,\u201d as she described him). She packed one large suitcase with clothes and two carry-ons with shoes, handbags and books, including works by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Saul Alinsky, Bell Hooks, along with South Korean adoption memoirs. Then she flew back to her birth country on a one-way ticket.Like many before her, Klunder spent some of her early days at KoRoot, an adoptee-only guesthouse in Seoul with cheap rooms and communal meals, run by Pastor Kim Do-hyun, along with his wife, Kong Jungae. At the two-story brick-and-stone house, Kim encourages new arrivals not only to explore Seoul but also to think about the larger political issues around their adoptions. In the \u201990s, as a pastor in Switzerland, Kim began working with adoptees after one committed suicide, leaving a note that said, \u201cI\u2019m going to meet my birth mother.\u201d Later, as a grad student in theology, Kim wrote his master\u2019s thesis on birth mothers.In 2008, Kim and his staff from KoRoot joined forces with the organization Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea and one of its founders, Jane Jeong Trenka, to try to amend South Korea\u2019s adoption law to help discourage overseas adoption. Kim and Trenka, who was raised in rural Minnesota and returned to South Korea in 2004 to be closer to her birth family, spent three years meeting with public-interest lawyers, government officials, nonadoptee activists and a member of Parliament, Choi Young-hee, who agreed to sponsor the amendment. ASK and two other groups, Dandelions (a group of Korean birthparents who had placed their children for adoption) and Kumfa (an organization for single mothers), joined the effort as well. They lobbied government officials, wrote and rewrote the proposal\u2019s language and drew attention to their cause by installing a piece of artwork in a government building, featuring 60,000 hanging paper price tags inscribed with a number representing each Korean adoptee.In August 2012, they succeeded in enacting an amendment to the adoption law, implementing curbs on adoption that would have seemed unthinkable decades ago. Women must now receive counseling and wait seven days before placing a child for adoption. All adoptions must be registered through the courts, which gives adoptees, who often struggle to make contact with their families (only a small percentage of Korean adoptees who search for birth families ever find them), an avenue for tracing their history.Detractors say the law now creates too many hurdles for women who genuinely want to put their babies up for adoption and slows the process. Since the law was passed, the number of abandoned babies has increased \u2014 though whether that\u2019s a direct result is unclear. They also note that Koreans are generally not comfortable \u201craising another\u2019s child,\u201d as Koreans say, and finding adoptive families can be difficult. (Some Korean families who are willing to adopt keep it a secret.) Adoption supporters in the United States and elsewhere question the very idea of making adoption more restrictive around the world, especially in deeply impoverished countries, where birth control and abortion are taboo and there is little government will to help children, including those who languish in orphanages.For better or worse, the amendment seems to be having its desired impact in South Korea: Adoptions to other countries, already on the decline since the 1980s \u2014 hovering around 1,000 a year between 2007 and 2012 \u2014 dropped to 263 in 2013. The activists also see the amendment as an acknowledgment that their views matter. \u201cThe law incorporates the opinions of the people actually affected \u2014 adoptees, unwed mothers,\u201d said Trenka, who is 42 and now a mother herself; she and her partner, Luke McQueen, a 43-year-old Korean adoptee from Colorado, have a 3-month-old daughter. \u201cAnd it\u2019s proof that Korean adoptees can be taken seriously and effect change.\u201dFor Trenka and other Korean activists, their engagement with these issues extends beyond Korea\u2019s borders. In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Trenka publicly warned that adoptions from Haiti were vulnerable to the same sorts of problems \u2014 fraudulent paperwork; children designated as orphans when their parents were alive \u2014 that existed in postwar Korea. Kim Stoker joined other adoptees from around the world issuing a statement protesting the \u201cfast tracking\u201d by the U.S. government of Haitian adoptions.More recently, Trenka, along with Vietnamese, Indian, Ethiopian and Colombian adoptees, criticized a bill before the United States Congress last year that aimed to make international adoption easier. They argued that adoptees were not consulted about the bill and said \u2014 along with Holt International Children\u2019s Services, which publicly opposed it \u2014 that it would eliminate adoption safeguards and reallocate foreign aid from international programs that help children.Trenka has also met with activists from other countries, including Jenna Cook, an adoptee from China. Last year, she came to South Korea for a conference and talked to Trenka about adoptee rights. A recent graduate of Yale, Cook is one of more than 100,000 children adopted from China since the early \u201990s, the second-largest group of international adoptees. She and other adoptees want the Chinese government to respond the way South Korea has and offer F-4 visas so they can return for the long term. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we are recognized as a diaspora,\u201d Cook says. \u201cWe are going to come back as highly educated middle-class Europeans and Americans, with brain power and economic capital.\u201dWhile some Chinese adoptees are now in their 20s, those from other countries tend to be much younger. Since the late 1990s, roughly 29,000 children from Guatemala and 14,000 from Ethiopia have been adopted into the United States. Most of them have yet to reach high school. Compared with Korea \u2014 a democracy and a developed country \u2014 Guatemala, China and Ethiopia may prove less welcoming, at least for now. But as adoptees grow up, Korean activists hope that they will demand more information about their histories and the adoption process from agencies and governments. Perhaps cities like Beijing, Antigua in Guatemala or Addis Ababa in Ethiopia \u2014 already popular destinations for adoptees and their families \u2014 may become their own mini-adoptee communities and centers of activism against international adoption.At the barbecue dinner, Benjamin Hauser said he shared this view. \u201cI understand there could be potential problems with adoption, but I know positive cases too.\u201d Hauser, who is 36 and has lived in South Korea since 2004, is a manager at an English-language school and is writing a children\u2019s adventure book featuring Korean adoptees. Unlike many adoptees, he remembers his early life in South Korea: He lived with a foster family for five years and spent two years in an orphanage before being adopted by a couple in Rochester. His parents then adopted two more boys from South Korea.Throughout their childhood, he and his brothers had a fairly diverse group of friends, and their father, a professor of Japanese history, cooked Korean food and took the kids to Korean restaurants. At the end of high school, when his parents asked Benjamin if he would like to go to Paris or Seoul for his graduation, he picked Paris. \u201cI grew up as an American,\u201d said Hauser, who wears a small earring and has spiked hair that juts out in several directions. \u201cMy parents are Caucasian. I didn\u2019t identify as Korean. I wasn\u2019t mature enough to realize I could explore that side.\u201d Before moving to Seoul, he never had an Asian girlfriend. \u201cIt was part of my feeling of wanting to be white.\u201dTen years ago, when he was working as a manager at Otis Elevator Company in Albany, he realized \u201cthis job would be the rest of my life \u2014 and something was missing.\u201d He remembered his goal when he was in the orphanage \u2014 to return to the dairy farm where he lived with his Korean family. (He later learned that it was his foster family; he has never found his birth family.)But he feared that searching for his Korean roots was a betrayal of his adoptive parents. \u201cI thought they might say, \u2018We were the ones who took care of you; why do you feel like you need to look for your foster family?'\u2009\u201dEleana Kim, the author of \u201cAdopted Territory,\u201d says it\u2019s a common anxiety among adoptees who often dread \u201ccoming out\u201d to their parents \u2014 whether it\u2019s in the form of birth-family searches, returning to birth countries or criticizing the adoption system.In Hauser\u2019s case, his parents were not upset. \u201cI was mostly worried that he might get hurt,\u201d his mother, Susan Hauser, told me, referring to adoptees who can\u2019t find their families or discover the families don\u2019t want to be found. \u201cBut he was an adult, and it was his decision.\u201d She and her ex-husband also supported his move to South Korea. Benjamin\u2019s father, William Hauser, said: \u201cI understand how parents feel it\u2019s a rejection, but I don\u2019t feel it at all. In a sense I\u2019m much closer to him since he\u2019s been in Korea.\u201d He and Susan Hauser are in a tiny minority of parents who visit their children each year \u2014 their son Zack also lives in Seoul, where he\u2019s a chef.Instead it was Benjamin\u2019s middle brother, Aaron, who was offended \u2014 at least at first \u2014 by how much his brother loved South Korea. \u201cI thought Ben\u2019s Korean pride diminished his American pride,\u201d he told me recently. That changed when Aaron visited Seoul, took Korean classes and hung out with Benjamin\u2019s friends. He realized that spending more time there made him feel \u201cmore Korean,\u201d and that was gratifying.Though Benjamin and his brothers feel close to their parents, many adoptees told me that closeness isn\u2019t the only relevant issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about me and my personal experience,\u201d said Amy Mihyang Ginther, a voice coach who wrote and starred in a one-woman play that she performed in Seoul and other cities, taking on personas of adoptees and birth mothers.Growing up near Albany, Ginther attended playgroups with other Korean adoptees and culture camp, which she loved. When Ginther was bullied in school \u2014 kids called her Chinese and Japanese and said her parents couldn\u2019t be her \u201creal\u201d parents \u2014 her adoptive mother came to speak to the class about Korean culture and adoption, with Amy as her co-teacher. But her love for her parents didn\u2019t keep her from longing to connect to her birth family and to South Korea. In 2004, she reunited with her birth mother (her adoptive father came with her on the trip). Then two years later, she visited again, living with her birth family for a month. (Her Korean mother was so protective, she barely let her outside the house.) In 2009, she moved to South Korea and has lived there on and off since. Ginther, who is 31, now sees her birth mother about every other month in Seoul or in her birth mother\u2019s hometown, Gimcheon, a couple of hours south of the city.Adoptees, of course, also had no choice, and many resent the idea that they should simply be grateful \u2014 that they are somehow better off than they otherwise would be. As Trenka writes in her memoir, \u201cThe Language of Blood\u201d: \u201cHow can I weigh the loss of my language and culture against the freedom that America has to offer, the opportunity to have the same rights as a man? How can a person exiled as a child, without a choice, possibly fathom how he would have \u2018turned out\u2019 had he stayed in Korea? How many educational opportunities must I mark on my tally sheet before I can say it was worth losing my mother? How can an adoptee weigh her terrible loss against the burden of gratitude she feels she has for her adoptive country and parents?\u201dLovell, who is 36, teaches English to elementary-school children and is a graduate student working on a documentary about adoptees returning to South Korea. She grew up in Ipswich, Mass., and has lived in Seoul for six years. She has an advantage over many adoptees: She speaks Korean fairly well, which makes her feel more at home. But like every other adoptee, she has had to adjust to different social norms, including Koreans\u2019 well-intentioned bluntness, especially when it comes to women: How old are you? Are you married? Are you tired? Why don\u2019t you wear more makeup?Lovell doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be willing to raise children in South Korea, with its hypercompetitive school system. In addition, many women told me that they may leave because of the dearth of romantic partners. Male adoptees have it easier \u2014 they are seen as more masculine than they are in the United States \u2014 and live in a \u201cfrat culture,\u201d as one woman told me, filled with drinking and a wide choice of women: adoptees, other expats and \u201cKorean Koreans,\u201d as native Koreans are called.Lovell was one of the very few female adoptees I heard about with a Korean boyfriend. He\u2019s a musician who tells her he is \u201cnot a typical Korean guy.\u201d Still, \u201che scolds me, saying, \u2018You should be doing this,'\u2009\u201d she said, imitating a paternal voice. Laura Klunder also pointed out the various ways gender roles are ingrained in daily life: Female adoptees are often viewed as masculine when they wear clunky shoes and carry their own bags of groceries \u2014 a sharp contrast to the young Korean women in high heels, short skirts and meticulously applied layers of makeup. Koreans also consider it unladylike for women to smoke in public. And if a handyman arrives at a woman\u2019s apartment to fix something, he will often ask to speak to the husband. \u201cIn the U.S., I feel my race,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cHere I feel my gender. This is what it must have been like in the United States during the \u2018Mad Men\u2019 era.\u201dFor many adoptees, those cultural divides \u2014 coupled with the fact that they can\u2019t speak the language, a frustrating and often heart-wrenching obstacle in their own birth country \u2014 solidifies the feeling that they hover in between: not fully American, not fully Korean. Instead, they live in a third space: Asian, Western, white, adopted, other. It\u2019s a complicated place but not always a bad one. \u201cI am, maybe, in a way, proud of my in-betweenness,\u201d Lovell recently wrote me in an email.It is a space I expect my children will share with Lovell, and with so many other adoptees. Both of my daughters\u2019 birth families and their roots tug on their hearts. If they eventually decide to live in the countries of their birth mothers for a year or five years or more, I hope to support \u2014 even encourage \u2014 them. If living there fills some void, creates some peace, fosters a sense of belonging, how could I not want that for them?In the years ahead, I also expect my kids will have tough questions for me. Perhaps they will ask why my husband and I thought we were equipped to raise a child of a different race. My youngest may ask why we chose international adoption. Did we understand its failures? Did we do anything to fix them?I hope to answer without defensiveness \u2014 and with candor and empathy. I hope, too, that I remember two things may be true simultaneously: Our daughters\u2019 love for us and their need to question why and how we became a family.An article on Jan. 18 about children adopted from South Korea misspelled the name for Korean karaoke. It is noraebang, not nori bong. The article also described incorrectly an art piece created in conjunction with a lobbying ef ort to change Korean government regulations on adoption. The installation featured paper tags stamped with a number representing each adoptee, not with their names. And the article referred incorrectly to one adoptee\u2019s upbringing in the United States. Kim Stoker was raised in Colorado and Virginia, not in Utah.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Republicans Change Rules on Calculating Economic Impact of Bills", "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After the drama of electing a new speaker of the House and the changing of control in the Senate, the House on Tuesday approved an obscure but significant rule change requiring the economic effects of legislation to be included in a bill\u2019s official cost to the Treasury.\u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018If you think a piece of legislation is going to have a big effect on the economy, then include that effect in the official cost estimate,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cSo if you think a bill is going to help or hurt the economy, then tell us how much.\u201dDemocrats blasted the change as \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d a \u201cgamble\u201d and \u201ctax fraud.\u201d Opponents said the rule change would invite politicized scorekeeping, further tilt policy to benefit the rich, and expand the budget deficit. Shaun Donovan, the White House budget director, implored the House not to \u201cupend the level playing field that has existed for decades\u201d and \u201ccall into question the accuracy, consistency and fairness\u201d of congressional budget estimates.\u201cThe basic problem remains that macroeconomic work is useful in the laboratory but not in the field,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a longtime chief of staff at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which officially tallies the cost of tax proposals. \u201cThe models are too simplistic and the range of the possible outcomes so great that it opens the process to too much in the way of political intuitions.\u201dSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and an opponent of the change, said he expected the Senate to follow suit, although Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new majority leader, has not unveiled his slate of rule changes yet. Even without a Senate change, the House has the authority to order the new scoring procedure.The House rules package also continues the chamber\u2019s special investigation into the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, as well as its lawsuit against President Obama. But no change has been sought for so long or engendered more debate than mandatory dynamic scoring.\u201cI thought we might go a day without the kind of hyperbole we\u2019ve grown used to,\u201d Mr. Price said of the Democrats\u2019 responses. He called the naysaying \u201cnonsense.\u201dUnder the rule change, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office will have to consider the budgetary effects of economic growth, employment, investment income and \u201cother macroeconomic variables\u201d when calculating the official price tag of \u201cmajor legislation\u201d \u2014 defined as any bill expected to cost at least 0.25 percent of the gross domestic product, or about $42 billion using figures from 2013.The House Budget Committee chairman would have the discretion to declare any other tax or entitlement bill \u201cmajor\u201d and thus subject to dynamic scorekeeping. The measure would not apply to economic stimulus bills favored by Democrats, such as infrastructure or education bills paid for by spending at Congress\u2019s annual discretion.Proponents described the change as modest. Few bills will qualify for such scoring, and past studies of dynamic scoring have shown only limited changes to the projected costs of legislation.\u201cThis strikes me as very sensible,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former C.B.O. director who priced the cost of a budget under President George W. Bush using a normal scoring model and one that took into account economic impacts. That exercise showed that expected growth from Mr. Bush\u2019s proposed tax cuts would be offset by increased spending on prescription drugs for Medicare recipients.The real impact of the change might be determined by the people crunching the numbers. Last year, when Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who was the Ways and Means chairman before his retirement, drafted a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, the Joint Tax Committee tried to price the plan by taking into account its impact on the economy.One estimate suggested economic growth would shave $50 billion off its cost over 10 years, said Ed Lorenzen, a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a deficit watchdog group. Another estimate put the savings at $700 billion. To get that number, Mr. Lorenzen said estimators had to assume that the federal debt would remain stable against the gross domestic product. In other words, there would be undisclosed cost savings in the future.Not surprisingly, Mr. Camp chose that estimate when he unveiled his plan.With so much uncertainty, the importance of the new rule is likely to be determined by the next C.B.O. director, whom Republicans will appoint in the coming weeks. Emerging names range from partisan Republicans to centrists with bipartisan support.\u201cThe hope is by choosing a particularly sympathetic C.B.O. director, the dynamic scoring as implemented will take the rosiest possible interpretations, models and assumptions to produce the most dramatic results,\u201d Mr. Kleinbard said, expressing Democrats\u2019 biggest fears.Mr. Holtz-Eakin scoffed. When he moved from his role as an economist at the Bush White House to C.B.O. director, Democrats feared the worst, just as Republicans feared the appointment of Peter R. Orszag, a Democratic favorite, to the post. The office did not turn partisan in either case.\u201cNo C.B.O. director would ever do that,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThat\u2019s at odds with any notion of history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, he will end the visit early and fly to Riyadh, the Saudi capital that is in the midst of a leadership transition.The New York Times would like to hear from readers in India about what President Obama\u2019s visit means to you.The president will \u201coffer his condolences on behalf of the American people,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThe president regrets that he will be unable to visit Agra during this trip,\u201d Mr. Earnest added, referring to the home of the Taj Mahal.Mr. Obama released a statement on Friday lauding King Abdullah for his efforts to bring peace to the region and to improve education in Saudi Arabia.\u201cAs our countries worked together to confront many challenges, I always valued King Abdullah\u2019s perspective and appreciated our genuine and warm friendship,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAs a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions. One of those convictions was his steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond.\u201dThe United States has depended on Saudi Arabia for decades as a reliable friend in the region and supplier of much-needed oil, at one point sending hundreds of thousands of troops to the kingdom to defend it against a possible threat from Iraq when it was led by Saddam Hussein. Even when the relationship was challenged by the country\u2019s ties to Al Qaeda terrorists involved in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Washington worked hard to preserve the bond, seeing the royal family as a bulwark against instability.More recently, Saudi Arabia has sent warplanes to join the Obama administration\u2019s new military campaign against the terrorist group Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. And while surging American oil production has made the United States less dependent on Saudi petroleum, the kingdom\u2019s ability to shape world events was reinforced when it opted against cutting production, resulting in a sharp drop in the price of oil. That in turn has helped undercut the economies of Russia and other energy producers.Mr. Obama has not often flown to other countries to pay his respects after the deaths of their leaders. One of the few exceptions was his decision to attend the state memorial for Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, who died in 2013.Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to cancel his visit to the Taj Mahal, where the first lady, Michelle Obama, had been scheduled to accompany him, will reduce some of the symbolic weight of his trip to India. But Mr. Obama will still be the first American president to visit India twice while in office, following a trip in 2010, and on Monday he will be the first American leader to serve as chief guest at India\u2019s annual Republic Day celebration, which is the anniversary of the day that India\u2019s Constitution became the country\u2019s governing document in 1950.Advertisement"}

A bagpipe and drum corps in plaid and leopard skin. Sikh regiments in dress turbans, their starched fringes fanning out like gold lam\u00e9 pie plates. A formation of combat helicopters that thudded past, releasing drifts of marigold petals.On one level, of course, it was just a parade. But it served as a fitting geopolitical metaphor as well. Russian-made Sukhoi-30 fighter jets roared over, so low that the scent of jet fuel settled over the V.I.P. section, and Russian-made T-90 tanks trundled by, a reminder of India\u2019s ties to Moscow dating to the Cold War.\u201cThe crowd is getting understandably excited and ecstatic at the arrival of the motorcade of the president of the United States, Barack Obama,\u201d the parade announcer said when Mr. Obama\u2019s Cadillac pulled up. At that point, a military policeman in a red-fringed turban gestured sternly for spectators to remain seated, but they ignored him completely, scrambling atop their chairs for a view. Two men unfolded a banner that read \u201cI \u2665 Obama.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s presence required extensive security preparations, as he has not spent such a long stretch outdoors in public in a foreign country during his six years in office. As is typical for outdoor events, he was seated behind bulletproof glass shields. Indian security was so tight that ballpoint pens were confiscated from reporters covering the parade.Republic Day is a major holiday in India, commemorating the day in 1950 when the post-partition democratic Constitution came into force. Seats are provided for 125,000 people, according to the Defense Ministry, which arranges the event. Spectators began streaming through the streets toward the parade ground at dawn, some wrapped in wool blankets against the chilly rain. Though elaborate, snaking barriers had been erected along the routes leading to the site, the crowds quickly spilled over them and surged into the road.\u201cI came because of Obama,\u201d said Vinay Kumar, 32, who had woken at 4:30 a.m. to catch a bus from his home on the city\u2019s outskirts. \u201cWe hope he and Modi together will help grow the economy. And help us to get H-1B visas to visit America.\u201d\u201cI am not looking for a permanent visit,\u201d he added, \u201cjust one year or two.\u201dMany said they came out of pride. Indian crowds adore military spectacle, a fact that British colonial powers recognized in the 19th century, adopting the fabulous displays of the maharajahs who preceded them. George Curzon, the British viceroy, at one point \u201cissued instructions that European officials were not outshined by the Indian princes who came wearing their jewelry,\u201d said Rana China, who heads the Center for Armed Forces Military History in New Delhi.\u201cThe colonial state was of the view that the Indian people loved a parade, loved pageantry, and they wanted to give it to them,\u201d he said. \u201cPomp, pageantry, all of this \u2014 they are symbols of power.\u201dFor all his socialist leanings, India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, retained those flourishes when he introduced the Republic Day parade, in addition to a display of heavy weaponry directed toward Pakistan. As members of a Sikh regiment passed on Monday, swinging their arms so vigorously that they seemed in danger of dislocating them, the announcer remarked in a tweedy British accent that \u201cthis regiment has the reputation of creating terror among the enemy.\u201dMonday\u2019s parade included all-women contingents from the army, navy and air force. Mr. Obama seemed particularly impressed by a display of motorcycle trick-riding, showing a thumbs-up. There were also many reminders that India has been the world\u2019s largest consumer of Russia\u2019s arms industry, particularly after a series of flyovers by MIG-29 and Su-30 fighter jets.Mr. Obama and the American delegation have made it clear they want to compete for India\u2019s defense dollars, renewing the defense pact between the two countries on Sunday and agreeing to cooperate on aircraft carrier and jet engine technology. They also agreed to work on joint production of small-scale surveillance drones.That did not mean that Russia was about to cede a lucrative, longtime market. Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, made a point of visiting last week, just before Mr. Obama arrived, to discuss joint production of a light utility helicopter and to resolve disagreements about a long-delayed fifth-generation fighter aircraft.But as he left the parade on Monday, Sunil Mudgal, 39, an army officer, said he saw India\u2019s relationships beginning to shift, in part because the United States\u2019 \u201coutlook toward the neighboring countries, especially Pakistan, has changed.\u201d\u201cTen years back, we were only reliant on Russia,\u201d he said. That morning, added his wife, Anuradha, the couple\u2019s young son could think of nothing but Mr. Obama, who was seated across the parade route from the family. \u201cHe asked me,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2019If I wave to him, will he see me?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most Republicans Say They Back Climate Action, Poll Finds", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a finding that could have implications for the 2016 presidential campaign, the poll also found that two-thirds of Americans said they were more likely to vote for political candidates who campaign on fighting climate change. They were less likely to vote for candidates who questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming.Among Republicans, 48 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports fighting climate change, a result that Jon A. Krosnick, a professor of political science at Stanford University and an author of the survey, called \u201cthe most powerful finding\u201d in the poll. Many Republican candidates question the science of climate change or do not publicly address the issue.Nonetheless, 47 percent of Republicans still said they believed that policies designed to curb global warming would hurt the economy.Although the poll found that climate change was not a top issue in determining a person\u2019s vote, a candidate\u2019s position on climate change influences how a person will vote. For example, 67 percent of respondents, including 48 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of independents, said they were less likely to vote for a candidate who said that human-caused climate change is a hoax.This nationwide survey asked people for their views on whether global warming will be beneficial or detrimental, about how the president and Congress have responded to it, and what they believe government should do about it.The results came as climate change was emerging as a source of debate in the coming presidential campaign.But those positions appear to be out of step with the majority of the electorate.The poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans and 86 percent of independents, say that if nothing is done to reduce emissions, global warming will be a very or somewhat serious problem in the future.But substantial differences remain between the two parties on the issue.Democrats are much more likely than Republicans or independents to say that the issue of global warming is important to them. Among Democrats, 63 percent said the issue was very or extremely important to them personally. In contrast, 40 percent of independents and only 18 percent of Republicans said the same.And while the poll found that 74 percent of Americans said that the federal government should be doing a substantial amount to combat climate change, the support was greatest among Democrats and independents. Ninety-one percent of Democrats, 78 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans said the government should be fighting climate change.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Jan. 7 to 22 with 1,006 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.An overwhelming majority of the American public, including nearly half of Republicans, support government action to curb global warming, according to the poll.A majority of Americans \u2014 71 percent \u2014 expect that they will be personally hurt by climate change, although to different degrees.\u201cSome people think they\u2019ll be really devastated; some people think they\u2019ll be inconvenienced,\u201d Mr. Krosnick said.Jason Becker, a self-identified independent and stay-at-home father in Ocoee, Fla., said that although climate change was not his top concern, a candidate who questioned global warming would seem out of touch.But he said of climate change: \u201cIf someone feels it\u2019s a hoax, they are denying the evidence out there. Many arguments can be made on both sides of the fence. But to just ignore it completely indicates a close-minded individual, and I don\u2019t want a close-minded individual in a seat of political power.\u201dPolitical analysts say the problem for many Republicans is how to carve out a position on climate change that does not turn off voters like Mr. Becker, but that also does not alienate powerful conservative campaign donors. In particular, advocacy groups funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch have vowed to ensure that Republican candidates who support climate change action will lose in primary elections.\u201cIt recruits more Tea Partyers than it repels,\u201d Mr. Krosnick said.A pledge to fight climate change appears to have less attraction for older voters. The poll found that older Americans were slightly less inclined to support a candidate who calls for action to reduce global warming and similarly less negative toward a candidate who rejects the premise of global warming.\u201cGlobal warming hasn\u2019t much importance to me,\u201d said William Werner, 73, a retired sales manager in San Antonio. \u201cIt is not man-made in my opinion because there have been cycles forever, and we can\u2019t do much about that.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf you\u2019re speaking about voting for someone in this country who says they can take actions that will affect global warming, I don\u2019t believe it, because we are just not that big a polluter compared to other countries.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Washington, and Marjorie Connelly from New York.

{"Headline": "Portrait of Iran, Where Revolution Is Ideological and the Costs Are Human", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesNazila Fathi\u2019s account of the turbulent years she spent in Iran as a child, a woman and a professional journalist is a personal story. But like most memoirs written by Iranian women in the last few decades, this personal story is intertwined with traumatic events \u2014 revolution and war, loss and betrayal. Ms. Fathi, who served as a reporter for The New York Times in Iran for nine years, was born in 1970 into a secular upper-middle-class family in Tehran. After the revolution that overthrew the shah, the family\u2019s lives were changed forever as a result of \u201cthe metamorphosis of the society\u201d around them. Her father, who worked in the Ministry of Energy, lost his job within a year and worked in his orchard to earn money. As the Islamic dress code became obligatory, Ms. Fathi and her sister, Goli, faced the tyranny of a \u201cmorality\u201d teacher at school who tried to mold them into ideal Muslim girls. The author remained steadfastly critical through it all. \u201cTo feel human,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe needed to retake control of our minds as well as our bodies. We waged the war on both fronts.\u201dShe studied English at Azad University and became a translator for foreign journalists. In 1992, she accompanied Judith Miller of The Times to a campaign event, and it was then, she says, that \u201cthe journalism bug bit me.\u201d In 2009, the huge uprising known as the Green Movement erupted from those protesting what they saw as vote tampering. Ms. Fathi and visiting Times journalists covered many of the protests and reported on the violence by the authorities against peaceful demonstrators. Defying a ban on covering the protests any further, Ms. Fathi was under surveillance at her home and tailed by government agents; her life was threatened. She, her husband and two children left Iran in June 2009. \u201cThe Lonely War\u201d is divided into the personal, political and social history of three decades, from 1979 to 2009. In short and lucid chapters about each period, Ms. Fathi conveys the experiences of people from different walks of life and intersperses these accounts with observations about how the new Islamic revolutionary ideology was conceived, anticipated, received and resisted. In her view, there have been intended and unintended consequences of revolutionary policies in this turbulent era. \u201cThe revolution is evolving,\u201d she says, and she is right.Ms. Fathi is sometimes on shaky historical ground, especially before the revolution. (For example, the National Front coalition was secular, not religious nationalist.) Nor was it, as she implies, only the modernization programs of the Pahlavi dynasty that created anger and resentment among traditional groups and toppled the shah. It was also the accompanying political repression, censorship, cronyism and bad economic and cultural policies, which the author underestimates, that alienated the modern middle class along with the poor. The book\u2019s portrayal of the violence against dissidents after the revolution, the isolation of Iran during the American hostage crisis of 1979-81, and the traumatic war with Iraq (1980-1988) is precise and poignant. And this account is especially good regarding the state\u2019s efforts to control women. \u201cOur bodies became battlefields,\u201d Ms. Fathi writes. \u201cThe Islamic regime was intent on controlling every dimension of our lives, and we were determined to resist.\u201d But the Islamic state\u2019s report card is not all bad. Ms. Fathi is fair in discussing the government\u2019s focus on improving the living standards for the urban and rural poor, including the delivery of electricity and water, and the construction of schools and universities. And she notes that while the Islamic laws restricted and discriminated against women, the Islamization of public space led more religious families to feel safe allowing their daughters and wives to go to school, to vote and to participate in the economy and society.After Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s death in 1989 and the emergence of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the religious leader and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as president, different factions began to emerge within the leadership. As a young translator and journalist, Ms. Fathi was exposed both to the mind-sets of hard-line clerics and young Basij militia recruits as well as to emerging voices of dissent, including those of disgruntled former revolutionaries. Ms. Fathi argues that as poor and more strictly religious women became more educated, the differences between their views on women\u2019s rights and those of secular women began to diminish. It was then that activists like Ms. Sherkat and Ms. Ebadi employed any available religious latitude to challenge the status quo and improve the legal circumstances of women. Such changes, in addition to higher levels of education for all and more access to information through technology, prepared the ground for the high voter turnout (80 percent) in the 1997 presidential elections and the victory of the reformist Mohammad Khatami. The kinder, gentler face of Mr. Khatami\u2019s government severely threatened hard-line factions, including Mr. Khamenei\u2019s. Ms. Fathi vividly describes how the broadly based reformist movement \u2014 particularly the student movement \u2014 was crushed and felt betrayed as the reformist leadership backed down to avoid a major confrontation with Mr. Khamenei. The violent crackdown of student demonstrations in the summer of 1999 showed that the directly elected bodies of the Islamic republic had far less power than the unelected bodies, which are religious. By the start of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s first term as president (2005), Ms. Fathi had been under surveillance by the Intelligence Ministry (which did not frighten her), the Revolutionary Guards (which did) and the unpleasant person of her children\u2019s nanny. But she bravely continued her reporting. For this period, as Iran\u2019s economic situation worsened, she provides an excellent account of rising tensions, intimidation and arrests in the run-up to the 2009 elections, and a harrowing description of the mass demonstrations that broke out once the result was announced prematurely. Ms. Fathi\u2019s book is a testament to her courage and to the brave struggles of many Iranians who continue to live there with patience, hope and determination. Considering that Iran now has a thriving civil society, vibrant youth and women\u2019s movements, and some political change with the election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013, perhaps hers isn\u2019t such a lonely war after all.THE LONELY WAROne Woman\u2019s Account of the Struggle for Modern IranBy Nazila FathiIllustrated. 297 pages.

Things have been looking up for a while, but at this point the signs of improvement \u2014 job gains, rapidly growing G.D.P., rising public confidence \u2014 are unmistakable. Well, that\u2019s their problem. What I want to ask instead is whether any of this makes sense. How much influence does the occupant of the White House have on the economy, anyway? The standard answer among economists, at least when they aren\u2019t being political hacks, is: not much. But is this time different?To understand why economists usually downplay the economic role of presidents, let\u2019s revisit a much-mythologized episode in U.S. economic history: the recession and recovery of the 1980s.The point is that normally the Fed, not the White House, rules the economy. Should we apply the same rule to the Obama years?Not quite.Last but not least, even if you think Mr. Obama deserves little or no credit for good economic news, the fact is his opponents have spent years claiming that his bad attitude \u2014 he has been known to suggest, now and then, that some bankers have behaved badly \u2014 is somehow responsible for the economy\u2019s weakness. Now that he\u2019s presiding over unexpected economic strength, they can\u2019t just turn around and assert his irrelevance.So is the president responsible for the accelerating recovery? No. Can we nonetheless say that we\u2019re doing better than we would be if the other party held the White House? Yes. Do those who were blaming Mr. Obama for all our economic ills now look like knaves and fools? Yes, they do. And that\u2019s because they are. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gas, Still Not as Cheap as It Used to Be", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuel for EconomyThe decline in gasoline prices over the past four months has been sharp and surprising. But for Americans wondering why their family budgets still feel strained, part of the answer is almost as surprising:Gas is not actually that cheap, at least not when compared with its level for much of the last 30 years.That era of cheap gas is easy to forget. Yet it offers a couple of important lessons about two of today\u2019s biggest economic (and political) issues: climate change and the great wage slowdown.That\u2019s why taking virtually every step to push oil costs even lower \u2014 \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d as the phrase goes \u2014 would make a lot of sense, so long as oil use did not have harmful side effects.The most obvious way to hold down the price of oil is to increase its supply. The earlier era of cheap gas was made possible by technological advances that allowed for a surge of supply in the 1980s from northern Alaska and Europe\u2019s North Sea. Mexico also became a major producer. The recent drop in oil prices, similarly, stems in part from supply increases in Iraq and Libya. Even more important has been the shale-oil boom (also known as the fracking boom.)More oil production, then, involves enormous trade-offs: a healthier economy, at least in the short term, but a less healthy planet, with all of the political, ecological, health and economic downsides that come with it.Is it possible to get the benefits of more energy production without the drawbacks? Yes, at least in part. Fracking is less carbon intensive than conventional oil drilling (though fracking brings other dangers that need managing). Clean energy \u2014 like wind and solar \u2014 would be better yet, if it could become even cheaper.Left to its own devices, the energy market will repeat this cycle. Low prices will cause supply to grow more slowly, both clean and dirty energy, and demand to grow more quickly. It\u2019s happening already.Advertisement"}

This could be because of its alliance with the French automaker Renault. If not, the French curves Nissan uses must come directly from the mother country.At first glance, all eyes laser in toward the flowing brightwork near the back. In an industry full of recycled, repurposed and outright stolen design elements, it\u2019s refreshing to see bold originality. The cowcatcher grille is a bit exuberant, but if the number of people who linger around the Murano in parking lots is any sign, Nissan has a hit on its hands.The cabin of the top-of-the-line Platinum model, done up in Mocha leather, looks as if it were destined for installation in an Infiniti, Nissan\u2019s luxury arm, at some point. This new trim level is aimed at Lexus, Cadillac and Acura, and darned if it doesn\u2019t come close.All the premium stuff is stuffed in \u2014 radar-assisted cruise control, panoramic glass roof, heated and cooled seats, a warmed steering wheel and Nissan\u2019s bird\u2019s-eye-view camera system that kept me from tangling with a large concrete block near the passenger side front quarter panel while backing out of a parking spot. Safety technology includes forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.The drivetrain is classic Nissan. A 3.5-liter V6 with 260 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque is Murano\u2019s only engine. Choose between front and all-wheel drive. Unsurprisingly, the transmission is a continuously variable unit with simulated gearshifts. Surprisingly, it feels much like a 6-speed gearbox. Kudos to Nissan: It has banished the rubbery droning dynamic.Murano moves, corners and stops in a way that neither thrills nor bores. Unlike its showy sheet metal, the driving dynamic is much like a highly disciplined assistant that is seldom noticed. Zero to 60 runs are a satisfying 7.5 seconds or so; no necks will be snapped. The drive was comfortable and quiet on a 200-mile road trip, and I came close to the Environmental Protection Agency-rated fuel economy of 21 miles per gallon city and 28 highway. That figure applies to both front- and all-wheel-drive models.The all-wheel-drive Platinum that I drove for a week retails for $43,745 including the destination charge. A tip: The base S model, at $30,445, gets you the same engine, transmission and concept-car attitude. It\u2019s a daring drawing that no one else has, and one the premium brands could learn from.

{"Headline": "In Greece, Banks Ask E.C.B. for Access to Emergency Aid", "Date": "2015-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 In a sign that political uncertainty in Greece has shaken the country\u2019s fragile economy, two of Greece\u2019s four main banks are seeking access to emergency funds from the European Central Bank, a Greek official said on Friday.Executives at Eurobank and Alpha Bank, the country\u2019s third- and fourth-largest banks, confirmed they were the ones making the request, citing \u201cpreventive\u201d reasons. Those acknowledgments followed a report in the daily newspaper Kathimerini that said the lenders had sought 5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, between them and that other banks were expected to make requests in the coming days.The banks\u2019 requests comes before Greek elections set for Jan. 25, when a change of government could cast new uncertainty on the country\u2019s ability to meet the terms of its international bailout program.Some \u20ac3 billion has been withdrawn from Greek banks in the last two months. Speculation in the Greek news media about a potential bank run prompted the country\u2019s central bank to say last week that the situation was under control.The Greek official, who is from the country\u2019s central bank and spoke on the customary condition of anonymity, said the banks\u2019 requests would be discussed by the European Central Bank, one of Greece\u2019s three international creditors, at its Governing Council meeting in Frankfurt on Thursday.The European Central Bank declined to comment on Friday.Officially, the type of aid being sought \u2014 known as emergency liquidity assistance \u2014 is the responsibility of national central banks in the eurozone, which also assume the risk if banks are later unable to repay the money. But national central banks are required to report to the European Central Bank when they grant assistance, and its Governing Council has the option to block the aid.Theoretically, emergency liquidity assistance can be granted only to banks that are solvent. But the European Central Bank faced criticism in recent years for allowing assistance to banks in Cyprus, for example, that later failed.Typically, banks turn to emergency liquidity assistance when they run out of assets, like government bonds that they can use as collateral to borrow money at more favorable rates from the European Central Bank. Greek banks already received such assistance in 2012.For the Greek banks, apart from an increased outflow of deposits as savers get jittery about the country\u2019s economic outlook, the lenders\u2019 liquidity has also come under pressure because of the previous government\u2019s frequent issuing of short-term debt that it leaned on the banks to buy.Greek banks have drastically reduced their borrowing from the country\u2019s central bank since June 2012, when the nation\u2019s debt crisis was threatening to force Greece from the eurozone. At that point, just before critical elections, the central bank\u2019s borrowing had reached around \u20ac130 billion.But Greek banks still rely on money from the European Central Bank, which in league with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, has extended Greece two bailouts worth \u20ac240 billion since 2010. Those loans were in exchange for a tough austerity program.But the money now being sought by the Greek banks would be classified as emergency liquidity assistance, which carries a much higher interest rate \u2014 1.55 percent \u2014 compared with the rate of only 0.05 percent for the European Central Bank\u2019s regular lending to commercial banks.The European Central Bank has warned that access to additional financing after the end of February, when the European part of Greece\u2019s foreign bailout program ends, will depend on the completion of suspended bailout talks with creditors.The prospects for those talks are unclear. The Greek leftist opposition party, Syriza, which is widely expected to win the Jan. 25 election, has said it will seek a renegotiation of what it considers onerous terms of Greece\u2019s bailouts. Government cuts have slashed Greek incomes by a third and pushed unemployment above 25 percent. Syriza has called for a partial write-down of the country\u2019s debt.The European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, has made clear that the absence of a deal between Greece and its creditors means no guarantee for central bank cash.Syriza has suggested that the country could avoid a cash problem by issuing short-term debt, for local banks to buy, and by accessing treasury reserves. But the Greek finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, has accused the leftists of complacency about the country\u2019s financial obligations.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

We are not going to do it.\u201dWinning the authority would allow Mr. Obama to finish and gain swift approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sprawling pact that his administration has been painstakingly negotiating. But Ms. DeLauro and other Democratic lawmakers argue that the president is asking for carte blanche to secretly negotiate a trade deal that would cost American jobs, weaken food safety and financial regulations and undermine environmental and labor standards.\u201cThe president has directed us to be responsive to the very important questions that are being asked by members of Congress,\u201d Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, said in an interview. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on now, I think, is part of the healthy give-and-take that should take place when we\u2019re contemplating an important piece of legislation.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers see a ripe opportunity to win approval of his trade agenda given that Congress is fully under the control of Republicans who back trade liberalization.Those measures \u201cwoke up Congress about what \u2018fast track\u2019 means,\u201d she said in an interview, and ever since \u201cit\u2019s really hard to get them to delegate that authority.\u201d She noted that in the 21 years since those deals were approved, Congress has awarded trade promotion authority to a president for a total of only five years.\u201cFor Obama, it\u2019s particularly tricky, because that big power grab would be used for this agreement that is basically a Trojan horse for every kind of extreme corporate proposal that could not get passed in the sunshine of public debate,\u201d she said.The White House rejects the characterization, arguing that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would raise standards across the board. Mr. Perez said officials were incorporating lawmakers\u2019 concerns about important elements of the agreement \u2014 like the need for stronger and quicker enforcement measures \u2014 into the continuing international negotiations.\u201cThe guidance from the president has been very clear: I want the best agreement that\u2019s going to protect American workers, provide decent hours and wages, and address both environment and labor conditions,\u201d Mr. Perez said.Republicans and centrist Democrats strongly support Mr. Obama\u2019s trade agenda. But given the bitter partisan divisions in Washington and Mr. Obama\u2019s aggressive use of executive action in recent months, it is unclear how unified Republicans will be in support of his trade initiatives.\u201cThis is the rare issue in which he\u2019s going to have more problems with the Democrats than with the Republicans because he is working against the wishes of key elements of the Democratic coalition,\u201d said David Karol, an associate professor at the University of Maryland who studies trade policy. \u201cBut some Republicans also just don\u2019t want to give President Obama a victory, period, no matter how much they may like the policy.\u201dAt the same time, business groups that are highly motivated to win approval of the new agreements are pressing Mr. Obama to take a more active role in selling his trade policies in Congress. \u201cHe\u2019s going to need to really step out a lot more and make the case for why this is important,\u201d said Christopher Wenk, senior director of international policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere are a lot of Democrats who want to be helpful on this, but they\u2019re waiting for the president to be out there leading \u2014 they need some cover.\u201dDemocratic critics are becoming increasingly vocal about their opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s stance. Some of them are popular with members of the party base who will play a major role in choosing the 2016 presidential nominee.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing, told a labor forum on Wednesday that trade agreements were among the poor choices that had \u201cleft America\u2019s middle class in a deep hole.\u201dThose concerns are fueling the opposition to the trade authority that Mr. Obama wants. It typically allows agreements to be considered by Congress on an expedited basis, with no opportunity for lawmakers to make changes.\u201cThe reality is that all of us here support the president and a lot of the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d Representative Donna F.

{"Headline": "Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant Begins Slow Process of Closing", "Date": "2015-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVERNON, Vt. \u2014 When the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant rose on a bank of the Connecticut River, in a region known more for farms and back-to-the-land communes, it was viewed by some as an economic adrenaline shot and by others as an incongruous curse on the land.The 605-megawatt reactor, which powered up here in the fall of 1972, brought high-paying jobs and expanded the tax base in a town with precious little industry. But it drew decades of protest from residents who feared a nuclear disaster in these bucolic environs and, over the past several years, a protracted effort by its home state to close it.So many in this region celebrated when, last week, the plant was taken off the grid and its nuclear reactor was shut down. It was not unexpected; the plant\u2019s parent company, Entergy, announced in 2013 that it would close the plant, saying it was no longer economically viable. But the shutdown left many here in spare Vernon steeling themselves for a loss.\u201cIt\u2019s more than an end of an era,\u201d said Patricia O\u2019Donnell, the chairwoman of the Vernon Selectboard, who is grateful for the money, jobs and people the plant brought here. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our best friend.\u201dIn a way, it was as if there were two Vermont Yankees: the one perceived as a nuclear threat and an affront to many in this deeply liberal state, as well as the parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire that border it; and the other, viewed here by many in Vernon as the kindly nuclear reactor next door.\u201cThe closer you get to the plant the more support you have for the plant, because we understand what the plant is,\u201d said Ms. O\u2019Donnell, who said 78 of the plant\u2019s employees lived in Vernon. \u201cWe know the people that work there.\u201dVernon is a verdant, if sparse, town of about 2,200, where farms are overlooked by wooded hills. Its eastern border is the Connecticut River, which is also the border between Vermont and New Hampshire. The best known and most photographed part of the structure is an enormous white and gray cube set off from its lush surroundings like a minimalist sculpture.To Stephen Skibniowsky, a third-generation Vernon resident, it has been a lifeline. He recalled his father, who was on the school board, happily anticipating more students when the plant\u2019s construction was announced. And, now 66, Mr. Skibniowsky has worked there for the duration of its operation.\u201cI fully expected that we would continue operating for another 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Skibniowsky, who is also the head of the town\u2019s planning commission. \u201cThe plant was well maintained. It was in good condition.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping that Vernon doesn\u2019t turn into a ghost town, but I guess we\u2019ll see,\u201d he added. Later this month, once the plant has all of the fuel out of the reactor, its staffing will drop by about half, to 316. By April 2016, after the fuel has had some time to cool, staffing will drop again to 127. When the spent fuel pool is shut down and security personnel are needed only to monitor dry cask storage, staffing will drop to about 50. Plant officials predict that will occur around 2020. The effect will be somewhat diffuse, since the plant\u2019s employees are scattered about communities in the three different states close to the plant, in towns like Brattleboro and Guilford in Vermont, and Chesterfield in New Hampshire. Entergy officials say they will try to relocate many of their employees to other plants the company owns.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be people filtering out, going elsewhere, because you just can\u2019t replace the kind of income and jobs at Walmart that this plant had,\u201d said Ken Farabaugh, a Vernon resident and plant employee who will take early retirement when the plant closes and focus on an online furniture business.Ms. O\u2019Donnell said she would like to bring a gas-fired power plant to Vernon. She said that the plant was assessed last year at $280 million and that the figure would fall. The town tightened its belt last year by cutting about $500,000 from the budget, including eliminating its police department and contracting with the county sheriff.The plant has stoked years of discontent from residents who live in the \u201cevacuation zone\u201d around the plant but not in Vernon proper. For some of them, it has been a source of looming unease.\u201cI get reminded every year when I get sent the battery for the emergency device,\u201d said Chris Hardee, a marketing consultant who lives in Chesterfield, just across the river from Vermont Yankee, \u201cand a wonderful calendar for the power company.\u201dMr. Hardee was working on his laptop at the food co-op in Brattleboro, the nearby town that has been fertile ground for antinuclear sentiment here. To him and a friend at the co-op, Lisa Merton, the shutdown was welcome news.\u201cIt could change life as we know it, and it still can,\u201d Ms. Merton, 62, a filmmaker who lives in Marlboro, said of the plant. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk that\u2019s worth taking.\u201dState legislators tried to close the plant, but a judge ruled in 2012 that they could not. Shortly after that decision was upheld, in August 2013, Entergy announced it would nevertheless close the plant, citing economics.He said it was not politics, although many who live here believe that the political environment made it harder to operate the plant.\u201cThis plant, this area, ranks right up there with the highest antinuke sentiment across the entire country,\u201d said Mr. Farabaugh, who worked in five other plants around the nation before coming to Vermont Yankee.Entergy projects it will cost $1.2 billion to decommission Vermont Yankee, but its trust fund has about half of that, so the full dismantling of the plant will not begin for decades. Meanwhile, the operators will turn to the mammoth task of cooling, storing and securing the spent fuel there. Federal law requires the government to develop a long-term storage facility for nuclear waste, but there is currently no plan in place. So the spent fuel at Vermont Yankee, like at closed nuclear facilities around the country, will stay on site, and officials say it will be safe.\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019re not splitting atoms now, that\u2019s very good, but we have 42 years of high-level waste that is far more dangerous if it were released to the environment than what would be in the reactor,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meant to Keep Malaria Out, Mosquito Nets Are Used to Haul Fish In", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGWEULU WETLANDS, Zambia \u2014 Out here on the endless swamps, a harsh truth has been passed down from generation to generation: There is no fear but the fear of hunger.With that always weighing on his mind, Mwewa Ndefi gets up at dawn, just as the first orange rays of sun are beginning to spear through the papyrus reeds, and starts to unclump a mosquito net.\u201cI know it\u2019s not right,\u201d Mr. Ndefi said, \u201cbut without these nets, we wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201dAcross Africa, from the mud flats of Nigeria to the coral reefs off Mozambique, mosquito-net fishing is a growing problem, an unintended consequence of one of the biggest and most celebrated public health campaigns in recent years.The nets have helped save millions of lives, but scientists worry about the collateral damage: Africa\u2019s fish.Part of the concern is the scale. Mosquito nets are now a billion-dollar industry, with hundreds of millions of insecticide-treated nets passed out in recent years, and many more on their way.They arrive by the truckload in poor, waterside communities where people have been trying to scrape by with substandard fishing gear for as long as anyone can remember. All of a sudden, there are light, soft, surprisingly strong nets \u2014 for free. Many people said it would be foolish not to use them for fishing.But the unsparing mesh, with holes smaller than mosquitoes, traps much more life than traditional fishing nets do. Scientists say that could imperil already stressed fish populations, a critical food source for millions of the world\u2019s poorest people.\u201cWe need a regulation to deal with these people,\u201d Mr. Museveni said. Most scientists say the risks to people are minimal, because the dosages are relatively low and humans metabolize permethrin quickly. But with coldblooded animals, it\u2019s a different story.The leading mosquito net manufacturers insist that their products are not dangerous. Still, many nets are labeled: \u201cDo not wash in a lake or a river.\u201dSome labels go even further, warning people to pour any water used in washing a net into a hole in the ground, \u201caway from home, animals and wells.\u201dWhen asked about this, Egon Weinmueller, a public health executive for BASF, a major netmaker, said, \u201cWe want to avoid any form of contamination.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cif it\u2019s a small pond, say maybe 10 meters, it could be a problem.\u201dFishermen used a mosquito net to catch juvenile catfish in the shallows of Lake Victoria in Kenya. Such nets, often distributed free to fight malaria in Africa, pose a potential environmental threat to fishing stocks.Though experts say that the vast majority of mosquito nets are used exactly the way they were intended \u2014 hung over beds \u2014 the full extent of mosquito-net fishing is unknown.Yet Mr. Faison and several other public health officials maintained that mosquito-net fishing was \u201canecdotal.\u201d \u201cIn regards to what we face,\u201d Mr. Faison said, \u201cit\u2019s an infinitesimal problem, maybe 1 percent.\u201dBut that would still amount to millions of nets.\u201cBut what if that net is distributed in a waterside, food-insecure area where maybe you won\u2019t be affecting the malaria rate at all and you might actually be hurting the environment?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose. And that\u2019s not a very neat story to tell.\u201dFabric of a CommunityAn insecticide-treated mosquito net, hung over a bed, is the front line in the battle against malaria. It\u2019s also the perfect mosquito-killing machine. The gauzy mesh allows the carbon dioxide that people exhale to flow out, which attracts mosquitoes. But as they swarm in, their cuticles touch the insecticide on the net\u2019s surface, poisoning their nervous systems and shutting down their microscopic hearts.But at the end of the line, in poor areas where little goes to waste, mosquito nets become many other things: soccer balls and chicken coops, bridal veils and funeral shrouds. Mosquito nets are literally part of the fabric of a community.For many uses, a secondhand net, which has less insecticide on it, will do. But for fishing, it\u2019s different.When asked where he had gotten his, he smiled.\u201cAt the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch cheaper than a real net.\u201d(A \u201creal\u201d net costs about $50, an enormous expense in a place where many people survive on a few dollars a day.)In Mr. Owich\u2019s world, there is no overstating the centrality of fish. His daily catch pays for school supplies and keeps the kerosene lamp lit in his mud hut. All around Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Malawi and so many others, fish are the engine block of the economy and a de facto social security system for landless people. \u201cYou can see it in people\u2019s moods,\u201d said Said Katensi, a Tanzanian conservationist on Lake Tanganyika. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s fish, everyone is happy. When there isn\u2019t any fish, like now, everyone is sad.\u201dDwindling Fish PopulationsOut on the Bangweulu flood plains of Zambia, where the swamps stretch all the way to the horizon in every direction, a reed basket used to be the primary fishing technology.But the other day, when one of Mr. Ndefi\u2019s neighbors went to check some fish traps in a few feet of dank swamp water, it was obvious why mosquito mesh had replaced it. A trap made from traditional reeds was empty. The trap next to it, made from a mosquito net, was jumping with tiny silvery fish.Recent hydroacoustic surveys show that Zambia\u2019s fish populations are dwindling. Harris Phiri, a Zambian fisheries official, blamed deforestation, rapid population growth and the widespread use of mosquito nets.\u201cThey are catching very small fish that haven\u2019t matured,\u201d Mr. Phiri said. \u201cThe stocks won\u2019t be able to grow.\u201dJeppe Kolding, a Danish fisheries ecologist, has challenged the conventional wisdom. He advocates a \u201cbalanced harvest\u201d approach that calls for catching more juvenile fish and sparing some of the adults, arguing that mosquito-net fishing may not harm fish stocks as much as widely believed.\u201cFish are more like plants than other animals,\u201d he said, \u201cin that they disperse millions of seeds.\u201dBut even he acknowledges that, for fishing purposes, it would be much better if the nets used were not treated with toxic chemicals.In many places, fish are dried for hours in direct sunlight on treated mosquito nets. Direct sunlight can break down the insecticide coating. Anthony Hay, an associate professor of environmental toxicology at Cornell University, said fish could absorb some of the toxins, leaving people to ingest them when they eat the fish.Fishermen\u2019s FeudWhen the nets land on the beach, it\u2019s like peering into the stomach of the sea: a squishy mass of sand, seaweed, dead blowfish, dead baby eels and thousands of baby shrimp, their bodies translucent, their tiny eyes black dots no larger than specks of sand.The Malagasy word for these nets is \u201cramikaoko,\u201d or the thing that takes all things together. The extent of the damage is unclear, but recent surveys show that Madagascar\u2019s industrial shrimp catch plummeted to 3,143 tons in 2010 from 8,652 tons in 2002.The group calls itself Fearless, and it prowls the pebbly, windswept beaches, looking for mosquito nets to seize.Be Zocilin, a stocky member with a thick neck and browning teeth, sheepishly held up his left arm to show a half-moon scar \u2014 a bite mark.\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the other side brought war.\u201dMr. Zocilin explained, and several witnesses confirmed, that he had been attacked and nearly killed by mosquito-net fishermen.In another village, mosquito-net users crept up to the boats of professional fishermen late one night and cut them loose into the sea. The net users were so furious about anyone trying to take away their nets that they started a boycott of the professional fishermen.\u201cEven my own sisters didn\u2019t sell me rice,\u201d said Adrien Labiza, a professional fisherman who has tried, with little success, to persuade friends and family not to fish with mosquito nets.Clearly, there are no easy answers. In all these places, the people fishing with mosquito nets tend to be those without boats or even tackle, often women and children, the most dispossessed. They work from shore, tugging the nets through shallow waters, precisely where many species spawn, creating another potential problem: the slow, steady destruction of sensitive aquatic breeding grounds.Dr. Lehman, the American physician on Lake Tanganyika, wonders if there might be better malaria solutions for waterside communities. Specially treated wall coverings? Custom-fit window screens? \u201cWhy is this question not being asked?\u201d she said, a bit exasperated. \u201cIs it that we don\u2019t really want to know the answer?\u201dFor Mr. Ndefi, it is a simple, if painful, matter of choice. He knows all too well the dangers of malaria. His own toddler son, Junior, died of the disease four years ago. Junior used to always be there, standing outside his hut, when Mr. Ndefi came home from fishing.Mr. Ndefi hopes his family can survive future bouts of the disease. But he knows his loved ones will not last long without food.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Thai Leader Impeached, Reawakening Tensions", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Dormant political tensions re-emerged in Thailand on Friday when the military junta\u2019s handpicked assembly impeached the country\u2019s former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra.Shortly before the vote, which imposed a five-year political ban on Ms. Yingluck, the government also announced that she would be charged with criminal negligence over a subsidy program for rice farmers.Ms. Yingluck, the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, the tycoon and founder of a political movement that has antagonized Thailand\u2019s elites and plunged the country into nearly a decade of political turmoil, faces up to 10 years in prison.After overthrowing Ms. Yingluck\u2019s government in May, the military formed its own government, saying that it did not want to exacerbate tensions in Thailand\u2019s deeply fissured society and would work to achieve reconciliation.But the vote on Friday and the decision to indict by prosecutors, who had maintained for months that there was not enough evidence for a case, may prolong what has already been a lost decade of street protests, two military coups and bloodshed.Critics of the prosecution of Ms. Yingluck note that Thailand\u2019s economy is one of the poorest performers in Asia, growing barely 1 percent last year. The prosecution of Ms. Yingluck dredges up divisive conflicts that the military had said it would bury.The National Legislative Assembly, handpicked by the junta after the coup, voted 190 to 18 to impeach Ms. Yingluck on the grounds that the rice subsidies were a form of corruption.The junta has not explained how people who no longer hold political office can be impeached.Economists considered the rice program wasteful, and it angered members of the Bangkok establishment, who resented that their taxes were being used to pay farmers well above market prices for their rice. It was one of the key complaints of members of the Bangkok elite who led debilitating protests in Bangkok last year. They blocked voting in elections and pressured financial institutions to withhold payments to farmers.Ms. Yingluck has defended the rice subsidy program as assistance for the poor.\u201cMany governments have public policies to help farmers,\u201d she said in testimony at the impeachment hearings. \u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s duty to look after them.\u201dThe point of the program, she said, was \u201creducing the gap between the rich and the poor, reducing social disparity.\u201dThe rice subsidies, which caused the government to borrow heavily, benefited the rural constituencies that form the core support of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party, a populist political movement that upended Thai politics with sweeping electoral victories and the deep loyalty of rural voters newly awakened to their electoral clout. Her party has won every election since 2001.Both the impeachment and the criminal charges against Ms. Yingluck have been spearheaded by Vicha Mahakhun, a commissioner of the National Anti-Corruption Commission and a longtime political foe of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s political movement.Mr. Vicha replied during the impeachment hearings to critics who said there was no concrete evidence of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s involvement in corruption.\u201cYour behavior signifies a strong suspicion of corruption,\u201d he said.The prime minister, Mr. Vicha said, refused to heed his warnings about the cost of the rice subsidy. \u201cThis has led to enormous damage to the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has given rise to continual violence in the country.\u201dMr. Vicha is notorious among supporters of Ms. Yingluck for helping rewrite the Thai Constitution after the 2006 coup, saying at the time that elections were \u201cevil.\u201dThe impeachment proceedings against Ms. Yingluck and her two allies have morphed into what the military had vowed to avoid: a proxy battle between the elected politicians overthrown in the coup and the military that overthrew them.Nikom Wairatpanij, a former speaker of the Thai Senate, was charged in the impeachment hearings with violating a constitution that no longer exists. He was charged with procedural lapses while passing an amendment that would have made the Senate fully elected. He survived the impeachment vote, 95 for and 120 against.\u201cI would like to urge you,\u201d Mr. Nikom said during the hearings earlier this month, \u201cif you are democratic people, do not hate the people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Search for Petr Khokhlov", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter their father died and their mother fell into drink, Petr Khokhlov and his brother, Sergey, were sent to an orphanage in Novouzensk, a small, dusty town of low-slung Soviet-era apartment blocks on Russia\u2019s border with Kazakhstan. The two boys had only each other. Petr was quiet and well behaved, scolding other students at the orphanage when they addressed their teachers with the familiar ty, rather than the more formal vy. He played the balalaika in music class and carried himself as a little gentleman, with any number of pretty girls in tow. As they grew up, Petr would consult with his older brother on just about every decision, down to what T-shirts he should buy. When Sergey was courting the woman who would later become his wife, Petr \u2014 just two years Sergey\u2019s junior, but with a soft, boyish face that made him look even younger \u2014 would tag along on their dates to the movies and fall asleep in the back seat on the drive home.When Petr turned 18 and left the orphanage school, he was sent away for his year of mandatory army service and ended up at a base hundreds of miles north, in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. Nine months in, he decided to sign up for a three-year contract as a professional soldier. Russia\u2019s armed forces are made up of its large conscript army, with 340,000 young men drafted each year, as well as a professional force of 220,000 officers and 200,000 contract soldiers. Petr didn\u2019t see many other ways to get the money to pay for college or one day buy an apartment. Sergey opposed the plan. He wanted his brother back in Novouzensk with him, as always. But Petr was determined: \u201cI should stay here and drink myself to death? Or work on a construction site?\u201d he asked.Petr came home for a visit, and the two brothers argued. \u201cDon\u2019t sign,\u201d Sergey begged him. \u201cServe out your time and come back here.\u201dBut Sergey knew there was another reason his brother wanted to stay at the base: Petr had fallen in love with a cheerful student at a local medical college. Anna Komolova was 17, with a gentle smile that curved up at its edges and blond hair that fell over her forehead. She also grew up without parents, a fact that brought her and Petr closer together; it didn\u2019t take long before the two of them were talking of moving in together. After half a year of dating, Petr proposed. They planned to register their marriage in October, after Anna turned 18 and Petr had a chance to take her home to Novouzensk to introduce her to Sergey and his wife, Nazira. Sergey knew that staying close to Nizhny Novgorod was a way for Petr to stay close to Anna, who had several years of medical studies left. It was hard having his younger brother so far away, but he came to understand \u2014 respect, even \u2014 Petr\u2019s decision. \u201cO.K., so he wants to achieve something, he\u2019s put a goal in front of himself,\u201d he thought.On Aug. 19, Sergey got a call from a friend in town, who told him that the local draft board in Novouzensk was claiming that Petr had abandoned his post. He was missing. Two officers were on their way to Novouzensk to look for him. Sergey assured them that Petr had not returned home, but he had no idea where his brother could be. \u201cWhy would he run off?\u201d Sergey wondered. He was a contract soldier now, not a conscript, and he could quit if he wanted to.An hour later, Sergey and Nazira arrived at the draft office to find the officers already there. They handed him a stack of fliers that they were posting around town, bearing Petr\u2019s face and birth date, his military ID number, his home address. As the officers talked with Sergey, one received a call from a commander back in Nizhny Novgorod. There is a video on YouTube, the caller said. Petr was in Ukraine.Nazira rushed to find the video on her phone. Everyone \u2014 the two officers included \u2014 hunched over the small screen to watch. There was Petr, in rumpled dark green fatigues, his smooth face a canvas of exhaustion and fear. \u201cYou could see that he was nervous,\u201d Sergey told me. \u201cHe was sighing. Even his mouth had gone dry. He wasn\u2019t himself.\u201dThis happened several times, Petr explained, listing the last names of the officers who gave the orders: Sashenko, Polomotov, Dultsev. Sergey noticed that at certain moments in Petr\u2019s account \u2014 when he talked of passing military hardware to the rebels or of seeing separatist fighters fire grenades and mortars at civilians \u2014 the officers standing next to him in the draft office muttered, even winced. \u201cHe knows a lot of information,\u201d one said ominously.At this point in the interrogation, Petr\u2019s tale shifted suddenly from a narrative of dutiful soldiership to one of wild adventurism. With another soldier from the Ninth Brigade, he said, he ran away from their temporary base in the middle of the night and walked across the border. They wanted to join the rebel militia, which he heard was paying 150,000 rubles a month, or roughly $4,000 at the time. After walking for two days through the forest, they swam across a river and were eventually captured by a group of rebel fighters. At their base in the town of Novosvitlivka, the rebels took him into their ranks. Petr said they gave him an ammunition vest, a Kalashnikov rifle and some grenades. He drove off in a Soviet-made Lada with three militants; his friend took off in another direction in a BMW. Before long, the car Petr was riding in was stopped by Ukrainian soldiers, who took everyone into custody. After questioning, he said, \u201cthey gave me something to eat and cigarettes.\u201d The video ended abruptly, the beam of a flashlight casting a weak, spectral light on Petr\u2019s face.The officers immediately called their superiors, who ordered them to stay the night in Novouzensk and return to base the next day. Before they left, they gave Sergey some instructions: Don\u2019t go anywhere. Don\u2019t ask for help from anyone. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him back ourselves,\u201d one officer told him, promising a prisoner exchange with the Ukrainians. Nazira began to cry.Anna recalls that Petr\u2019s first few weeks of service were uneventful, even idle. \u201cWe slack off,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe don\u2019t do all that much.\u201d But then, near the end of June, Petr and the rest of the soldiers in the brigade were dispatched to the Rostov region for military exercises. As Anna remembers it, Petr\u2019s commanders first told him it would be for a week, maybe two. After a month went by, Petr told Anna that he would be back by September. The last time they spoke was the end of July. \u201cYou rarely call,\u201d Anna told him. \u201cI\u2019ve already grown unaccustomed to your voice.\u201d \u201cMore often isn\u2019t possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll come back soon.\u201d In that call, he said something about the Donbass, the contested region in eastern Ukraine. Petr and his fellow soldiers were stationed either there or near there on the Russian side of the border \u2014 she couldn\u2019t remember exactly.This last call came at a moment when the war was shifting to a new phase \u2014 and as a result, Russia, too, was changing its approach to the conflict. In the early days of the war in April and May, rebel forces routed the Ukrainian Army and the volunteer battalions fighting alongside it in humiliating battles, seizing ever greater swaths of territory. For much of the spring and summer, Russia\u2019s involvement, at least in a strictly military sense, was limited to supplying weapons and equipment to the rebels; to the extent that Russian soldiers were on the ground in the east, they tended to be instructors or technical specialists. But as the war \u2014 or what the new Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, who was elected in May, referred to as an \u201cantiterrorist operation\u201d \u2014 dragged on, the Ukrainian side began to reverse the momentum. By the beginning of August, the government in Kiev had recaptured 75 percent of the territory once controlled by the rebels. Its often indiscriminate artillery campaign had shattered Luhansk, a city whose prewar population was nearly 450,000, leaving it without electricity and on the verge of capture by pro-Kiev militias. Donetsk, the largest city in the rebel-held east and the separatists\u2019 political capital, seemed poised to fall within weeks, if not days.If the rebels were defeated, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would lose his leverage in Ukraine. He needed the separatists to hang on, almost certainly not because he wanted to annex the land they controlled but because it was advantageous for the conflict to remain unresolved, an instrument that Russia could use to complicate Ukrainian politics for years to come. Putin warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if Kiev pressed its campaign. He kept saying there could be no military solution, a declaration made not for any humanistic reason but because he didn\u2019t want his proxy force to suffer a battlefield defeat before he could extract a political victory.In August, days after Petr\u2019s disappearance, separatist forces began a counteroffensive against the Ukrainian Army. But mounting evidence suggests that the decisive role in this attack was played by Russian military units, which for the first time in the war were directly participating in battles inside Ukraine. For Russian officials and the country\u2019s state-run media, the direct involvement of Russian soldiers in the war \u2014 and especially the fact that dozens, maybe hundreds, were killed in the fighting \u2014 was a taboo subject, ignored or denied by all levels of the state bureaucracy. But the difference on the battlefield was palpable. Ukrainian forces could hope, with just a bit more time, to defeat a rebel insurgency, but they had no chance against the Russian Army and its weaponry. The West was not going to come to Poroshenko\u2019s rescue, making clear that any further efforts by Kiev to keep the fight going would risk total defeat. Days after the counteroffensive began, Poroshenko went to Minsk, Belarus, where he agreed to a cease-fire that ceded wide authority to the rebels, in effect creating a frozen conflict zone in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia.Officers at the base had also been in touch with Anna. Not long after Petr disappeared, she received a call: \u201cAre you the girlfriend of Petr Sergeevich Khokhlov? Do you know where he is currently located?\u201d She thought it was a joke; in any case, she told me, she had no idea of Petr\u2019s whereabouts and hadn\u2019t heard from him since his disappearance. She was worried and angry. \u201cThey beat into my head that he ran away, like he was the worst kind of scum.\u201d Then the calls from the base turned menacing. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is, but if he shows up, things are only going to be worse for him,\u201d his commander told her. He said they might charge Petr with desertion, which carried a possible prison sentence of seven years. A woman who said she was the resident psychologist at the base sent Anna the video of Petr\u2019s interrogation and told her that he had willingly deserted to the side of the rebels. The next day, the commander called. That was my wife, he told Anna. \u201cDelete the video, delete all the messages. Don\u2019t tell anyone anything, don\u2019t show anything to anyone.\u201dBy the fall, a sense of futility had crept in. When the various arms of the Russian state machine retract and fold in on themselves, stretching them back out becomes nearly impossible. Sergey wrote a letter to Russia\u2019s defense minister, Sergey Shoygu, and Anna wrote her own letter to Putin through the presidential website. Neither heard back. When I visited Sergey and Nazira at their spare one-room apartment on the outskirts of Novouzensk, their communication with the commanders in Petr\u2019s unit had also fallen apart. I sat in the kitchen with them, snacking on thick, oily slices of pink sausage wedged between crusty slices of bread, as Nazira called a lieutenant colonel in charge of brigade security. A stiff male voice answered. Nazira said she was calling about Petr.\u201cDo you have any news about him?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t have any information,\u201d the man replied and then promptly hung up.\u201cWhat hurts the most,\u201d Sergey said, \u201cis that if something happened to me, Petya wouldn\u2019t sit at home. He would figure something out. But here we are. We don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d All he and Nazira could think of was selling their apartment and using the money to go to Moscow and hire a lawyer. So far, everyone they approached had \u201claughed at us like fools,\u201d Sergey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the law. We don\u2019t know anything. So we\u2019ll show up someplace, and they\u2019ll tell us, \u2018So what do you want?'\u2009\u201d It had become obvious that a Russian soldier in Ukraine was a deeply inconvenient person to bring home.For all the official silence on the subject, the role played by Russian forces\u00ad in the conflict has become increasingly impossible to deny. Among other pieces of evidence, journalists found Russian military documents and equipment on the battlefield, and a number of secret or suspicious burials of Russian soldiers back home belied the claim that no Russian servicemen were in eastern Ukraine. Independent websites have cropped up to collect stories from families and friends about Russian soldiers being captured or killed in Ukraine, and one of them puts the possible tally in the hundreds.The story of one unit, the 331st Airborne Regiment, based near the city of Kostroma, is particularly telling. On Aug. 25, the Ukrainian security services announced that they had captured 10 paratroopers from the regiment about 20 miles inside Ukrainian territory. In a series of videos made during their detention, a number of the prisoners from the 331st spoke of being ordered to drive their armored vehicles in the direction of certain coordinates; they realized they were in Ukraine only when they saw a tank with a Ukrainian flag on it, at which point they came under fire. Asked about their capture, Putin explained that the paratroopers had \u201cjust gotten lost\u201d on an unmarked stretch of the border.But on Sept. 2, a soldier from the regiment, Sergey Seleznev, was buried in his hometown, Vladimir, a medieval town of 12th-century cathedrals just a short drive from Moscow. Local military officials said he died during exercises in Rostov. Around the same time, another paratrooper, Andrei Pilipchuk, was buried in Kostroma, as officials remained silent about the circumstances of his death; administrators at the cemetery in Kostroma told reporters from the Russian newspaper RBC of three more soldiers from the 331st who were recently buried there \u2014 killed \u201cin Ukraine,\u201d they said. Then, on Sept. 4, the state-controlled Channel One broadcast a report showing the funeral of a 28-year-old paratrooper from the regiment, Anatoly Travkin. Over a shot of a wooden coffin draped in a Russian flag, an anchor explained how he died: \u201cA month ago, he left for the Donbass without telling those close to him. The commanders of the unit emphasize that he took a vacation to leave for the war zone.\u201d Taken at face value, these mysterious episodes suggest that the 331st had a summer full of surprising and dangerous misadventures: In the span of one month, some of them became lost and wandered into Ukraine, others were killed while on training exercises near the border and at least one died fighting as a volunteer.When Putin lit a memorial candle at Moscow\u2019s Holy Trinity Church on Sept. 10 in the name of \u201cthose who suffered in defending people in Novorossiya,\u201d the czarist-era term for southeastern Ukraine that had been resurrected by pro-Russian separatists, it was seen as a tacit gesture to those Russian servicemen who were killed or injured in Ukraine. (Putin\u2019s spokesman rejected this interpretation.) But the official position of Putin and other Kremlin officials has remained the same from the beginning: No Russian soldiers were ever ordered into Ukraine. At a news conference on Dec. 18, Putin again denied that Russia sent its forces into Ukraine over the summer. \u201cWe\u2019re not attacking anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not warmongers.\u201dAs with the ill-fated 331st Airborne, there was compelling evidence \u2014 albeit more circumstantial \u2014 that Petr\u2019s brigade was indeed involved in the war. When Sergey visited Nizhny Novgorod, commanders told him that Petr was just one of six soldiers in the Ninth Brigade who disappeared during their summertime exercises in Rostov. In July, the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published an article about two other soldiers from the brigade, Armen Davoyan and Alexander Voronov, who were killed \u201con the border with Ukraine\u201d in the Rostov region. According to the report, they came under fire while escorting a column of refugees. The article soon vanished from the paper\u2019s website.I spoke by phone with the 74-year-old grandmother of Voronov, who was 23 when he died, a soldier in the special forces. He had lost both his parents at a young age, and his grandmother raised him for most of his life. In June, he told her he was headed to Rostov for exercises. On the morning of July 14, a small group of military officers showed up at her house in a rural village outside of Nizhny Novgorod and told her, as she remembers, \u201cYour grandson no longer is.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know the details of his death; all she was told was that it was \u201cdue to military circumstances.\u201dPerhaps no one knows more about how post-Soviet Russia prosecutes its wars than Valentina Melnikova, the head of the Union of the Committees of Soldiers\u2019 Mothers of Russia. Her organization came to prominence during the first war in Chechnya, in the mid-1990s, which began with a disastrous series of clandestine exercises in which scores of Russian soldiers were killed. Yet President Boris N. Yeltsin spent months denying that there were any Russian troops in Chechnya. In Moscow this fall, I went to visit Melnikova, a forceful 68-year-old with arched eyebrows and a short, tousled mop of red hair. The amount of paperwork stacked on every surface and spare corner of her office testified to the deadening complexity of the Russian bureaucratic machine. Every request for information she files requires letters and documents with official stamps; the answers, when they come, pile up in precarious towers around the committee\u2019s one-room headquarters.What had her the most confused and depressed was how mothers of servicemen deployed during the war in Chechnya would wait in lines as long as 200 people to get into her office. They wanted to know where their sons were and how to get them back. Now she gets a handful of inquiries from family members about Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t want to believe, or can\u2019t believe, that it\u2019s real life, that it\u2019s really happening,\u201d she said. Society had become passive again, too fearful or timid to take on the state: If the powers that be said there was no war, then there wasn\u2019t.Sergey was one of the few who had asked Melnikova for help, and she agreed to make some calls and put in official requests for information to see what she could learn about Petr\u2019s fate. But despite her connections with military sources, Melnikova, who had been looking into the case for more than a month, still didn\u2019t have any concrete answers. An official at the Defense Ministry told her that Petr was the subject of a criminal case for desertion; although, oddly, he added that it was the Russian state\u2019s position that Petr went to fight not with the rebels but with the Ukrainian Army. Her appeals for information were circulating from one office to another. The state had decided to \u201cplay the fool,\u201d she said, shuffling her requests from desk to desk in an endless loop. \u201cIt\u2019s a dead end.\u201dShe thought it was possible that Petr had been recaptured by Russian officers and was being held somewhere on Russian territory to keep him from talking. There was precedent for such a situation: In 1999, during the second war in Chechnya, Melnikova was called to an airport in Moscow to meet a group of Russian soldiers who had been captured by militants and then freed. But the soldiers never showed up; they were taken away by a special counterterrorism unit at the arrival gate, and it took Melnikova two weeks of calls to track them down. \u201cWe found them alive, but that was a different time,\u201d she said. As for Petr, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what kind of condition we\u2019ll find him in, or if we\u2019ll find him at all.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s like it was in Chernobyl,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has been covered by a giant sarcophagus.\u201dAfter a few days in Kiev, my own search for Petr finally yielded a lead. An S.B.U. official and representatives of the rebel forces all agreed that on Sept. 21, just before dusk on a stretch of highway outside Donetsk, Petr \u2014 along with 22 others suspected of being rebel fighters \u2014 was handed over from Ukrainian custody to the control of the separatist leadership. It was one of a handful of prisoner exchanges that took place this fall, as called for by the cease-fire accords signed in Minsk. I watched a video of the release, filmed by a member of the \u201cpolitburo\u201d of the rebel defense ministry. It all happens quickly: A bus pulls up and then Petr and the others get off and are lined up by the side of the road. A few minutes later, with the sun dipping below the horizon, they step onto another bus and head into rebel territory.At a minimum, this meant that Petr left Ukrainian custody alive. The rebel official who confirmed Petr\u2019s release and handover suggested that he might have joined one of the separatist militias fighting in the east. When I told that to Melnikova, she replied, \u201cIf he\u2019s alive, then he will show up sooner or later.\u201d But that, she went on to clarify, was the optimistic scenario. \u201cIf he really is fighting with the rebels and ends up in battle and is killed somewhere, then how will we ever find him?\u201dOne cold, windy night, with the streets dark and still, I met up with Vanya Kuznetsov, a 28-year-old who worked as a security guard at a supermarket in the city before he joined the rebel militia in late April. His father fought in the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. \u201cHe fought for someone else\u2019s land, and I decided to defend my own turf,\u201d he told me. We were sitting in one of Donetsk\u2019s few functioning cafes apart from the strange hotel-lobby scene; after 8 p.m., it was hard to find a cup of tea, let alone dinner. A woman in the rebel leadership had given me Vanya\u2019s number: He had been captured by Ukrainian forces, held in the city of Kharkiv alongside Petr and released in the same prisoner exchange. Since then, he has worked as a driver for a high-ranking rebel military commander in town.Vanya had the build of a wrestler, with thick shoulders set above wide, muscular arms, and a round face that brightened when he smiled. He told me that for 28 days, he and Petr shared a cell at the S.B.U. building in Kharkiv \u2014 13 detainees in all, in a cell built for five. Vanya said he was arrested by Ukrainian forces in July. Petr joined him a month later. \u201cWhen they brought Petya in, his clothes were ripped, his pants hanging loose,\u201d Vanya told me. \u201cIt looked like he was wearing a skirt, like a Scottish guy.\u201d The two became close. Vanya told stories of vacations with his two children; Petr spoke of Sergey and his boyhood years at the orphanage.According to Vanya, Petr insisted that he had come to Ukraine of his own volition. His unit, he said, went to the Russian side of the border for exercises. From there, his story tracked roughly with the second part of the tale he told on camera: One night, Petr got drunk with a friend and fellow soldier \u2014 Garafeev, presumably \u2014 and swam across the Donets River, eventually joining the ranks of rebel fighters in Luhansk before he and some others were captured.This part of Petr\u2019s story mystified me, perhaps because it mystified everyone who knew him. When I asked Anna about it, she replied, \u201cHe simply couldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Sergey was positive that Petr would have asked for his advice. \u201cHis goal was to marry his girlfriend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to throw all that away to run off to Ukraine, so as to never come back?\u201d An official at the S.B.U. told me that he doubted that Petr crossed the border on his own and that his superiors most likely fed him this explanation. \u201cI think he was asked to tell this story to us: If you are captured, then say this and this,\u201d the S.B.U. official said. It certainly was the talking point of Russian officials faced with questions about Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine; Putin himself said last month that such soldiers were simply answering \u201ca call of the heart.\u201dBut Vanya, perhaps predictably, believed that the first part of Petr\u2019s confession \u2014 about the operation to deliver vehicles to the rebels \u2014 was the part he fabricated under duress. Once Petr ended up in Kharkiv, he said, \u201cthey put psychological pressure on him. They wanted to use him to prove that Russian soldiers were fighting in Donbass.\u201d Meeting Petr came as a revelation, he told me. \u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said. \u201cOur generation is full of bums on the couch. I respect him for what he did, that he carried out such a feat, the feat of a hero.\u201d Vanya hadn\u2019t heard from him since they were freed. \u201cIf I ever see him again,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m ready to get on my knees.\u201dI went to pay them a visit one morning in Donetsk. The dorm hallways were busy with fighters moving supplies in and out; like much of the rebel-held east, the whole place had an improvised, jury-rigged air to it. Galina and Valentina\u2019s room was on the eighth floor, a small space containing not much more than two narrow beds and an electric teakettle. They greeted me warmly, telling me how good it was that I had come, that I must sit and talk and eat more of the biscuits they kept putting in front of me. Galya and Valya \u2014 as everyone called them \u2014 wore their reddish-brown hair cut to their shoulders and, despite the crudeness of their current accommodations, made a fuss of putting on lipstick and blush in the mirror after I arrived. As we sipped instant coffee made sweet with condensed milk and several spoonfuls of sugar, our chat was occasionally interrupted by the rumbling of artillery fire. Rebel forces and the Ukrainian military were still fighting over the Donetsk airport, now a monstrous jumble of burned-out concrete and steel just five miles from the center of town.Galya and Valya were from Yenakievo, a battered industrial city of 85,000 people and the hometown of former President Yanukovych, which fell under rebel control in the spring. Valya had worked at a mine, Galya at a metallurgical plant. Both had long been aggrieved by the many injustices they and their town had suffered since the Soviet collapse: the rapid loss of jobs, of the placid dependability of life under communism, of local wealth they believed had been sucked up by politicians and oligarchs in Kiev. For them, the fall of Yanukovych was nothing less than a putsch carried out by nationalists from western Ukraine, who disdained everything Russian and looked at people in the Russian-speaking east with suspicion, if not condescension. As with so much about the war and its causes, this narrative was both partly true and woefully incomplete. Nonetheless, like many in eastern Ukraine, Galya and Valya saw the success of the revolution and the ascendancy of its leaders as a direct, even existential threat.They started by going to anti-Kiev demonstrations last spring \u2014 after the revolution but before the conflict in the east took shape \u2014 and each had sons and daughters who joined the militia. \u201cThey are fighting for a different life, so there are no oligarchs, so we have stability,\u201d Galya told me. \u201cStability\u201d was a word I heard repeatedly in eastern Ukraine, a term that combines nostalgia, frustration and the idea \u2014 however illogical \u2014 that the country\u2019s leaders in Kiev, and especially those who took power after the revolution, are responsible for all the disappointment and unrealized promise of the post-Soviet transition. Now, Valya said, unlike in Soviet days, \u201cif you want to go to the Urals, you have to work for half a year, sit at home and not drink anything, and then you\u2019ll have saved enough for the trip.\u201dThey said they remembered Petr, of course. He was quiet and sweet and didn\u2019t make much of a fuss over himself. He came late at night after his release, Valya said. The next morning, Petr told her simply that he was leaving for Luhansk, before heading off with five other fellow former prisoners. In Luhansk, she said, Petr broke off from the group, along with Asya Arutunyan, a 28-year-old woman from Kharkiv who was imprisoned for aiding the rebels.I reached Arutunyan by phone a few days later. She told me that over the course of the summer, as the war\u2019s ferocity increased, she began driving her car several hours into the Luhansk region \u2014 where the fighting was most intense \u2014 to deliver food and supplies to the older residents stuck there and help bring out those who wanted to leave. She told me she made the trip every day for two months, driving hundreds of people from the conflict zone into the relative safety of Kharkiv. One day in September, she was detained by Ukrainian soldiers in Izyum, a kind of garrison city for pro-Kiev forces. They put a bag over her head and took her to the Kharkiv S.B.U. building, where she was interrogated.\u201cYou\u2019re a separatist, a terrorist, you must have ties to the rebels,\u201d she recalled Ukrainian officers yelling at her. When she asked to call relatives to tell them where she was and that she was alive, she said, the answer was no: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen too many American films, you have no rights, you\u2019re in a ghost world.\u201d She was the only woman held at the S.B.U. building, and after a while the guards asked to her to help distribute food to the other prisoners. That was how she met Petr. \u201cHe has a very kind heart,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe\u2019s young, but is a real hero, with a very brave core.\u201dAfter Luhansk, Arutunyan told me, they headed to Stakhanov, a mining town 40 miles away under the control of a separatist Cossack brigade. She didn\u2019t stay long, wanting to get back to her family. The last she heard \u2014 although this piece of news was some weeks old already \u2014 was that Petr stayed to join the rebel militia there.In the center of town we found a woman named Katya, an energetic young correspondent for Cossack Radio, a pro-rebel news and propaganda service that broadcasts in the towns under separatist control. The radio network was started several months back, at the very beginning of the war, and airs everything from traditional Cossack songs to talk shows that debate various points of Russian Orthodox practice. I barely had a chance to greet her before she hopped back in her car and sped off, signaling for us to follow.Katya had called ahead to help us get past the guards at the checkpoint, and now she offered to show us around. The center of Stakhanov looked like many other depressed industrial towns across the former Soviet Union: weather-\u00adstained apartment blocks, an empty and windswept central square far bigger than what this half-\u00adpopulated town merited. We drove behind her past another checkpoint and came to a stop in front of the town\u2019s municipal police headquarters, which had been taken over and converted into the local Cossack military garrison.Inside, Katya led us down a hallway, exchanging cheerful greetings with the rebel fighters as we walked. She motioned me through an open door. Here, she said, is your hero.I immediately recognized Petr. Sitting on a narrow bed pushed up against the wall, he had the faint outcroppings of a honey-colored beard, and his face had been burned pink by the cold wind. But as his head turned, there was no mistaking him. He let out a weak smile. I sat down and introduced myself; the idea that an American reporter had come all the way to Stakhanov to find him, of all people, struck him as strange, but also intriguing enough to talk with me. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said. \u201cHello,\u201d he answered. As it turns out, Katya had found him in his barracks and walked him over to meet me \u2014 as simple, in the end, as that.I asked how he ended up here, in a forgotten mining town run by Cossacks \u2014 or in Ukraine at all, for that matter. He started by saying something obviously not true: that he finished his mandatory army service in May and was in Nizhny Novgorod \u2014 not a soldier, but a civilian \u2014 when he began to follow events in eastern Ukraine. He spoke in many of the same generalities I heard throughout eastern Ukraine among the rebels and their sympathizers: The new government in Kiev was behaving like the Nazis, the ugly face of fascism had returned and so on. \u201cI read an article about how somewhere in Luhansk region, the Ukrainian National Guard found a World War II veteran, put a uniform on him and slit his throat,\u201d he said. He told me he made his own way to the border. Everything he said on camera about exercises in Rostov and passing equipment to the rebels was a fiction, he said, forced upon him by his Ukrainian guards. \u201cThey sat me in the chair,\u201d he said, \u201cand told me to read what they had written.\u201dAfter the clear falsehood \u2014 his brother, his fianc\u00e9e and even his own military commanders all agreed that Petr was an active-duty soldier sent to Rostov this summer \u2014 he continued with a story that more or less coincided with what he said on the video and to Vanya. He and Garafeev walked through the forest, found some rebels and managed to join up with them. Not long after, Petr was captured; he, too, had heard that Garafeev might be dead. The first days of his detention, he was shuttled around various cities under Kiev\u2019s control: Izyum, Kramatorsk, then Kharkiv, where he spent nearly a month. After he was released, he knew he wanted to rejoin the rebels. \u201cHow could I not stay?\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come all this way to leave right away.\u201dAs Petr talked, he seemed nervous but not panicked, and it was hard to say whether his short, clipped answers were a normal teenage tic or an attempt to mislead me. He pulled from his coat pocket a laminated card bearing his picture and the insignia of the \u201cLuhansk People\u2019s Republic.\u201d His job in the militia in Stakhanov is to stand watch, to keep an eye on things at the front, where the fighting is most active. He hasn\u2019t seen battle yet, he said, but he\u2019d like to. Petr was vague about his plans, saying in one moment that he wanted to stay until the rebels defeated the \u201cfascism\u201d of the Ukrainian state once and for all, but in another that he missed Sergey and Anna and would like to rejoin them. He had found a way to contact both of them, and Sergey had urged him to come home. But Petr told me he would keep fighting here until it was over, \u201cso it will be like it used to be, when it was quiet.\u201d He went on: \u201cSo that people lived with conscience, so that innocent people won\u2019t be killed, children. So that veterans don\u2019t have their throats cut.\u201dWe weren\u2019t alone as he spoke. His Cossack commander was sitting in the room, a man in his 40s with a silver beard and tough, pockmarked skin stretched over delicate features. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good soldier, dependable,\u201d he said of Petr. \u201cHe came here to fight fascism and the Nazis.\u201d The presence of this commander as Petr told his story was, of course, another reason he might not be forthcoming \u2014 and in any case, faced with a foreign journalist who showed up out of nowhere and would be gone in another couple of hours, Petr had little incentive to tell any truths that might make his situation more precarious.He started to talk again of his brother and Anna. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m going to survive and make it back. Whatever it costs me.\u201d His voice had become soft. Outside, a gray sky slowly turned darker; the distant thuds of artillery shells rolled across the glass window with a faint rattle. It was impossible to know how much of our conversation was a performance, or how much everything about Petr\u2019s life was now a performance, a confused attempt by a 19-year-old orphan to figure out how to get home to a country that claimed it would put him in prison for seven years. It\u2019s clear that contrary to what Petr told me, he was an active-duty Russian soldier sent on exercises this summer. Maybe he did do something silly, going over the border on his own in search of money or adventure. Or maybe Petr, along with others from the Ninth Brigade, was ordered into Ukraine as part of an unofficial mission that will never be acknowledged. It was just as Melnikova had said: The true story of the war was like a leaking nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, something that could only be sealed off from the rest of the world to prevent further contamination.Since Petr disappeared back in August, the conflict has moved on. The rebels have neither gained nor lost ground; their territories are neither wanted nor needed by Moscow. As falling oil prices, a sinking ruble and Western sanctions have brought the Russian economy to the edge of crisis, the Kremlin has shifted its attention from eastern Ukraine to its own affairs back home. That means, too, a heightened effort to control information, especially when it might reflect poorly on Putin. The country that Petr wants to return to is one that may have less need for him than ever. He is \u201cexcess,\u201d as Koziakov, the lawyer in Kiev, had put it to me.Before I left Stakhanov, I asked Petr if he wanted me to take any message to Sergey and Anna. Yes, he said. \u201cTell them I\u2019ll come back, and everything will be O.K.\u201d We walked out into the cold, wet air and said goodbye. Petr was headed back to his barracks; he had a shift standing guard later in the evening. I stood for a moment and watched as he and his commander climbed into an old minibus and drove off toward the front, toward a sloping hillside of grays and browns, toward the sound of faraway artillery fire echoing off the damp earth of the Donbass.Advertisement"}

The wines of Eminence Road Farm Winery are practically handmade, unfiltered with as few additions as possible. The 2012 riesling is a bit cloudy and will leave some sediment at the bottom of the glass, but it\u2019s an earthy, gravelly delight, gentle and balanced.The great intersection of quality and value in wine occurs in the $15- to $25-a-bottle range. Here, you can find wines that are not merely sound or decent but fascinating, without breaking the bank. Can you find these sorts of wines for less than $15? Possibly, but the choices rise exponentially if you can commit to paying just a little bit more.In the last few years, I\u2019ve written a series of columns spotlighting 20 exciting wines for $20 apiece. The 20 for $20 conceit was rhetorically neat and made sense, as it took the midpoint of the $15 to $25 range. But this time I\u2019ve switched it up, picking 20 wines for under $20 (yes, the list includes wines listed at $20, but rounded up from $19.99, so technically they are all under $20).Why the change? Because the rhetorical device was too limiting. Continuing to focus solely on the $20 bottles would have required repeating some wines from previous columns, which, no matter how wonderful those wines remain, I wanted to avoid. Expanding the range increased the pool of possibilities.You may wonder what makes $15 to $25 the sweet spot. Aren\u2019t there plenty of good wines for under $15? Under $10? Fred Franzia, the chief executive of Bronco Wine Company, producer of Charles Shaw wines, better known as Two-Buck Chuck, once famously stated that no wine should ever cost more than $10.That may be true if you are mass-producing wine, practicing economies of scale in order to efficiently create a specified product with advanced technology. Big Agriculture and fast-food companies operate on similar principles, which is why it is cheaper to buy a sack of burgers at McDonald\u2019s than it is to buy good ingredients to make your own.I would rather pay more for good food than settle for something cheaper, even if it\u2019s edible. The same applies to wine. Made on a giant scale, wine for the most part is a commodity, sound but uninteresting. Made on a smaller scale, with an eye toward quality, wine becomes a labor of love, with more personality and character than what\u2019s rolled out in the millions of bottles. Is this equation always true? No. More than a million bottles of the Juv\u00e9 y Camps cava on my list are produced annually. But it is true more often than not.The sorts of wines I\u2019ve selected, which speak of a place and express a culture, generally cost more. They require more sweat to produce and more investment financially and emotionally. Their value is in the soul they radiate. If you love wine, it\u2019s a price worth paying.Finding these wines requires looking on the margins. You won\u2019t find bottles from the most prestigious regions on this list. But it\u2019s worth departing from the main highways of wine. In wine and in life, the best discoveries are often on the back roads.Eminence Road Farm Winery Seneca Lake Riesling 2012 $20The Finger Lakes region of New York has become the great American source for fine rieslings.

In Germany, it\u2019s better known for red wine, but this riesling, grown on limestone soils, is simply beautiful: stony, chalky and floral. (Selection Massale, San Leandro, Calif.)Peter Lauer Saar Riesling \u2018Barrel X\u2019 2013 $18\u201cBarrel X\u201d is the entry-level riesling of Peter Lauer, which has become something of a cult producer. Its wines are precise and jewel-like, and this one is no different, rocky on the palate with an almost razor-like focus and just the most tender touch of residual sugar. (Vom Boden/T. Elenteny Imports, New York)Geil Rheinhessen Muskateller Trocken 2013 $17Muskateller is German for muscat blanc \u00e0 petits grains, the classic muscat grape, one of the oldest, most aromatic and least appreciated varieties.

It\u2019s a brilliant Muscadet, full of energy, delicious now but a wine that will age for years. Producers like P\u00e9pi\u00e8re are changing minds about Muscadet. If you still think it\u2019s simply a light quaffing wine, try this and reconsider. (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York)Pheasant\u2019s Tears Kakheti Rkatsiteli 2011 $19 Shinn Estate North Fork of Long Island Sauvignon Blanc \u2018First Fruit\u2019 2013 $18Shinn Estate is one of my favorite Long Island producers. Its wines always seem alive in the glass, energetic and full of pleasure, and this sauvignon blanc is no different. It\u2019s light and tangy, almost succulent, with fresh fruit flavors. It\u2019s called \u201cFirst Fruit\u201d because its sauvignon blanc grapes are the first to be harvested each year.Birichino Monterey Malvasia Bianca 2012 $18You don\u2019t see much malvasia from California, even though the grape was introduced to the state by Italian immigrants in the 19th century. Malvasia Bianca is actually one of many grapes, not necessarily related, that go by the malvasia name. This one is focused and bold, with bright, bracing, fresh fruit flavors that linger.Angiolino Maule Rosso del Veneto I.G.T. Masieri 2013 $17Angiolino Maule makes wines almost as naturally as possible. Aside from a minimal amount of sulfur dioxide as a preservative, ingredients include grapes only, mostly merlot with some cabernet sauvignon. It\u2019s the Bordeaux formula, but this wine, from the Veneto, is very different, lively and precise with earthy flavors of red fruit. Drink with anything.

Fine. Let\u2019s try this: Everybody should avoid this beautifully balanced, energetic wine, full of the aromas and flavors of minerals and dark fruits. Why would anybody want to drink a wine like this? (Fruit of the Vines, New York)Musar Jeune Bekaa Valley of Lebanon 2010 $18 Juv\u00e9 y Camps Cava Brut Nature Reserva de la Familia 2010 $18 No matter what the season, we must have sparkling wine. Cava, mostly from the Pened\u00e8s region of northeastern Spain, is made in the same manner as Champagne, but with different grapes. Good versions, like this one from Juv\u00e9 y Camps, can be great values. It\u2019s crisp, bone dry, almost cloudlike, with aromas of herbs and anise. (Winebow, New York)Pont de Gassac Pays d\u2019H\u00e9rault Selection Guibert 2012 $16This entry-level bottle from Mas de Daumas Gassac, one of the leading producers of the Languedoc, is a superb value. It\u2019s juicy and agile, with a welcome tannic bite and a bit of bitterness that refreshes. The blend is half cabernet sauvignon, 30 percent merlot and 20 percent syrah. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)Bedrock California Shebang Eighth Cuv\u00e9e $15This modern facsimile of an old-time California field blend, made from multiple vineyards and multiple vintages, is spicy and savory and just plain delicious. Unlike many inexpensive California wines, it\u2019s not sweet, oak-flavored or simple. You could call it an inexpensive adult wine, not especially complex but great for burgers, sausages and pizza.Front\u00f3n de Oro Gran Canaria Tinto 2012 $16This red, from Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, is not without tannins. Though its flavors of red fruits and herbs are somewhat restrained, it is robust enough to stand up to a steak. Made from the list\u00e1n negro grape. (David Bowler Wine, New York)Cavallotto Langhe Freisa 2011 $20Freisa is a relative of the nebbiolo grape, and it has marked similarities. In fact, you could easily mistake the mouth-coating tannins and aromas and flavors of licorice and flowers for nebbiolo, though it doesn\u2019t have the same depth or complexity. Still, this wine, made by a superb Langhe producer, is a graceful, delicious gem. (Skurnik Wines, New York)Rainoldi Valtellina Superiore Grumello 2010 $18 Valtellina, in the north of Italy near the border of Lombardy and Switzerland, offers an alternative expression of nebbiolo, from the mountains. This version, from the Grumello zone of Valtellina Superiore, offers complex flavors of dried cherries, tobacco, herbs and spices. It\u2019s fresh, well structured, already complex and a great deal.

Those from the third corner of the sherry triangle, El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, are less so. This excellent fino, from El Puerto, is intensely saline, with sharp, well-chiseled, nutlike flavors.

Now the tables are turned. Companies are rating their customers, shunning those who do not make the grade.Hussein Kanji insists he is not a bad Uber passenger.\u201cI\u2019ve asked drivers to turn up or down heat, to not play music loudly, or to roll up windows,\u201d Mr. Kanji, a London venture capitalist, said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why they would lower my passenger score.\u201d They apparently did. The wait for a ride suddenly became interminable. \u201cFor about three weeks, Uber was basically unusable,\u201d Mr. Kanji said.Customer reviews are a new form of credit report, one that measures comportment instead of finances. Although such ratings have been tried before \u2014 eBay was a pioneer \u2014 the practice has taken off with the rise of the so-called on-demand economy. Strangers may be eager to drive you places or rent you their house for the weekend, but they require some level of confidence. So companies from Airbnb to the new taxi services use reviews to weed out those they do not wish to serve.In response, some consumers are becoming more polite and prompt. But the knowledge that they may be rated is also encouraging people to submit more upbeat reviews themselves, even if the experience was less than stellar. When services choose whom to serve, no one wants to be labeled difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s a Barney world,\u201d said Michael Fertik, the chief executive of Reputation.com, referring to the purple dinosaur who sings, \u201cWith a great big hug and a kiss from me to you/ Won\u2019t you say you love me too.\u201dReviewing customers is also raising questions about who owns the data detailing good and bad behavior, what they can do with it \u2014 and whether people even know it is being collected.\u201cYou take a college class and even though you\u2019re paying, you\u2019re going to get a grade,\u201d said Catherine Sandoval, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates cab services. \u201cYou know that\u2019s what you signed up for.

Buying on eBay is a straightforward transaction with little personal interaction between seller and buyer, and so the reviews got in the way. Now eBay allows sellers to make only positive comments about buyers. But the new platforms let reviews go both ways, and vary in their transparency about the process. Yelp is straightforward: Businesses can post replies to critical customers. On Lyft, the second-biggest of the new cab companies, passengers are vaguely warned that \u201ca low star rating\u201d means requests for rides may not be accepted. Uber does not mention passenger ratings at all in its user agreement but noted in a blog post that \u201can Uber trip should be a good experience for drivers too.\u201dEven as the rules are being worked out, those who monitor the reputation economy most closely believe that the services will begin to meld their reviews.\u201cHighly specific pools of reputation information will become more useful in aggregate,\u201d said Mr. Fertik, co-author with David C. Thompson of \u201cThe Reputation Economy,\u201d a guide to optimizing digital footprints. \u201cIf you\u2019re a really good Uber passenger, that may be useful information for Amtrak or American Airlines. But if you add in your reputation from Airbnb plus OpenTable plus eBay, it starts to get useful globally.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that these review systems are coming. What I\u2019m worried about is whether they\u2019re accurate enough. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to get a disinformation economy.\u201d Will a review system know that someone gets out to the cab a little late because of mobility issues, instead of discourtesy?Researchers are beginning to examine bilateral review systems, where the services and consumers give their opinions of each other, and seeing problems that did not exist when criticism flowed only one way.In theory, the reviewers should say the same thing on each service. But on Airbnb the enthusiasm is much more palpable. The number of cross-listed properties rated 4.5 stars or above is 14 percent higher on Airbnb than on TripAdvisor. The number that receive 5 stars, a perfect score, is 18 percent higher.\u201cThere are incentives that encourage the overreporting of positive experiences and the underreporting of negative experiences,\u201d Mr. Zervas said.One theory: If Airbnb guests seem too critical they might get turned down by future hosts who worry they will be too demanding. Who wants a cranky guest complaining about the noise at 3 a.m.? A better approach is just to shower everyone and everything with praise.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a great time,\u201d Mr. Zervas said. \u201cWhether you like it or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Rescue Economy, Japan Turns to Supermom ", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 When she was pregnant with the first of her three sons, Chiaki Kitajima, an advertising executive here, said her bosses were shocked that rather than accept reduced hours and a demotion after maternity leave, she made a presentation on why the company should subsidize child care.\u201cI had to fight to convince them that supporting me was a good investment,\u201d she said. Ms. Kitajima, 47, is now the creative director of her advertising agency but says mothers at her professional level remain rare.The Japanese prime minister would like to change that. And he has a fix for his country\u2019s troubled economy: the supermom.In a country where juggling work and family has long been especially difficult, Mr. Abe has pledged to ease the way for women like Ms. Kitajima, with more state-funded child care and other measures to foster \u201ca society where all women shine.\u201d Tackling the nation\u2019s shrinking population and declining labor force by encouraging working women is part of his broader effort to re-energize the economy, which is looking especially unsteady after Japan unexpectedly fell into a recession last quarter.His promises, though, will be difficult to put into practice, given entrenched societal and corporate norms. While the share of working women has been steadily growing \u2014 and now exceeds the level in the United States \u2014 they tend to earn significantly less than men. Mothers, in particular, are more likely to drop out of the work force.Mr. Abe must overcome an entrenched corporate culture that prizes long and inflexible hours favoring men, and the prime minister\u2019s own conservative party makes for an unlikely champion of women.A decade ago one of his predecessors, Yoshiro Mori, said women who delayed giving birth in order to work were selfishly \u201cexulting in freedom,\u201d suggesting that those without children should be disqualified from receiving public pensions. A health minister in Mr. Abe\u2019s first government, which lasted from 2006 to 2007, described women as \u201cbaby-making machines.\u201dThis summer, a ruling-party member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly had to apologize for taunting a female legislator with calls of \u201cGet married\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t you have a baby?\u201dAt a campaign stop before the recent special parliamentary election that gave his government a renewed majority, Mr. Abe\u2019s gaffe-prone finance minister, Taro Aso, said Japan\u2019s demographic problems were caused by \u201cnot having children.\u201d Although he did not specify who was at fault, the comment elicited an outcry. The leader of the largest opposition party said \u201cstatements that appear to blame women who cannot have children are unforgivable.\u201dThe United States and Europe face similar challenges. National policies have largely failed to address pay inequalities or create broad support systems for working mothers.But the gender gap in Japan is more pronounced. The national birthrate is just 1.4 children per woman, among the lowest in the world and well below the level needed to ward off a sharp decline in population in the coming decades. And when Japanese women do have children, they quit their jobs more often than mothers in other industrialized countries, leaving a hole in an already dwindling work force.While many mothers start working again once their children reach school age, most take up low-paid part-time or contract jobs. This, experts say, helps explain why Japanese women earn 40 percent less than men on average and occupy only one in 10 management-level positions.In September, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said significant steps to close the gender gap could increase Japanese economic growth by a quarter of a percentage point. That is not small in a country that has averaged less than 1 percent growth for the last two decades.\u201cJapan is using only half its population, so how can it compete internationally?\u201d said Mikiko Fujiwara, a former investment banker who runs career seminars for female employees at businesses and local governments. Demand for her services, she said, has increased since Mr. Abe began pushing his message of female empowerment on corporate executives. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think it was worth the money to specifically train women before, but that\u2019s changed.\u201d Mr. Abe\u2019s record so far is mixed. In September, he appointed five women to his cabinet, equaling the largest number on record. Yet the majority belonged to the most socially conservative wing of his party, which opposes feminist causes like changing Japan\u2019s male-only royal succession and allowing husbands and wives to keep separate surnames. Two of the women resigned in October, facing campaign-funding scandals.One of Mr. Abe\u2019s initial proposals has also come under fire. He outlined plans to extend unpaid maternity leave for up to three years, an idea that appeared to reflect the once-common belief in Japan that women need to \u201chug their children close\u201d until they are toddlers. But such a long absence from work can also derail a career.\u201cThe idea of taking three years off is absurd; nobody asked for that,\u201d said Rumi Sato, a journalist and author of \u201cSugo-haha,\u201d or \u201cAmazing mothers,\u201d a study of working mothers in Japan. \u201cWomen want to know that they can get back on track when they return.\u201dMr. Abe\u2019s most concrete policy moves have focused on child care, which is in short supply in major cities. His government is trying to eliminate nursery school waiting lists by creating 400,000 new spaces by March 2018. It is also working to loosen immigration restrictions that have limited foreign nannies and housekeepers. The government is also debating whether to change tax rules that favor single-income families over those with two incomes. An exemption dating from the 1960s lowers taxes on men whose wives earn less than 1 million yen, or about $8,300. Kaku Sechiyama, a specialist in gender studies at the University of Tokyo, estimates that as many as 80 percent of married working women are in part-time jobs that keep them just under the threshold.\u201cIt\u2019s rational for them, but it discourages work,\u201d Professor Sechiyama said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a subsidy for housewives.\u201dCompounding the problem, women still have a tough time getting ahead at most companies. The demands on employees for long hours and after-work socializing are still pervasive, creating a double bind for working mothers since husbands are less available for child care.Mr. Abe has set ambitious goals. He has revived a largely forgotten, decade-old target of having women occupy 30 percent of \u201csupervisory positions\u201d in business and government by 2020. He is also pressuring \u2014 though not requiring \u2014 stock-market-listed companies to appoint at least one woman to their boards.But Mr. Abe is mainly leaving businesses to set their own course, and there is a long way to go. Over 80 percent of Japan\u2019s more than 3,600 public companies have no female directors.Some businesses have been proactive, by breaking down the strict division between job tracks in Japan that limits opportunities for clerical and other \u201cnoncareer\u201d staff, a disproportionately female group. KDDI, a mobile phone company, has started assigning two deputies \u2014 one female and one male \u2014 to each senior executive, an idea it borrowed from IBM.The company is also offering more flexibility. Kaname Utsumi, 43, the manager of a team of 15 in KDDI\u2019s human resources department, says she was the first woman of her level to return to a management job after maternity leave, three years ago.Her husband, who also works for the company, drops their son off at day care and sometimes picks him up. She leaves work early twice a week, at 5:30 p.m., though she says she usually puts in additional hours at home. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Ms. Utsumi said. \u201cBut when you find a job you like, you don\u2019t want to give it up.\u201dNonetheless, it can still be tough to breach the upper ranks.Shinobu Nagasako, 52, is suing her employer, Chugoku Electric Power Company, for discrimination, claiming that she was passed over for a management job because of her gender. Two-thirds of her male colleagues with the same amount of experience and education are now managers, she says, but only 12 percent of similarly qualified women are.Chugoku Electric argues that the gap is because of differences in ambition. Many women, the company says, have intentionally chosen shorter hours and lighter responsibilities. While lower courts have sided with the company, the case is now before the Supreme Court.\u201cAll the H.R. policies look gender-neutral on paper, but there\u2019s a lot of discretion in who gets promoted,\u201d Ms. Nagasako said. \u201cMen are supposed to work, and women are supposed to take care of the home. So when you\u2019re a woman, you start from a huge disadvantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Decoding the Paradox of Rising Cable Stocks", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market is often an early indicator of major developments in finance, the economy and geopolitics. But sometimes that collective wisdom generates signals so difficult to decipher that they seem contradictory. That\u2019s the situation right now for net neutrality and the future of the big cable and telecommunications companies. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to issue a draft proposal on Feb. 5 for significantly tighter regulations for Internet carriers. But the issues involved are so complex and far-reaching that the market is having difficulty interpreting them. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in the stock market have caught up to events yet,\u201d Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG, said in an interview last week. \u201cBig things are happening. The prices don\u2019t seem to reflect all of this yet.\u201dWhat they do reflect is the critical position that the cable companies occupy as the principal pathways to the Internet in America \u2014 a fundamental role that makes them uniquely valuable as well as extremely vulnerable to regulation and political pressure. Oddly, the value of the cable companies\u2019 landlines has been substantiated by the soaring auction prices being offered for the rights to airwaves used to feed data to smartphones, tablets \u2014 and gadgets and services yet to be invented.Then consider that despite the merger\u2019s evident problems, the share prices of both companies have actually risen since early November. That was when President Obama made a speech calling for much tighter regulation of cable and telecommunications companies because they dominate the most important infrastructure for content distribution and communications in the 21st century, a.k.a. the Internet. You might have expected the opposite to have taken place, but, in essence, those increasing prices are saying that both Comcast and Time Warner Cable are more valuable today than they were before the Obama administration toughened its stance on regulation of Internet carriers \u2014 including big cable and telephone companies. On the face of it, that makes little sense.One perfectly valid way of looking at this is to assume that it is simply a market malfunction and that prices will eventually adjust, downward, once the risks of owning the cable stocks are more widely appreciated. Mr. Greenfield, who recently downgraded his assessment of both cable companies, takes this view. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen with regulations, but the chance that we\u2019ll be facing much tighter ones has definitely gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way that these companies would be trading at these price levels if they were being regulated like the old phone companies. Even if that level of regulation isn\u2019t likely to happen, it\u2019s certainly much more possible now. And that should be reflected in the price.\u201dIt\u2019s arguable, at least, that the Internet is even more important to commerce, communications, entertainment, intellectual discourse \u2014 indeed, all of civil society \u2014 than the old phone companies ever were. Celluloid movies, vinyl records and printed books, newspapers and magazines had an independent life that did not depend on the phone companies. But increasingly, our commercial and intellectual creations live in digital clouds and on servers that are embedded in the Internet. Yet until now, the companies that constitute the infrastructure of the Internet have not been subject to the same regulatory constraints that the old phone companies were.That could change very soon. The president\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t a one-off utterance. Since then, the position of the Obama administration has, if anything, become tougher. On top of that, the F.C.C. has been signaling that it favors a more stringent definition of high-speed, or broadband, Internet than it has used in the past, observes Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. Given technological advances, the agency now considers a basic Internet speed of 25 megabits per second \u2014 that\u2019s more than 1,000 times the speed of the early AOL dial-up connections \u2014 as the minimum standard for broadband service. \u201cThat has very serious implications for the merger, and for Internet regulations,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. His calculations indicate that at that speed, a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would control more than 40 percent of the American broadband Internet market, a percentage that might be considered troublingly high for a critical telecommunications artery. That implies that high-speed connections provided by cable companies \u2014 and telecommunications companies with fiber optic connections, as Verizon and AT&T provide in some markets \u2014 are, at the moment, the only real options most people have for access to a service that is becoming more vital every day. And the soaring spectrum prices may have a broader significance: They suggest that wireless service in most locations won\u2019t be a realistic substitute for wired broadband Internet access, Mr. Moffett said: \u201cIt\u2019s just not a realistic option.\u201dThe core regulatory issue is how to best ensure an open Internet, sometimes called net neutrality. President Obama has said that in an open Internet, for example, there shouldn\u2019t be Internet fast lanes, in which companies with deep pockets pay cable or telecommunications companies for faster access to consumers. Banning such practices could limit cable company revenue. On the other hand, Mr. Wheeler and President Obama have both said that while Title II regulations would give the F.C.C. the power to set prices charged by Internet carriers, they have no intention of using it. The idea, favored by Tim Wu, the Columbia Law School professor who coined the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d is to \u201cforbear\u201d from price setting \u2014 leaving that to the markets, which are usually better at it. The government\u2019s powers would be used to guarantee that this most important communications pathway remained open to all comers. \u201cIt would take an epic change to overthrow the market pricing revolution and to return to price setting for the communications carriers,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the intention here.\u201dThat campaign was focused on net neutrality. But Mr. Greenfield predicted that Mr. Oliver \u2014 or someone else \u2014 was likely to start another campaign over price setting if Title II regulations were put in place. The cable companies are not very popular, he said. \u201cI can start writing the script now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe F.C.C. is saying that cable companies have a monopoly but should be trusted to set prices themselves? Really? Any prices they want? Does that make any sense at all?\u201d Government price setting may not be realistic, but at the very least, Mr. Greenfield said, investors need to understand that there are tough times ahead for many communications companies: Some of them will flourish, but the market has certainly become much more risky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For States That Don\u2019t File Carbon-Cutting Plans, E.P.A. Will Impose \u2018Model Rule\u2019 ", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency will force states to comply with a federal \u201cmodel rule\u201d to cut their carbon emissions if the states do not submit customized plans under the Obama administration\u2019s new climate change regulations, a senior official said Wednesday.Janet McCabe, the agency\u2019s top climate change official, said that the E.P.A. was creating the model rule with the expectation that some states would refuse to submit plans. The regulations, the heart of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, are based on the Clean Air Act and require states to cut planet-warming carbon dioxide from power plants. Each state may create its own plan for how to do so, but the requirements have the potential for shutting hundreds of coal-fired power plants. The proposed rules are already the focus of political fighting. Republicans have attacked them as a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d and governors of some states that rely heavily on coal mining or coal-fired electricity are suing the E.P.A. over the regulations. Some Republican governors may choose not to submit a plan at all, as a gesture of defiance. \u201cWe certainly hope that every state feels like it\u2019s in their best interest to create a plan,\u201d Ms. McCabe said. \u201cBut we have an obligation under the Clean Air Act, should there be states that don\u2019t submit plans, to be sure we\u2019re ready.\u201dRepublicans and the coal industry were quick to criticize the move.\u201cRather than looking to work together to reach common-sense and practical energy guidelines in 2015, the administration is doubling down on its climate crusade at the expense of our economy and our people,\u201d said Mike Duncan, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and the president of a coal advocacy group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. Ms. McCabe said she expected the E.P.A. to release final versions of the climate change regulations by midsummer, when it would also issue the proposed model rule for states. Under Mr. Obama, the E.P.A. has proposed two key climate change regulations: one to limit emissions from future power plants, which the E.P.A. unveiled last January, and the other to regulate emissions from existing plants, which the E.P.A. announced in June. Obama administration officials initially said they would release final versions of those rules one year after proposing each one. But on Wednesday Ms. McCabe said that given the complexity of the rules and the difficulty in writing them, it made more sense to release them together. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear to us that there are crosscutting topics on these rules,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the overlapping issues, we believe it\u2019s essential to consider these in a coordinated fashion \u2014 so we will do them all at once.\u201d Also adding to the delay, she said, was the need to review more than four million public comments that have been filed about the regulations \u2014 a number far greater than E.P.A. officials anticipated, and which they said indicated the magnitude and potential impact of the regulations. Generally, proposed environmental regulations draw a few thousand public comments. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toward a Better Job Market in the New Year ", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHands down, 2014 was the best year for the labor market since the Great Recession hit in late 2007. But it would be wrong to simply root for more of the same. Recent progress does not so much point a way forward as highlight weaknesses that need to be corrected and risks that need to be avoided in order not to backslide. Even more disturbing, job growth in December was heavily skewed toward low-wage work. In all, nearly a million of the jobs created in 2014 \u2014 a third of the total \u2014 were in low-wage sectors, including retail, restaurants, bars and hotels, temporary work services, home health care and nursing homes. Poor job quality is one of the reasons that wage growth has been relentlessly sluggish. Last November\u2019s unexpectedly large wage increase was revised down in the December report, which also showed average hourly wages declining last month by 5 cents. Over all, wages rose a mere 1.7 percent in 2014, barely outpacing inflation. Clearly then, the economy needs faster job growth, better jobs and higher pay. But how? President Obama will lay out economic policy prescriptions in his State of the Union speech later this month, and Republican leaders will have their own ideas, which will, one hopes, go beyond saying no to Mr. Obama and calling for tax cuts. The Federal Reserve can help the labor market by delaying any interest rate increase until clear signs of inflationary pressure emerge in wages and prices. For now, the Fed is projecting steadily higher inflation as the labor market improves and oil prices rise, a scenario that suggests rate increases sooner rather than later. But the Fed could be wrong. The labor market could remain stuck in a low-wage rut while the effects of low oil prices \u2014 including a stronger dollar and global economic weakness \u2014 dent what growth there has been in manufacturing and other higher-paying sectors. A premature rate hike would make that bad situation much worse. It would be great to bolster low-wage jobs with a higher federal minimum wage in 2015 and to foster middle-class jobs with robust infrastructure spending, increased support for public employment and enhanced protections for collective bargaining. At the very least, however, it is imperative not to undo the progress to date with reactionary politics and erroneous policy. Advertisement"}

So why are stock market investors behaving as though oil under $50 a barrel and gasoline prices hovering around $2 a gallon are bad news?But fears about losses emanating from a devastated oil patch have weighed heavily on broad stock indexes, investment strategists say. This response appears to be a case of investors seizing on the industry\u2019s highly visible losers while ignoring the far larger number of winners.\u201cThe stock market has reacted negatively, and some of that comes down to the fact that you can see what the impact is on large energy firms,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s harder initially to see the positive impact that spreads around the rest of the economy. The big benefit to consumers is not as noticeable.\u201dSince the beginning of 2015, the broad market averages have lost roughly 2 percent of their value. The collapse in oil company shares, of course, has been far greater.The Standard & Poor\u2019s index of 80 oil and gas exploration companies is down 11.14 percent in 2015 and 35.4 percent over the last 52 weeks. The S.&P. index of six large oil services companies has fallen 5.2 percent so far this year, and 12.4 percent over the last year.Both indexes reflect the undeniable pain that oil and gas producers, their investors, suppliers, service providers, workers and lenders are going to feel.Layoff announcements, disclosures of capital spending cuts and falling rig counts are all highly visible to investors. So are anecdotal tales of woe from former boomtowns in North Dakota.Less conspicuous, however, are the winners in a world of cheaper oil, economists say. The good news is, they far outnumber the losers.David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., estimates that the economic output among oil companies and related businesses could decline by as much as $150 billion this year because of the oil price collapse. But an increase of about $400 billion is expected in other areas of the economy, he said. The net effect is double the annual value of the two percentage point payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012, which provided a big increase to consumer spending.\u201cThe market\u2019s first reaction to almost any shock is not to like it because it raises the uncertainty premium,\u201d Mr. Kotok said. \u201cMeanwhile, the beneficial effects happen over a longer period, when the change is perceived and anticipated to become more permanent. The difference between temporary and permanent may explain the behavior of the markets here.\u201dTo some degree, investors are operating in an information vacuum: They don\u2019t yet have clarity on the full effects of under-$50 oil.News items about companies mothballing projects that are no longer economically viable have been common: Last week, for example, Royal Dutch Shell canceled a $6.5 billion petrochemical plant deal it struck with Qatar Petroleum in 2011.Still, few of the major oil companies \u2014 which must plan over a long time horizon, building in expectations that prices will eventually rebound \u2014 have disclosed their spending plans for 2015.Another wild card in assessing the impact of the oil decline is the shale oil industry. Because the economics of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are not the same as those of traditional wells, it is unclear how investment and production in this industry will be affected by the price decline.Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics in London noted in an analysis last week that many shale projects had short-term variable operating costs as low as $20 a barrel. Production in such projects won\u2019t necessarily be stopped just because oil prices have fallen to $45 a barrel, he concluded.\u201cMy guess is that in 2014, energy companies spent over $200 billion, mostly on structures but also on equipment,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He now expects that figure to fall by half or more.That\u2019s not pocket change, but capital spending cuts will be small when set against the overall $17 trillion size of our economy. And even if the industry lost half its jobs \u2014 which it won\u2019t \u2014 that would be equivalent to less than a single month\u2019s gain for the overall economy, which added about 275,000 jobs a month last year.\u201cThat completely dwarfs any hits in the oil business, capital spending and oil services business,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said.Investors also seem to be ignoring the benefits of lower-cost oil to small businesses. In December, as the oil price was dropping, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019s optimism index returned to its prerecession average and rose to the highest point since October 2006.The overall economic benefits of the collapse in oil prices are significant, Mr. Shepherdson said. He predicted that it could add almost one percentage point to real gross domestic product growth in the United States this year. In an economy trending at 2.25 percent annual growth, that\u2019s a sizable gain.\u201cThe oil business and everything to do with it is a very small share of the economy,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cCould it possibly be more than 5 percent of G.D.P? No, and the other 95 percent of the economy is saying, \u2018Thank you very much.\u2019 \u201dThe Fair Game column last Sunday, about the benefits to the economy of falling oil prices, misstated the size of the payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012. It was two percentage points, not 2 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, Ignoring Expert Advice Has Been Profitable", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersOVER the last three or four Januarys, the advice for investing in bonds has been remarkably consistent. It\u2019s gone something like this: Beware of them, because inflation is going to rise, interest rates are going to spike and bond holders are going to lose enormous amounts of money. When it came to losses, comparisons were made to what happened to equities in 2008.There were exceptions to this analysis, of course. But for the most part, this view was repeated year after year, with charts, graphs and reams of historical data marshaled in its defense. On paper it made sense.In portfolios, not so much. In fact, the exact opposite occurred: Inflation failed to materialize, interest rates went down, and bond holders made money on their investments.But for investors, knowing what to expect from their fixed-income portfolio is essential. Bonds serve as ballast for rough times.This year, the call is for the Federal Reserve to raise the target rate midyear by a quarter- to half-percent and for trading to push the yields on the 10-year Treasury to around 3 percent. Will it happen? Maybe, but then again. ...Jonathan Mackay, senior markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said recent predictions anticipated a normal recovery after a recession, which would have meant bond yields moving back to a range of 4 to 5 percent. The 10-year United States Treasury bond was trading this week around 2.2 percent.\u201cThis doomsday scenario of significantly higher rates hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Mr. Mackay said. \u201cWhat firms got wrong, including us, is the pace of recovery has been slower than expected. Bond yields follow growth.\u201dBut seen from another angle, the interest rate the United States has to pay to borrow money for 10 years is far higher than that paid by economies that are not as solid. This shouldn\u2019t be. Germany and France both pay less than 1 percent on their government bonds; even weak economics like Spain and Italy have been paying less to borrow money, with both under 2 percent.\u201cPeople at this point are incredibly confused,\u201d said Heather Loomis, director of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u201cThis is the point where people are at risk of throwing in the towel.\u201dMs. Loomis said there were at least three reasons for this situation. First, the global recovery hasn\u2019t been consistent. Those low European borrowing rates have pushed investors in those countries to put their money into United States Treasuries, driving down the yield.Third, that adage of never betting against the Fed hasn\u2019t held true. \u201cWhen the Fed says, \u2018We\u2019re going to raise rates,\u2019 and they don\u2019t, that\u2019s also influencing rates,\u201d Ms. Loomis said.Of course, hindsight is perfect. Given the poor track record of recent predictions, how should investors think this year? \u201cMoney flows to the highest yield and that\u2019s the U.S.,\u201d said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, which has $325 million invested in domestic bonds. \u201cIt won\u2019t be exactly the same script in 2015, but it will sound very similar.\u201dShe said that might not cheer United States investors who were used to much higher rates for decades. \u201cSome mom and pops say, \u2018Who would want 2.15 percent on our 10-year?'\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cEveryone who is outside the U.S., that\u2019s who.\u201dFor investors worried about Treasury rates rising suddenly, Mr. Cohen advises clients to buy bonds with shorter maturities, like one, three and five years.Chris Dillon, a global fixed-income portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price, said this year could bring the return of the historical link between 10-year Treasury rates and gross domestic product not adjusted for inflation, known as nominal G.D.P. \u201cThat\u2019s the alive and open debate for 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes the debate more complicated is the complexities of what\u2019s happening on the global stage.\u201d\u201cUltimately, there is much uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.Mr. Mackay of Morgan Stanley, who says he thinks the Federal Reserve will not raise rates until 2016, is still counseling clients on taking credit, not rate, risk on their bonds. (Credit risk, for example, would be high-yield bonds, while rate risk would be a bet on how the yield curve on Treasuries might shake out this year.)\u201cYou still want bonds, even though yields are going to be lower, as an anchor to your portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cInevitably you\u2019ll get some clients who say equities have done well and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to do. Down the road the equity market is going to collapse.\u201dSimilarly, Ms. Loomis said she had been talking to clients about the need to manage their portfolios with fundamentals in mind, even though certain markets have not been obeying those rules.\u201cI\u2019d rather say, \u2018We didn\u2019t make you an additional 50 basis points,\u2019 as opposed to, \u2018We were managing against this trend and it went against us and we lost you 6 percent,'\u201d she said.In a time of uncertainty for fixed income, unconstrained bond funds promote their flexibility. They don\u2019t have to invest just in Treasuries, or in corporate bonds, or in any country or region. They invest in all of it as they roam the world searching for the best bonds. Some even add equitylike investments to the mix.This is certainly true in some instances, but here skill matters: Just because a portfolio manager can roam the globe doesn\u2019t mean he is roaming it in a profitable way, any more than a manager confined to one class of fixed income is good at assessing credit and rate risk in just those bonds.David Hoffman, co-lead portfolio manager of Brandywine Global\u2019s fixed-income strategy, runs an unconstrained global bond fund that since its inception has beat both the World Bond index and the Barclays United States Aggregate Bond index, according to Morningstar.\u201cWe\u2019ve done generally well because we\u2019ve had the opportunity to select where in the world is the best area for bonds and not just select in one country and get the timing precisely right \u2014 that\u2019s really hard to do,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cMore important for us is what we don\u2019t buy. If you don\u2019t own something, you don\u2019t make money for clients, but you don\u2019t lose money.\u201dBut the style of these funds, even Mr. Hoffman admits, isn\u2019t for everyone, particularly those investors concerned with how their investments are performing against a single benchmark.Naturally, all of this thinking about fixed income may be wrong again this year \u2014 at least that\u2019s the contrarian view of John E. Lekas, president and chief executive of Leader Capital and senior portfolio manager on the Leader Capital Total Return Fund.\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you rates are going to stay low for a long time, longer than people think,\u201d Mr. Lekas said. \u201cCountries are not being allowed to grow organically because of free lunch programs.\u201d Instead of inflation, he is worried about the risk of deflation, judging by indicators in the large and liquid markets for commodities, currencies and Treasury bonds.\u201cThose three pools of money tell me we\u2019re heading to a slowdown and it\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden we\u2019re going to get real pricing.\u201dHis advice for this year is asset-backed floating-rate bonds because they have higher credit quality than similarly yielding bonds. But his biggest piece of advice, and one he employs in his own fund, is to have some cash set aside for fixed-income investments that appear during the year.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got the cash, you can really get ahead of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the money to execute your strategy, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dAs for who will be right, there\u2019s only one way to know: Check back in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Africa, Land Apartheid Lives On", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsCHICAGO \u2014 Friday marks the 150th anniversary of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s famous field order to confiscate 400,000 acres of land from former slave-owners and distribute it to former slaves \u2014 the promise of 40 acres and mule that we so often hear about.In the wake of the Civil War, the United States could have provided a solid foundation for black economic development. But the government failed to follow through with General Sherman\u2019s ambitious land reform initiative; instead his order was repealed by President Andrew Johnson in the fall of 1865 and former slaves were drawn into various forms of peonage, which kept them in economic bondage.Today, 21 years after the end of apartheid, South Africa finds itself at a moment of comparable significance. The country has a land reform program, but its implementation is in many ways undermining instead of promoting black economic development.Due to colonial and apartheid-era land theft, when South Africa held its first democratic election in 1994 whites owned about 87 percent of the country\u2019s total land, although they constituted just over 10 percent of the population. The post-apartheid state has tried to address past land theft through a multifaceted land reform strategy that includes land restitution \u2014 a program providing compensation to individuals and communities dispossessed of land after 1913 as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices. Although the South African government has made significant investments in land reform, the ruling African National Congress has made decisions and promoted policies that are calcifying the existing economic order rather than transforming it.In the course of 150 interviews with people who received compensation through the land restitution program, it became clear that the government\u2019s policy is deeply flawed.Of the nearly 80,000 claims filed primarily by blacks, the post-apartheid state has settled about 70 percent by distributing a Standard Settlement Offer, which is symbolic monetary compensation that is unrelated to the current or past market value of the property confiscated. Such compensation was particularly unjust for former owners like the Majolas, a black family that had owned property in Sophiatown \u2014 a once-vibrant, mixed-race community near downtown Johannesburg, which apartheid authorities uprooted to create a white suburb called Triumph. (We have used a pseudonym to protect the family\u2019s privacy.)South Africa\u2019s land restitution authorities did not give the dispossessed residents of Sophiatown the option of receiving land in their former neighborhood or elsewhere. Instead, the state paid them a mere 40,000 rand per claim (approximately $3,500). In the case of the Majola family, the law mandated that each of the six surviving siblings receive about 6,600 rand ($570), since their deceased parents owned the home. As one family member said, \u201cIt was a case of take the money and go type of thing.\u201d Sadly, these small sums were all the Majolas and their former neighbors were offered, despite the fact that several houses in Sophiatown are currently on the market for upwards of 700,000 rand ($60,000), about 20 times the value of the compensation the siblings received.Although the situation is deeply unfair for families like the Majolas, defenders of the current policy argue that the South African government has no viable alternatives because it has a limited budget and it must spend on other costly priorities like education and health. Others believe that this is the price South Africans had to pay to end apartheid without a full-scale civil war and keep the economy intact.The problem is that white South Africans are receiving far more compensation than blacks.When the post-apartheid state wants to put the Majolas and other dispossessed blacks back into their homes, it pays the current owners market-related compensation through voluntary exchange or by exercising eminent domain. This most often involves amounts that are several orders of magnitude higher than a typical settlement offer proposed to dispossessed blacks. For instance, this month a white farmer was paid nearly 1.5 million rand ($130,000) for 165 hectares in the northern Mpumalanga region. It is patently unfair for current owners (who are mostly white) to systematically receive higher compensation than owners dispossessed by prior governments (who are mostly black).Furthermore, when the government allows current owners to keep their property, they receive a significant additional benefit. The modest payment given to families like the Majolas negates any outstanding claims to their former properties \u2014 effectively sanitizing the property rights of current owners by removing the stench of past land theft, but without properly compensating blacks.Given the state of public opinion, this inequity could have devastating consequences for South Africa\u2019s future. Professor James Gibson of Washington University, St. Louis, surveyed 3,700 South Africans and found that two of every three blacks agreed with the statement: \u201cLand must be returned to blacks in South Africa, no matter what the consequences are for the current owners and for political stability in the country.\u201dSouth Africa may have avoided civil war during the transition to democracy two decades ago, but that does not mean the country\u2019s impoverished majority is content with their lot or that the risk of instability has disappeared.The United States failed to institute meaningful land reform when it had the opportunity 150 years ago, and today we are living with the consequences in the form of persistent racial inequalities.South Africa must not make the same mistake. The country began its second round of land restitution in June 2014; this time the government must get it right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commercial Property Sector Struggles in Japan", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSAKA, Japan \u2014 An economic rebound and altered monetary policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe briefly halted a long slide in Japan\u2019s commercial property market, but the benefits of what is known as \u201cAbenomics\u201d appear increasingly limited to Tokyo, leaving a moribund hinterland.For a while, as the Bank of Japan printed money and Mr. Abe spent it, commercial property investment, a barometer of economic activity, spilled beyond the capital into the country\u2019s larger regional cities.From the beginning of 2014 to July 1, prices for commercial land rose 1.9 percent in Tokyo and 1.5 percent in Osaka and Nagoya, for a second year of gains.That patchy recovery \u2014 prices in the rest of Japan still fell 2.2 percent, their 23rd consecutive annual decline \u2014 now appears to be narrowing.Rents for prime offices in Tokyo continued to rise in November from October, but in Osaka they were flat, and those in all other major cities fell, according to the latest data from the broker and research firm Miki Shoji.\u201cLarge foreign investors are directing their focus to Tokyo, where rents for office properties are clearly growing, which could increase the gap in asset values between Tokyo and the rest of the country in the near term,\u201d said J-P Toppino, managing partner of the private-equity investor PAG Real Estate.A huge city block in central Osaka, the priciest section of Japan\u2019s second city, is emblematic of the problem. It remains undeveloped, except for temporary office structures, since Japan Post tore down the Osaka Central Post Office in 2012, intending to build a 40-story office and retail tower complex.Japan Post has shelved the project while it \u201cconsiders the economic environment and development plans in the neighborhood.\u201dThe neighborhood does not look promising. Within sight of Japan Post\u2019s temporary premises is the giant office and retail complex Grand Front Osaka. That development, which opened in 2013, is 30 percent empty.Though Miki Shoji says vacancy rates for prime Osaka offices fell to 8 percent in November from 9.85 percent a year earlier, that remains above the rate of 5 percent to 6 percent that is considered healthy, and the city\u2019s average annual office rent has fallen 1.5 percent over the past year.That is because there is no influx of outside tenants, said Yasutaka Inoue, managing director at the Osaka-based developer Keihanshin Building. \u201cWhen a big office tower is built in Osaka\u2019s city center, new tenants move in from the same area, not from outside Osaka,\u201d he said.Keihanshin generates 90 percent of its revenue in Osaka but wants to increase its focus on the Tokyo market, Mr. Inoue said.In Nagoya, the center of Japan\u2019s third-biggest regional economy and home to Toyota Motor, the property market was optimistic amid plans for a super-high-speed train service, though it will not be in operation for at least 12 years.The number of office property transactions in Nagoya jumped 8 percent in the first half of 2014 from a year earlier to 94 deals, according to Ichi, a local broker. And the city\u2019s offices are filling up faster than Osaka\u2019s, with the vacancy rate down to 7.5 percent in November from 9.8 percent a year earlier, Miki Shoji data show.But that trend looks unsustainable.More than 3.5 million square feet of prime office space are set to become available in the coming two years, including five major office towers.That would add more than 10 percent to the current total, and one local broker predicts it could push Nagoya\u2019s vacancy rate back as high as 17 percent.Though some prime office buildings in Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka have started to fill up over the past year, rents have not risen. Demand is just not strong enough, said developers and brokers, boding ill for a sustained recovery in real estate prices.\u201cInvestors will need greater skill and better expertise to generate good returns on properties outside Tokyo,\u201d said Katsumi Tanimoto, general manager of business development at the Fukuoka-based property investor Genkai Capital Management.

{"Headline": "Make Forests Pay", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIN the last 40 years, more than one billion acres of tropical forests have vanished, equivalent in size to over half of the continental United States. The rate of cutting, burning and clearing shows no signs of abating.Tropical forests store huge amounts of carbon. When their trees are cut or burned, the carbon is eventually released into the atmosphere, mixing with oxygen to form the long-lasting greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The pace of deforestation is so great today that it accounts for an estimated 12 to 15 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions annually. Economic forces drive this destruction \u2014 for timber, rangeland, mining and development. But there is also a powerful economic argument for preservation. Forests\u2019 carbon reserves can be monetized and sold as offsets to greenhouse gas emitters who need them to comply with regulatory emissions limits, or who voluntarily want to reduce their carbon footprint. These offsets typically are sold by utilities or other industrial companies that have reduced their emissions below a government-imposed cap. The offsets equal the emissions below the cap; their price is determined by supply and demand. The buyers are companies whose emissions are above the cap; the offsets are subtracted from their excess emissions, enabling them to avoid penalties. There is also a voluntary market where companies and individuals buy offsets to reduce their carbon footprint. The revenue is used to finance energy efficiency and other projects to reduce emissions. For those reasons, the European Union, which has the world\u2019s largest system for trading carbon offsets, has not allowed offsets for what\u2019s known as avoided deforestation. Other carbon markets, like the one run by the California Air Resources Board, are considering it.Although this expanse is designated a \u201cprotected area,\u201d it has only four guards. This is not unusual. In the Amazon and elsewhere, there\u2019s not enough money to adequately safeguard protected forests from threats like illegal logging and ranching. This is where forest offsets can make a real difference. Allowing them to be traded would give carbon reserves tangible value that could be sold for real money, which could be used to protect these biologically diverse forests.The added benefit is that saving a tropical forest of, say, a million acres would prevent roughly 367 million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere, where some of it would remain for thousands of years.In our pilot project, a major corporation has agreed to buy one million offset credits over 20 years. All of the money will underwrite a trust fund to manage and protect the forest and help local communities develop sustainable livelihoods such as eco-tourism, fish farming and beekeeping. A second, smaller project has just started in Southeast Asia, and we are working to replicate these projects elsewhere.Corporations in growing numbers understand what\u2019s at stake. In September, 40 major companies, including Kellogg and Nestl\u00e9, pledged to cut tropical deforestation in half by 2020 and stop it entirely by 2030. The group included some of the largest companies handling palm oil, which vow to impose tough standards on production, limiting activities that are devastating old-growth tropical forests, especially in Southeast Asia. Offsets, whether compulsory or voluntary, can be another tool for protecting tropical forests. The European Union and other carbon markets should reconsider their policies. These forests can have a worth beyond the value of their plunder as governments and industries turn to market-based solutions to slow the warming of our planet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Drop in Oil Prices, Washington\u2019s Hand", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneDid the United States kill OPEC?What\u2019s missing from the discussion is an understanding of how the oil market got to this juncture and, notably, who brought it here.Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that one of the main participants in this revolution is the American government.Facing fears of a broad energy shortage, in the shadow of an embargo by Arab oil producers, the Nixon administration and Congress laid the foundation of an industrial policy that over the span of four decades developed the technologies needed to unleash American shale oil and natural gas onto world markets.Environmentalists against any government involvement in the fossil fuels business will hate this, of course. But the collaboration between government and business in pursuit of energy independence offers a valuable lesson for policy makers forging a strategy to fit the current energy imperative: reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change.Many have remarked that the Arab oil embargo of 1973 weakened OPEC\u2019s hold over the oil market by encouraging non-OPEC supply \u2014 from places like Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, which came to market through a pipeline approved by Congress just weeks after the embargo. The embargo also encouraged development of nuclear energy and coal-fueled power. It prompted Congress to pass fuel economy standards.By contrast, little has been said about the role the United States government played in developing new energy technologies. And yet for all the criticism aimed at the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to address long-term energy challenges \u2014 and the derision over its failed investments in companies like Solyndra \u2014 the government\u2019s most useful role might indeed be to support research and ventures that could deliver a low-carbon future.\u201cIf there is one key lesson from the shale revolution, it is that public investments in technology innovation can bring a huge benefit for both the economy and the environment,\u201d said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an advocacy group for sustainable development, in Oakland, Calif.Interest in shale deposits was driven by a search for gas, not oil.But the oil embargo gave them a big boost. Congress passed the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, creating the Energy Research and Development Administration \u2014 which would soon become the Department of Energy.This kick-started a period of heavy government investment in research and development to recover gas from shale. The agency provided funds for \u201cdirectionally deviated\u201d drilling, a precursor to the horizontal drilling used today. It subsidized the development of polycrystalline diamond compact bits to cut through the shale. It performed the first big hydraulic fracturing. Energy Department labs created a multi-well fracking test site.Research at the Sandia National Laboratories into underground imaging \u2014 based on microseismic monitoring once used to detect coal mine collapses \u2014 was critical to map fractures and position wells.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.George Mitchell, the shale fracking pioneer, got help from the government, including in the deployment of a horizontal well and microseismic mapping.The government did not always get it right. In fact, research into fracking initially took a back seat to efforts to produce \u201csynthetic fuels\u201d from things like \u201coil shales\u201d \u2014 which to date have delivered little in terms of cost-effective energy.The government could also stand in the way. Price regulation was a significant barrier to investment into \u201cunconventional\u201d gas deposits until it was freed during the Reagan administration.Of course, the government assistance would have come to nothing without private entrepreneurs who took risks and followed market signals. Fracking was mostly reserved for gas until gas prices started falling a few years ago, shifting producers\u2019 efforts to oil, which could be exploited using similar technologies.Yet Washington played a critical part in the story that led to oil\u2019s recent fall.Supply was kept in check, in part, by unforeseen events: wars across the Middle East, attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria, sanctions on Iran. But OPEC\u2019s big producers, like Saudi Arabia, did not increase production, either. Excepting the momentary swoon after the financial crisis of 2008, flat output from the cartel kept prices on the rise for more than a decade.What brought the arrangement crashing down was American shale oil.By 2013, the United States was already producing 3.5 million barrels of shale oil. Given the new American supply, high prices could simply not hold. \u201cIt was not feasible for the Saudis to defend $100 a barrel,\u201d Professor Hamilton said. \u201cIt was a losing strategy. Fracking would have taken more of the market.\u201d\u201cWe probably won\u2019t see $100 a barrel for a while,\u201d said Jeff Colgan, a political scientist at Brown University who has studied the evolution of global oil. \u201cFracking does put a bit of a ceiling on the price.\u201dAn important question is what this will do to efforts to combat climate change.Just as the surge in natural gas from shale sharply reduced carbon emissions from the nation\u2019s power plants, the plunge in oil prices offers a sobering reminder of the power of markets over policy.Oil\u2019s swoon could feed directly through to bigger sport utility vehicle sales and more driving. It could blunt the political impetus to tighten fuel emissions standards.But oil\u2019s gyrations also offer an opportunity. \u201cReducing our heavy dependence on oil will require us to pay forward the huge return on our 40-year shale investments through a similarly long-term effort to accelerate the transition to fuel cell, electric or some other vehicles,\u201d Mr. Shellenberger said.The falling price of oil offers an opportunity for the government to raise the cash to do so.If enough such Republicans could be found (a risky bet), the swoon in oil prices could be leveraged into a boon in tax revenue that the government could use to pick some of the winners that will help solve the problem.An earlier version of this article included an outdated affiliation for the political scientist Jeff Colgan. He is at Brown University, and no longer at American University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.&P. Cuts Russian Debt One Notch to Junk Level", "Date": "2015-01-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Russia\u2019s oil boom years fading and tensions rising with the West, the ratings agency, Standard & Poor\u2019s, cited narrowing possibilities for the Russian government and companies to service their debt. A looming problem, the agency\u2019s analysts highlighted, was the lack of options for the Russian central bank, which will have to decide this year between propping up the ruble or helping the teetering domestic banking sector.\u201cIn our view, the Russian Federation\u2019s monetary policy flexibility has weakened, as have economic growth prospects,\u201d the ratings agency wrote.Russia\u2019s economy is already heading into a deep recession. The agency said it projected average growth of 0.5 percent each year for the next three.\u201cStresses could mount for Russian corporations and banks that have foreign currency debt service requirements without a concomitant foreign currency revenue stream,\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s wrote.The downgrade cut Russia\u2019s credit rating by only one notch. But that was enough to push the government\u2019s debt into the category of junk bonds.Standard & Poor\u2019s, along with the other agencies, have been whittling away at Russia\u2019s credit ratings since the conflict with Ukraine began, and oil prices started to slide. The two other main ratings agencies, Fitch and Moody\u2019s, also downgraded Russia\u2019s sovereign debt this month, though not to the level of junk bonds.Russia\u2019s government has tried to shrug off the ratings actions. The central bank does not formally recognize Western ratings for some banking transactions. Separately, Russia has tried to create a joint ratings agency with China to supplant the three big Western ratings giants.But even the single downgrade by Standard & Poor\u2019s could ripple widely through Russia\u2019s economy. It will force many bond funds permitted to own only investment-grade securities to sell Russian debt.The ratings downgrade had been anticipated for weeks, and yet after its publication on Monday the ruble plunged to new lows against the dollar. The currency fell about 7 percent in after-hours trading to more than 68 rubles to the dollar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters Out to Reclaim King\u2019s Legacy, but in Era That Defies Comparison ", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the eve of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday, protesters mobilized by the shooting deaths of young blacks and outraged about racial inequality are evoking his work, denouncing what they say is an attempt to sanitize his message and using the hashtag #ReclaimMLK hoping to rekindle a new movement for social change.The iconic images of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. come from an era when he was confronting legalized discrimination, and communication tools included mimeographed fliers and the holy grail of a network television report. Protesters today cite myriad ills embedded in the economy and culture and spread their messages instantly through websites, Twitter hashtags and text messages.And at a time of widespread social unrest over race and inequality, the King holiday on Monday is highlighting both the power of Dr. King\u2019s vision, brought to the public again in the film \u201cSelma,\u201d and the enormous difficulties of forging a new movement along similar lines.Nonetheless, today\u2019s protesters are embracing Dr. King\u2019s spirit and the tactics of his era with a sense of commitment that has not existed, perhaps, for decades.\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of disrupting white supremacy,\u201d said Wazi Davis, 23, a student at San Francisco State University, who has helped organize protests in the Bay Area. \u201cWe look toward historical tactics. The Montgomery bus boycott, the sit-ins \u2014 those tactics were all about disruption.\u201dWhat is far less clear is whether today\u2019s protesters have the ability, or even the intention, to build an organized movement capable of creating social change.David J. Garrow, a historian and the author of \u201cBearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,\u201d said the impromptu protests that had erupted in recent months were not comparable to the strategies used by civil rights groups of the 1960s, which had clear goals such as winning the right to vote or the right to eat at a segregated lunch counter. \u201cYou could call it rebellious, or you could call it irrational,\u201d Mr. Garrow said of the new waves of protests. \u201cThere has not been a rational analysis in how does A and B advance your policy change X and Y?\u201dMr. Garrow compared the protesters to those of Occupy Wall Street. \u201cOccupy had a staying power of, what, six months?\u201d Mr. Garrow said. \u201cThree years later, is there any remaining footprint from Occupy? Not that I\u2019m aware of.\u201dAfter the deaths of Mr. Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in Staten Island and others, protests have included angry marches and mass \u201cdie-ins\u201d in streets and public buildings. They have grown to include actions like \u201cBlack Brunch,\u201d in which protesters have confronted white diners in upscale restaurants. On Thursday, several dozen people shut down a major highway carrying suburbanites into Boston by attaching themselves to 1,200-pound drums filled with concrete and standing in the middle of Interstate 93.Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston and other officials called the protests dangerous and counterproductive, and asked protesters to reconsider their methods. And many, even those who are sympathetic, say today\u2019s protesters run the risk of alienating people rather than persuading them through their tactics.But the protesters say civil disobedience and disruption were also at the heart of Dr. King\u2019s vision.\u201cWe really feel that Dr. King\u2019s legacy has been clouded by efforts to soften and sanitize that legacy,\u201d said Mervyn Marcano, a spokesman for Ferguson Action.It is not only the new wave of protesters that is linking last year\u2019s police shootings to this year\u2019s holiday. At many of the official commemorations \u2014 breakfasts and worship services around the country \u2014 speakers are expected to talk about Ferguson. And the issue has made its way into much of the conversation about the holiday.Many see themselves as building a new movement that goes well beyond what some called the \u201crespectability politics\u201d of civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, powerful figures like Oprah Winfrey and politicians like President Obama.\u201cWe don\u2019t need people shifting the blame to poor black and brown communities for these tragedies,\u201d said Daniel Camacho, 24, a divinity student from Long Island, who has participated in some of the protests in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough people complain about sagging pants, gangster music, fatherlessness, black-on-black crime. Who\u2019s focusing on holding the American state, the police, fully accountable?\u201dSome older blacks are sympathetic but skeptical.Others were more supportive. The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, said that \u201cI was in their shoes some years ago\u201d and that \u201cin the \u201960s, we did some unconventional protesting as well.\u201d Mr. Butterfield is leading about a dozen black members of Congress to Ferguson on Sunday for a worship service at which they plan to \u201cshow the people of Ferguson the relationship between Dr. King\u2019s nonviolent, visionary protest movement and conditions in Ferguson.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s a new generation of young African-Americans who want opportunity, who want justice and who don\u2019t believe in gradualism, just as Dr. King didn\u2019t believe in gradualism.\u201dOthers note that the differing agendas now reflect similar rifts in Dr. King\u2019s era, when the civil rights movement was tested as younger protesters from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee became impatient with Dr. King\u2019s more conservative tactics.Regarding today\u2019s wave of protesters, Ms. Lowery said, \u201cThey are saying that black lives matter, and that\u2019s a concrete message to me.\u201d She added that some of their disruptive techniques could be effective \u201cif they do it steady, if they do it lovingly.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Sharpton said some forms of protest are more effective than others. \u201cI think some of them are absolutely what we need,\u201d he said. Of others, he said: \u201cI think some of them are hustling the media, they have no real following, no real intent, and they may not be around in four months.\u201dAnd many protesters say that following Dr. King\u2019s script is not enough, that the current moment demands a new form of activism, even if getting there might prove a messy, uncertain process.Jewels Smith, a comic book writer in Brooklyn, said the implication that social changes can come only through legislation is \u201cinherently problematic,\u201d for many black Americans. \u201cWe were considered property, then we were considered partially human beings, then we had Jim Crow and now we are in the prison industrial complex.\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe law for black people is really contentious. For the most part it hasn\u2019t really worked for us.\u201dMichael Paulson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Love of Carbon", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt should come as no surprise that the very first move of the new Republican Senate is an attempt to push President Obama into approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canadian tar sands. After all, debts must be paid, and the oil and gas industry \u2014 which gave 87 percent of its 2014 campaign contributions to the G.O.P. \u2014 expects to be rewarded for its support.But why is this environmentally troubling project an urgent priority in a time of plunging world oil prices? Well, the party line, from people like Mitch McConnell, the new Senate majority leader, is that it\u2019s all about jobs. And it\u2019s true: Building Keystone XL could slightly increase U.S. employment. In fact, it might replace almost 5 percent of the jobs America has lost because of destructive cuts in federal spending, which were in turn the direct result of Republican blackmail over the debt ceiling.Oh, and don\u2019t tell me that the cases are completely different. You can\u2019t consistently claim that pipeline spending creates jobs while government spending doesn\u2019t.Let\u2019s back up for a minute and discuss economic principles.For more than seven years \u2014 ever since the Bush-era housing and debt bubbles burst \u2014 the United States economy has suffered from inadequate demand. Total spending just hasn\u2019t been enough to fully employ the nation\u2019s resources. In such an environment, anything that increases spending creates jobs. And if private spending is depressed, a temporary rise in public spending can and should take its place. That\u2019s why a great majority of economists believe that the Obama stimulus did, in fact, reduce the unemployment rate compared with what it would have been without that stimulus. From the beginning, however, Republican leaders have held the opposite view, insisting that we should slash public spending in the face of high unemployment. And they\u2019ve gotten their way: The years after 2010, when Republicans took control of the House, were marked by an unprecedented decline in real government spending per capita, which leveled off only in 2014. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that this kind of fiscal austerity in a depressed economy is destructive; if the economic news has been better lately, it\u2019s probably in part because of the fact that federal, state and local governments have finally stopped cutting. And spending cuts have, in particular, cost a lot of jobs. When the Congressional Budget Office was asked how many jobs would be lost because of the sequester \u2014 the big cuts in federal spending that Republicans extracted in 2011 by threatening to push America into default \u2014 its best estimate was 900,000. And that\u2019s only part of the total loss.Needless to say, the guilty parties here will never admit that they were wrong. But if you look at their behavior closely, you see clear signs that they don\u2019t really believe in their own doctrine.Consider, for example, the case of military spending. When it comes to possible cuts in defense contracts, politicians who loudly proclaim that every dollar the government spends comes at the expense of the private sector suddenly begin talking about all the jobs that will be destroyed. They even begin talking about the multiplier effect, as reduced spending by defense workers leads to job losses in other industries. This is the phenomenon former Representative Barney Frank dubbed \u201cweaponized Keynesianism.\u201dAnd the argument being made for Keystone XL is very similar; call it \u201ccarbonized Keynesianism.\u201d Yes, approving the pipeline would mobilize some money that would otherwise have sat idle, and in so doing create some jobs \u2014 42,000 during the construction phase, according to the most widely cited estimate. (Once completed, the pipeline would employ only a few dozen workers.) But government spending on roads, bridges and schools would do the same thing. And the job gains from the pipeline would, as I said, be only a tiny fraction \u2014 less than 5 percent \u2014 of the job losses from sequestration, which in turn are only part of the damage done by spending cuts in general. If Mr. McConnell and company really believe that we need more spending to create jobs, why not support a push to upgrade America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure?So what should be done about Keystone XL? If you believe that it would be environmentally damaging \u2014 which I do \u2014 then you should be against it, and you should ignore the claims about job creation. The numbers being thrown around are tiny compared with the country\u2019s overall work force. And in any case, the jobs argument for the pipeline is basically a sick joke coming from people who have done all they can to destroy American jobs \u2014 and are now employing the very arguments they used to ridicule government job programs to justify a big giveaway to their friends in the fossil fuel industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Further Tightens Grip on the Internet", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Jing Yuechen, the founder of an Internet start-up here in the Chinese capital, has no interest in overthrowing the Communist Party. But these days she finds herself cursing the nation\u2019s smothering cyberpolice as she tries \u2014 and fails \u2014 to browse photo-sharing websites like Flickr and struggles to stay in touch with the Facebook friends she has made during trips to France, India and Singapore.Gmail has become almost impossible to use here, and in recent weeks the authorities have gummed up Astrill, the software Ms. Jing and countless others depended on to circumvent the Internet restrictions that Western security analysts refer to as the Great Firewall.\u201cIf it was legal to protest and throw rotten eggs on the street, I\u2019d definitely be up for that,\u201d Ms. Jing, 25, said.But earlier this week, after a number of V.P.N. companies, including StrongVPN and Golden Frog, complained that the Chinese government had disrupted their services with unprecedented sophistication, a senior official for the first time acknowledged its hand in the attacks and implicitly promised more of the same.The move to disable some of the most widely used V.P.N.s has provoked a torrent of outrage among video artists, entrepreneurs and professors who complain that in its quest for so-called cybersovereignty \u2014 Beijing\u2019s euphemism for online filtering \u2014 the Communist Party is stifling the innovation and productivity needed to revive the Chinese economy at a time of slowing growth.\u201cI need to stay tuned into the rest of the world,\u201d said Henry Yang, 25, the international news editor of a state-owned media company who uses Facebook to follow American broadcasters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re like frogs being slowly boiled in a pot.\u201dThe recent disabling of several widely used V.P.N.s has made it difficult for company employees to use collaborative programs like Google Docs, although some people have found workarounds \u2014 for the time being.Chinese authorities have long had the ability to interfere with V.P.N.s, but their interest in disrupting such programs has mounted alongside the government\u2019s drive for cybersovereignty, especially since President Xi Jinping came to power two years ago. Lu Wei, the propaganda official Mr. Xi appointed as Internet czar, has been unapologetic in promoting the notion that China has the right to block a wide array of online content.\u201cThis is just a further, logical step,\u201d said the co-founder, who requested anonymity to avoid government scrutiny. \u201cThe authorities are hellbent on establishing cybersovereignty in China. If you look at what has taken place since last summer it is quite astounding.\u201dBut such claims have by and large fallen on deaf ears, especially given Beijing\u2019s strident campaign against the \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d it says are seeking to undermine the country through the Internet.In recent weeks, a number of Chinese academics have gone online to express their frustrations, particularly over their inability to reach Google Scholar, a search engine that provides links to millions of scholarly papers from around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the Middle Ages,\u201d Zhang Qian, a naval historian, complained on the microblog service Sina Weibo.In an essay that has been circulating on social media, one biologist described how the unending scramble to find ways around website blockages was sapping colleagues\u2019 energy.\u201cIt\u2019s completely ridiculous,\u201d he wrote of the wasted hours spent researching and downloading V.P.N. software that works. \u201cFor a nation that professes to respect science and wants to promote scientific learning, such barriers suggest little respect for the people actually engaged in science.\u201dThe vast majority of Chinese Internet users, especially those not fluent in English and other foreign languages, have little interest in vaulting the digital firewall. But those who require access to an unfiltered Internet are the very people Beijing has been counting on to transform the nation\u2019s low-end manufacturing economy into one fueled by entrepreneurial innovation.Illustrating such contradictions, the central government this week announced a series of programs that seek to lure more international business talent by easing visa requirements and through other incentives.Those goals, however, will not be helped by the assaults on Internet access, critics say. Avery Goldstein, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Pennsylvania, said the growing online constraints would not only dissuade expatriates from relocating here, but could also compel ambitious young Chinese studying abroad to look elsewhere for jobs. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t able to get the information to do their jobs, the best of the best might simply decide not to go home,\u201d he said.For those who have already returned to China and who crave membership in an increasingly globalized world, the prospect of making do with a circumscribed Internet is dispiriting. Coupled with the unrelenting air pollution and the crackdown on political dissent, a number of Chinese said the blocking of V.P.N.s could push them over the edge.\u201cIt\u2019s as if we\u2019re shutting down half our brains,\u201d said Chin-Chin Wu, an artist who spent almost a decade in Paris and who promotes her work online. \u201cI think that the day that information from the outside world becomes completely inaccessible in China, a lot of people will choose to leave.\u201dChen Jiehao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Luxury Deals as Euro Falls", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe strong dollar and threat of deflation may be wreaking havoc on European economies, but as an American consumer it has made me feel flush.At the elegantly minimalist Madison Avenue outlet for the Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, Corey Easley, a salesman, showed me several suits and jackets in my size (European 52) in the ethereal fabrics for which Cucinelli is famous.And this being January, they were 40 percent off. A soft gray \u201clarge check\u201d suit was marked down to $2,670 from $4,450. But a Cucinelli spokeswoman told me this was a slight increase from last year, reflecting higher material and labor costs, and the markdown was seasonal, one of two annual sales. The price didn\u2019t have anything to do with the strong dollar.So much for bargains.It turns out that retail pricing, especially for highly differentiated luxury brands with already fat profit margins, is far more complicated than just looking up the latest exchange rates.Naturally, this being economics, all else isn\u2019t equal.\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening with the goods you describe, and more generally it will only cause, on average, a 1 or 2 percent decline in the United States prices of imported goods after a 10 percent dollar appreciation,\u201d he said. Economists refer to this phenomenon as \u201cincomplete exchange rate pass-through.\u201dWhy that would be is the subject of much academic research, but, using wine as an example, as the euro declines, the \u201cmarkups are also changing,\u201d he said.\u201cThe wine producer will increase its markup in the United States, canceling out the decline in marginal cost,\u201d he said. \u201cFrench firms will not fully pass through the benefits of a stronger dollar to United States consumers, but will get a cut from it in the form of higher markups.\u201dAlison Kenney Paul, vice chairwoman for the retail and distribution sector for the consulting and accounting firm Deloitte, agreed that many European producers of luxury goods were using the strong dollar to pad their margins.\u201cDemand is good enough that they\u2019ll just take the exchange arbitrage and put it into higher margins,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cYou may never see a price difference, and prices could keep inching up. The folks who are buying these brands aren\u2019t that price-sensitive. The luxury of having a great global brand is that you don\u2019t have to rely on price incentives.\u201d(While bigger profit margins may not do much for consumers, they should be great for profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of European exporters to the United States.)Ms. Paul noted that there was also a lag between a change in exchange rates and consumer prices. \u201cThe supply chain for automobiles or even wine is quite extended,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in the pipeline already. It may take six months or more before you start seeing an effect.\u201d Bordeaux wine producers, for example, are expected to announce prices this spring for the 2014 vintage, most of which won\u2019t appear on retail shelves for several years.Harald Hendrikse, European auto analyst for Morgan Stanley in London, said that Porsche was something of a special case, even among luxury automakers. \u201cPorsche has the highest margins in the world. It\u2019s not a high-volume manufacturer,\u201d he said. With demand growing and manufacturing already near capacity, \u201cthey don\u2019t really have any incentive to cut prices.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to get a tremendous benefit on the margins,\u201d he continued.While I didn\u2019t find any bargains among the specific items I went looking for, I did find some on other products, even luxury brands, in the same categories. Sherry-Lehmann was offering a case of 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Cabri\u00e8res Cuv\u00e9e Tradition, another Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, for $399.95 (about $33 a bottle), marked down from $559.35. It was throwing in a free magnum (the size of two regular bottles) to boot.Alex Casella, director of wine sourcing for Vinfolio, said buyers who stockpiled French wines, betting on future price increases, were taking advantage of exchange rates to release stocks now at lower prices. \u201cOlder vintages of Bordeaux, the \u201909s, \u201910s, even the \u201905s, are where we\u2019re seeing some great deals right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much movement yet in the midtier wines, like the Vieux T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe.\u201dBut Mr. Colman agreed that older Bordeaux vintages coming out of warehouses may be the first to show the effects of the weak euro. \u201cAfter that, you may start to see declines in other categories,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competition out there, and I think people in the supply chain have good reason to keep prices down and try to gain market share. It would be great to see prices take a break. I\u2019d drink to that.\u201dAmong luxury automakers, Mercedes-Benz and BMW appear to be in a fierce battle for the crown of best-selling premium import, and they were offering big incentives in December \u2014 up to $5,000 per car in the case of Mercedes and $6,000 for BMW, according to Mr. Hendrikse of Morgan Stanley. Some of this may be seasonal, since the end of the year is typically a good time to buy a car. But he noted that the incentives were higher than in the past.\u201cThe reality is that every carmaker around the globe is facing lower costs thanks to the dollar, except those producing in the United States,\u201d Mr. Hendrikse said. \u201cSo there is going to be more price competition.\u201dAs Ms. Paul of Deloitte told me, some bargains are likely to materialize, but \u201cif you want to find them, you\u2019re going to have to look harder.\u201dAfter my trip to the Cucinelli boutique, I visited the sixth floor of Barneys, just across the street, where the store features its high-end imported brands. An Isaia sports jacket from Italy in a beautiful fabric that fit perfectly was 60 percent off at $1,149, marked down from $2,895.Tempting, but I didn\u2019t buy it. At least not yet.Advertisement"}

By depressing oil prices, Saudi Arabia has given him a boost at home. The Saudis have helped Mr. Obama abroad as well, because those lowered prices help pressure Iran over its nuclear ambitions and Russia over its aggression in Ukraine. As a result, Obama administration officials are treading carefully as they navigate the Saudi succession.And the interests of the two countries tend to diverge on other issues, especially combating Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, which receive some of their funding from Saudi sources. \u201cI think the Saudis and the Americans have developed the habit of coexisting with their disagreements,\u201d said Khalid al-Dakhil, a political-science professor in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.White House officials said they were confident that the United States and Saudi Arabia would continue to work together on a range of issues, including the fight against the Islamic State and the response to the recent instability in Yemen. And they said the relationship had improved in recent months, in part because of Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State, a campaign that Saudi Arabia has joined and that King Salman\u2019s ascension to the throne was not expected to derail.\u201cWe are much closer now,\u201d a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we are completely aligned, but it\u2019s far less than it was at times.\u201dOthers are not so sure.\u201cThe recent shift in Saudi regional and foreign relations is not how outspoken it has become, but how muscular it has become,\u201d said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. \u201cIt has long prided itself on acting behind the scenes.\u201dAn annual \u201cintelligence\u201d dinner at a hotel in Washington every year illustrates that point. The host is the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, the guests a group of American and Arab spies and intelligence officials, Middle East policy experts and top national security officials in the American government like John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director who served as the agency\u2019s Saudi Arabia station chief in the late 1990s. Save welcoming remarks by Mr. al-Jubeir, there is no set program, no keynote speech, just high-level national security officials and foreign policy experts networking. Attendees describe the affairs as a Saudi show of force.\u201cThere\u2019s no desire even to talk to the gathered public,\u201d said one foreign policy expert who attended last year\u2019s dinner, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t want to lose his invitation to this year\u2019s dinner. \u201cThe point seems to be to say, \u2018Hey, we can get 300 important people in a room. Now let\u2019s move on.' \u201dLacking American support in key areas, Saudi Arabia is increasingly striking out on its own. Without the military means to sway events in Syria, and with Mr. Obama balking at forcibly removing Mr. al-Assad in Syria, Saudi Arabia used oil to try to influence Syria\u2019s two main backers, Iran and Russia. As worldwide demand softened, Saudi Arabia continued pumping, even as prices tumbled to around $50 a barrel from more than $100.To maintain its own social spending, including $130 billion in benefits designed to ensure domestic stability, the kingdom needs an oil price of $100. But given its foreign reserves of around $730 billion, it could hold out for a few years with lower prices, analysts say.Saudi Arabia has not been drawn directly into the Arab uprisings in Tunisia, which is relatively stable, or Libya, although that may yet occur. Its main problem is next door in Yemen.Militiamen from the Houthis, a Zaydi sect of Shiite Islam and traditional rulers of Yemen, have seized power. Seeing the Houthis as modeled on Hezbollah in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia had already cut off the $4 billion in annual aid to the pro-American government. The United States has seemed much more inclined to try to reach an agreement with the Houthis, at least on the fight against Al Qaeda.But despite these differences, the pattern of accommodation that emerged under King Abdullah is likely to endure. \u201cThe default setting for the Saudis is always the status quo,\u201d added Eugene L. Rogan, the director of the Middle East Center at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford.Still, the days when American and Saudi leaders acted in unison in the Middle East, and when Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador, was the toast of Washington and a constant presence at the Bush White House, are in the past. And if King Salman is anything like his brother, a certain amount of friction will be a given. Late in January 2011, King Abdullah became so angry during a phone call with Mr. Obama over the president\u2019s determination to abandon support for Mr. Mubarak that he hung up on him.Saudi aides were quick to leak the anecdote.An earlier version of this article misidentified the president of Syria. He is Bashar al-Assad, not Hafez al-Assad, Bashar\u2019s father and a former president.Helene Cooper reported from Washington; Rod Nordland from Amman, Jordan; and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "After an Anxiety-Filled Campaign, Greek Voters Consider a Turn to the Left", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLYFADA, Greece \u2014 Katerina Georgiou, 64, who used to own a private school, says that she will probably act out of fear when she decides who to vote for in Sunday\u2019s general election.\u201cEveryone is scared,\u201d she said recently. \u201cAll of our friends are taking their money out of the bank, keeping it I don\u2019t know where. We don\u2019t have any left, so we aren\u2019t doing that.\u201dIt is not hard to see why. The past week has brought news on highly technical issues many do not understand \u2014 from Greece\u2019s ability to benefit from the European Central Bank\u2019s new easy-money policy to the machinery behind bank liquidity.He is untested, a leap into the unknown, and there is no guarantee that he would be able to deliver on his promises or keep from making a bad situation worse.But it is a measure of how beaten down Greece is that voters, polls say, may be on the verge of making just that bet despite a threatening drumbeat from European officials saying that Greece must abide by the creditor-friendly austerity policies laid down by Germany.For many, the past few weeks have been brutal, not only because of the danger of a rift between Greece and its creditors at a time when it is not yet ready to stand alone financially, but also because of the incumbent party\u2019s campaign, which has tried to play on a wide array of fears, including suggesting that Mr. Tsipras, an atheist, would ban religious icons in schools and public spaces.Newspapers and television stations, under the control of Greece\u2019s oligarchs, have fed Greeks a daily diet of frightening stories about what would happen should Mr. Tsipras prevail. His victory would mark the first time that a eurozone country would be led by a non-centrist government, and columnists warn on a regular basis that his ideas and inexperience could have dire consequences for Greece.Each day, the newspapers deliver a tally of the billions of euros that left Greek banks in recent weeks. \u201cMammoth Outflow\u201d read one headline on Wednesday.Some Greeks are furious about New Democracy\u2019s campaign strategy, saying it has done the country\u2019s image irreparable damage by suggesting that once more Greece is standing on the edge of a precipice.\u201cThere is no democracy under such pressures,\u201d said Timos Melissaris, a hedge fund manager. \u201cHow can you think with all this going on?\u201dIt is a strategy that worked for Mr. Samaras in 2012, experts say. And it has clearly helped Mr. Samaras win a slice of the voting population. In an upscale hotel here recently, men in tailored suits and women in fur coats listened to a New Democracy candidate. The country\u2019s fate was in the balance, the candidate said, and the choice they made would determine whether Greece stayed in the European Union or was taken over by \u201ccommunists.\u201dMrs. Georgiou, who was there, said she did not like Mr. Samaras and believed that he had been a poor leader, but she said she felt safer voting for him. \u201cSyriza is the unknown,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Tsipras\u2019s party. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what they will do.\u201d But many Greeks have declared themselves fed up with fear. They say they are well aware how high the stakes may be, and that Greece is still in need of help from the European Union and its creditors, but they have been won over by Mr. Tsipras\u2019s message of hope and dignity.\u201cThe government\u2019s strategy appears to have failed completely this time,\u201d said Elias Nikolakopoulos, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of Athens. \u201cFear does not work unless you begin with a positive message and then use fear in the last few days. They just did fear. Fear the whole time.\u201dPolls have consistently shown Syriza leading New Democracy, although the differences have fallen within the polls\u2019 margins of sampling error. At this final campaign rally on Thursday, Mr. Tsipras accused Mr. Samaras of using his position to spread fear and ultimately harm the country. But he told the crowd of thousands who had gathered in an Athens square that Mr. Samaras\u2019s last hope, fear, was \u201cdone for.\u201dNonetheless, some Greeks are turning away from both of the leading parties, saying that they would feel safer if the winning party was forced to form a coalition.In his bike shop recently, Lefteris Frangos, 37, said he was still undecided but was inclined to vote for another party in hopes it would become part of the governing coalition. Fear, he said, was everywhere in Greece today and one of the reasons he was drinking tea, not coffee, on a recent morning. \u201cIn this situation,\u201d he said, \u201cyou need to take care of your nerves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hearing Pits Tenants Who Denounce Airbnb Against Those Who Profit From It", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a raucous New York City Council hearing that pitted affordable housing advocates against proponents of the so-called sharing economy, city lawmakers on Tuesday railed against an expanding short-term rental market that they said was teeming with abuse and neglect and undermining low-income New Yorkers.At the hearing on Tuesday, which focused on Airbnb, members of the City Council took turns fuming over what they called a reckless enterprise that put neighborhoods in jeopardy and sapped an already-weak affordable housing market. Speaking before a crowd of hundreds who waved placards reading \u201cMy Home Is Not a Hotel,\u201d they variously compared Airbnb to a \u201cmarauding army\u201d and an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\u201cNo one should have to live in a building or next to someone where the apartment is being used as an illegal hotel, people coming and going, traipsing in and out, no idea who they are,\u201d Councilman Corey Johnson, a Democrat from Manhattan, said.The hearing, which focused on how the city enforced a state law barring people from renting an apartment for under 30 days unless the apartment\u2019s resident also stays there, grew into a wide-ranging face-off between two groups of city residents who each said they were being battered by the growing cost of housing.On one side were tenants who said that their landlords had turned neighboring apartments into short-term rental properties nearly year-round, displacing other low-income New Yorkers from affordable housing and welcoming unruly strangers into their hallways. The attorney general\u2019s report in October found that commercial operators, not hard-luck residents, supply more than a third of the Airbnb units in the city and generate more than a third of the revenue. (Airbnb executives say that they have since removed many of those operators.)Audrey Smaltz, a longtime Manhattan resident, testified before the Housing and Buildings Committee that entire floors of her building on West 55th Street were now occupied by visitors who cycled through on vacation. \u201cMy friends and neighbors are being replaced by strangers and tourists thanks to websites like Airbnb and others,\u201d she saidBut just as distressed over the skyrocketing cost of housing in the city were residents who said the money they made from renting spare bedrooms on Airbnb has become indispensable. Joshua Greenberg, 39, a freelance writer, said that housing costs had chased him from Manhattan to Carroll Gardens, to Crown Heights, and finally to Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he now lives with his wife, Karen Wight-Greenberg, and two young children.The couple now brings in one-sixth of its annual income by renting out a guest bedroom to tourists for a majority of the year, without which Mr. Greenberg said his family would most likely have to leave the city.\u201cIn fact, this is our response to the affordable housing issue,\u201d he said during an interview. Members of the City Council sharply criticized enforcement officials in the mayor\u2019s office who are charged with responding to complaints about short-term transient rentals. They complained that enforcement tactics lagged behind operators on platforms like Airbnb.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a reactive group, your office, rather than a proactive group,\u201d Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat, told the enforcement officials, criticizing them for relying on complaints that come in through the 311 system rather than seeking out offenders through Airbnb\u2019s website.Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice, countered that responding to complaints helped officials hone in on the most serious problems. Though the number of complaints rose to 1,150 in 2014 from 712 in 2013, Ms. Glazer said enforcement officials were expanding their capacity to root out the \u201cbad actors.\u201dUnder pointed questioning from council members, David Hantman, the global head of public policy for Airbnb, expressed concern that lawmakers would sweep up resourceful residents who occasionally use Airbnb in their crusade to root out larger operators.He cast the platform as a support for low-income residents. \u201cPeople need to pay the bills,\u201d he said, \u201cand they sometimes take a second or third job, and they sometimes rent out a spare room or their entire apartment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil\u2019s Fall Continues Into 2015, and Stock Markets Shudder", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices tumbled below $50 a barrel on Monday, spooking global financial markets and signaling that the remarkable 50 percent price drop since June was continuing this year and even quickening.The plunge once again sent fear through global markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 37.62 points, or 1.83 percent, to 2,020.58. The Vix, a measure of market volatility that is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, leaped about 12 percent. And in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 tumbled more than 2.5 percent Tuesday in morning trading. In response, investors sought safety in government bonds around the world. As bond prices rose, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.03 percent on Monday.The decline in oil was not the only source of concern in the markets.Worries about Greece\u2019s ability to stay in the eurozone have reasserted themselves in recent days, for instance. The dollar continued its surge against the euro on Monday.Still, as the oil price decline has continued, investors have increasingly seen it as a bad omen for the global economy. The drop may point to lower demand for oil and lower economic activity. And the decline suggests that policy makers have not managed to deal with the threat of deflation, or falling prices.\u201cThere is certainly a deflationary mind-set in the market,\u201d said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist for FTN Financial, \u201cand as we enter 2015, it\u2019s beginning to nag some people that there could be a deflationary component to the economy.\u201dLeading the way is oil. \u201cIt is a very shaky start for the oil market,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cThe norm is a lot of money comes into commodity index funds at the beginning of the year, and that can create a market rally. Today, instead of new money coming into oil, you got some more old money going out of oil.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude, for example, dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years, and Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell more than 6 percent, to under $53 a barrel.The drop in prices has led to a rising tide of oil company announcements in recent days of investment cuts for the coming months. Ensign Energy Services, a Canadian drilling contractor, reported that it would be laying off 700 workers, or roughly 10 percent of its work force, in California fields. Several Texas-based companies that have borrowed heavily in recent years to produce in new Texas and North Dakota shale fields are expected to announce steep investment and job cuts in the coming days.The last time oil and gasoline prices fell this low was in the wake of the 2008-9 financial collapse, when crude oil fell from well over $100 to below $40 a barrel in a matter of months. Energy analysts say the current price slump is of an entirely different nature, based primarily on a glut of oil being produced in the United States, along with increased production in Canada, Iraq and a handful of other countries.While in the past the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has sometimes agreed to cut back production to shore up prices, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers have decided to protect their global market share by cutting prices in the United States and Asian markets while increasing production somewhat.In a recent interview with Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, based in Cyprus, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated his country would remain steadfast rather than cut production anytime soon. \u201cIf I reduce, what happens to my market share?\u201d Mr. Naimi said. \u201cThe price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, U.S. shale oil producers will take my share.\u201dAdding further pressure to prices is the weakening demand for oil and petroleum products in Europe and developing nations. That weakness is compounded as increasingly efficient vehicles come onto the market and China seeks to reduce the oil dependence of its economy.There is little reason to believe any of those trends will change until midyear at the earliest, energy experts say. According to Simmons & Company, based in Houston, the 93 million-barrel-a-day global market will continue to be oversupplied by at least one million barrels a day during the first half of 2015.\u201cIt might be the dead of winter, but it looks as though markets will confront considerably more downside risk in the months ahead,\u201d according to a Citi Research report released Sunday night, \u201cand it will likely take well into the year before prices will bottom, let alone achieve a new equilibrium.\u201dCiti says it is most probable that the oil market will stabilize by the end of 2015, with the Brent price averaging $63 a barrel for the year \u2014 several dollars above the current price. But its more bearish forecast, with a 30 percent probability, is for Brent to average $55 for the year, roughly the current price.Citi has projected that global investments in oil exploration and production will decline up to 15 percent this year, but American companies continue to produce more efficiently. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian global consulting firm, issued a report on Monday saying that the average break-even price for the principal shale fields in the United States had dropped to $58 a barrel, with the core areas of some fields remaining economical to produce at $50.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Peter Eavis from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In State of the Union, Obama Sets an Ambitious Agenda", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama giving his State of the Union address to a Republican-controlled Congress.He called on Congress to make community college free for most students, enhance tax credits for education and child care, and impose new taxes and fees on high-income earners and large financial institutions.Confident and at times cocky, the president used the pageantry of the prime-time speech for a defense of an activist federal government. He vowed to continue a foreign policy that combines \u201cmilitary power with strong diplomacy,\u201d and he called on Congress to lift the trade embargo on Cuba and pass legislation authorizing the fight against the Islamic State.He said approval of a resolution granting him that power \u2014 something he has long argued he does not need to carry out the five-month-old campaign \u2014 would send an important signal. \u201cTonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe need that authority.\u201dHow a handful of presidential actions have been challenged in court, by Congress and by later presidents.\u201cThis effort will take time,\u201d he said of the battle to defeat the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group that is also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cIt will require focus. But we will succeed.\u201dMr. Obama met a skeptical but respectful Congress hours after vowing to veto Republican legislation that would restrict abortion and speed the approval of natural gas pipelines, the latest in a series of veto threats that reflect his eagerness to confront conservative ideology.The president made no mention of the major losses that his party endured in congressional elections last fall, choosing to ignore the assertion by Republicans that voters had rejected his vision. In the speech, he promised that any attempt to roll back his health care law, an overhaul of regulations on Wall Street or his executive actions on immigration would also face vetoes.Mr. Obama implied that the Republican economic agenda lacked an ambition equal to his own. At one point, he mocked the party\u2019s unshakable determination to force approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry 830,000 barrels of petroleum per day from Canada to the Gulf Coast. \u201cLet\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,\u201d he chided.Speaker John A. Boehner, behind the president, and a sea of Republican lawmakers facing him in the House chamber sat impassively as Democrats stood to applaud Mr. Obama\u2019s recitation of the brightening domestic picture during his presidency. The improvements include job growth, falling deficits and the slowing of the growth of health care costs.\u201cThis is good news, people,\u201d Mr. Obama interjected at one such moment, looking out at the motionless Republicans.The president sought to cement an economic legacy that seemed improbable early in his first term, when the country was in near-economic collapse. The speech aimed to live beyond his presidency by helping to starkly define the differences between Democrats and Republicans ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe verdict is clear,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cMiddle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don\u2019t get in the way.\u201dMr. Obama did highlight some potential areas of collaboration with Republicans. He called on Congress to approve a business tax overhaul, the granting of authority to strike trade deals, and a major initiative to repair crumbling roads and bridges.But the president vowed to push forward with policies that have generated Republican opposition. He called for aggressive action to fight climate change and said he would not back down on changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system. He repeated his support for new regulations on Internet providers and for overriding state laws that limit competition for high-speed service.In the official Republican response, Senator Joni Ernst, the freshman Republican from Iowa, said, \u201cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mind-set that led to failed policies like Obamacare.\u201dHitting back at his political opponents and critics, Mr. Obama dismissed as \u201ccynics\u201d those who rejected the lofty vision he campaigned on, even as he said he recognized the criticism of his decade-old claim that there is not a \u201cblack America or a white America, but a United States of America.\u201d He urged members of both parties to reach for a better politics, \u201cone where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter.\u201dHe called on his adversaries to \u201cappeal to each other\u2019s basic decency instead of our basest fears,\u201d and he said he longed for a political reality free of \u201cgotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies.\u201d He said a better politics would allow Republicans and Democrats to come together on reforming the criminal justice system in the wake of killings by police officers in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island.Mr. Obama\u2019s plans \u2014 which would offer free community college for millions of students, paid leave for workers and more generous government assistance for education, child care and retirement savings for the middle class \u2014 are to be financed in large part by $320 billion in tax increases over the next decade on higher income earners as well as a fee on large financial institutions.The tax plan would raise the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent, from 23.8 percent. It would also remove what amounts to a tax break for wealthy people who can afford to hold on to their investments until death. Mr. Obama also said he wanted to assess a new fee on the largest financial institutions \u2014 those with assets of $50 billion or more \u2014 based on the amount of risk they took on.Those proposals would pay for the community college initiative, which would cost $60 billion over a decade, as well as an array of new tax credits intended for the middle class. They include a new $500 credit for families with two working spouses; a subsidy of up to $2,500 annually to pay for college; and the tripling, up to $3,000, of an existing tax break to pay for college.\u201cIt\u2019s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or as a women\u2019s issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.\u201dMr. Obama said that the approach of walling off the United States from Cuba had been ineffective, and that it was time to try a new strategy. Seated in the first lady\u2019s box overlooking the House chamber, Alan P. Gross, the American prisoner freed in December as part of the new d\u00e9tente, repeatedly mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d when Mr. Obama recognized him.The president argued that the United States had an opportunity to strike a deal with Iran to prevent its development of a nuclear weapon, and he made it clear that he opposed legislation \u2014 backed by some Democrats and Republicans \u2014 to impose new sanctions before those talks had played out.\u201cWe lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don\u2019t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents,\u201d Mr. Obama said.And after several high-profile cyberattacks, including one against Sony Pictures that his administration blamed on North Korea, Mr. Obama called for legislation to bolster protections against such computer-enabled assaults.\u201cNo foreign nation, no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, in which he said better politics would allow Republicans and Democrats to come together on reforming the criminal justice system, referred incorrectly to the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. He died after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer; he was not shot to death.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Ecological Boredom", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLive free or die: This is the maxim of our age. But the freedoms we celebrate are particular and limited. We fetishize the freedom of business from state control; the freedom not to pay taxes; the freedom to carry guns and speak our minds and worship whom we will. But despite, in some cases because of, this respect for particular freedoms, every day the scope of our lives appears to contract.Half a century ago, we were promised that rising wealth would mean less work, longer vacations and more choice. But our working hours rise in line with economic growth, and they are now governed by a corporate culture of snooping and quantification, of infantilizing dictats and impossible demands, all of which smothers autonomy and creativity. Technologies that promised to save time and free us from drudgery (such as email and smartphones) fill our heads with a clatter so persistent it stifles the ability to think.Public spaces in our cities are reduced to pasteurized piazzas, in which loitering without intent to shop is treated as suspicious. Protest is muted by dozens of constraining laws. Young people, who have no place in this dead-eyed, sanitized landscape, scarcely venture from their bedrooms. Political freedom now means choosing between alternative versions of market fundamentalism.Even the freedoms we do possess we tend not to exercise. We spend hours every day watching other people doing what we might otherwise be doing: dancing, singing, playing sports, even cooking. We venture outdoors to seek marginally different varieties of stuff we already possess. \u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers/Little we see in Nature that is ours,\u201d wrote William Wordsworth, and it is truer today than it was then.We entertain the illusion that we have chosen our lives. Why, if this is the case, do our apparent choices differ so little from those of other people? Why do we live and work and travel and eat and dress and entertain ourselves in almost identical fashion? It\u2019s no wonder, when we possess and use it so little, that we make a fetish out of freedom.Perhaps we have forgotten the bitter complaint made by Benjamin Franklin in 1753: \u201cWhen an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return.\u201d But when European Americans \u201chave been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho\u2019 ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life ... and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.\u201d In 1785 Hector de Cr\u00e8vecoeur asked two European refuseniks why they wouldn\u2019t come home. \u201cThe reasons they gave me would greatly surprise you: the most perfect freedom, the ease of living, the absence of those cares and corroding solicitudes which so often prevail with us.\u201dWe arose in a thrilling, terrible world. The African savannas on which the first hominids evolved were dominated by saber-toothed and false saber-toothed cats, giant hyenas and bear dogs. When human beings arrived in the Americas, 14,000 years ago, they found ground sloths the weight of elephants; a beaver eight feet from nose to tail; armadillos like small cars; giant lions and sabertooths; short-faced bears whose shocking armory of teeth and claws suggests they drove giant lions and saber-tooths off their prey. A bird in Argentina had a wingspan of 26 feet. Fanged salmon nine feet long migrated inland from the Pacific coast.We carry with us the psychological equipment, rich in instinct and emotion, required to navigate that world. But our survival in the modern economy requires the use of few of the mental and physical capacities we possess. Sometimes it feels like a small and shuffling life. Our humdrum, humiliating lives leave us, I believe, ecologically bored.At times this sensation has overwhelmed me. It happened in a newly discovered bone cave in southern England. The walls and floor were encrusted with calcite crystals that glittered in the torchlight. One of the archaeologists with whom I was exploring it handed me the atlas vertebra of a Bronze Age cow. Then he picked up another bone, this time with both hands: another atlas vertebra, but monstrous. \u201cIt\u2019s the same species as the first one. But this is the wild version. The aurochs.\u201d As I turned it over in my hands, feeling its great weight, I experienced what seemed like an electric jolt of recognition. It felt raw, feral, pungent, thrilling. The color seemed to drain from modern life.I felt it again when stalking up a tidal channel with a trident, trying to spear flounders. After two hours scanning the sand intently for signs of the fish, I was suddenly transported by the fierce conviction that I had done it a thousand times before. I felt it most keenly when I stumbled across the fresh corpse of a deer in a wood. I hoisted it onto my shoulders. As soon as I felt its warmth on my back, my skin flushed, my hair stood on end and I wanted to roar. Civilization slid off like a bathrobe. I believe that in these cases I accidentally unlocked a lumber room in the mind, in which vestigial faculties shaped by our evolutionary past are stored. These experiences ignited in me a smoldering longing for a richer and rawer life than the one I lead.Unless we are prepared to reject civilization altogether and live in the woods, there is no complete answer to this predicament. But I think there is a partial one. Across many rich nations, especially the United States, global competition is causing the abandonment of farming on less fertile land. Rather than trying to tame and hold back the encroaching wilds, I believe we should help to accelerate the process of reclamation, removing redundant roads and fences, helping to re-establish missing species, such as wolves and cougars and bears, building bridges between recovering habitats to create continental-scale wildlife corridors, such as those promoted by the Rewilding Institute.This rewilding of the land permits, if we choose, a partial rewilding of our own lives. It allows us to step into a world that is not controlled and regulated, to imagine ourselves back into the rawer life from which we came, to discover, perhaps, the ecstasy I experienced when I picked up that deer. We don\u2019t have to give up our washing machines and computers and eyeglasses and longevity to shed our ecological boredom and recover some measure of the freedom that has been denied to us.

{"Headline": "In Budget Plan, Japan Proposes More Spending and Aims to Borrow Less", "Date": "2015-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Public spending in Japan will rise to a record level in the coming year under a budget proposed by the government on Wednesday, with higher outlays on everything from health care to national defense.But in a sign that the country may be starting to address its huge debt, budget planners said Japan would borrow less money even as it spent more.With the budget proposal, Japan is trying to balance its need for growth and discipline.\u201cThis budget will contribute simultaneously to reviving the economy and strengthening our finances,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said after his cabinet approved the spending plan, which covers the fiscal year beginning April 1.The key to the budget is a continuing expansion in tax revenue. Although the economy has been struggling, Japanese corporations are earning record profits \u2014 and paying more taxes as a result \u2014 thanks in part to the money they earn overseas.Those earnings have been amplified by a sharp decline in the yen\u2019s exchange rate over the past two years. Adjusting for changes in trade patterns and prices, economists say the currency is cheaper now than it has been since the early 1970s. That makes every dollar earned by Japanese businesses more valuable when repatriated to Japan.The rebound in tax revenue means new borrowing will be a trim \u2014 by Japanese standards \u2014 \u00a536.86 trillion, the smallest amount relative to the size of the budget in six years. Perhaps more important, that debt will be taken on at historically low cost, since the Bank of Japan, the country\u2019s central bank, is holding down interest rates by buying up vast amounts of bonds from the market.The shift is important. Japan is carrying the developed world\u2019s largest public debt load, with overall government borrowing equal to about two and a half times gross domestic product. In some years, tax revenue has covered barely half of government spending, which is creeping up as the population ages.Across the budget, spending is up.Social welfare programs, including public pensions and health care, are projected to grow more than 3 percent in the coming year. That\u2019s significantly faster than growth in spending as a whole, which is expected to rise 0.5 percent. Welfare programs are expected to absorb a third of the \u00a596.34 trillion, or about $814 billion, in overall government expenditures.Mr. Abe has been increasing Japan\u2019s military spending to counter what he sees as the threat from an increasingly powerful China. The defense budget will expand 2 percent in the coming year, to a record \u00a54.98 trillion. Although that is still only about 1 percent of Japan\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 about half the ratio of that in China and a quarter of that of the United States \u2014 military spending remains controversial in Japan, whose Constitution renounces war.One important question for the future is whether average workers will see more benefits from Mr. Abe\u2019s policies. Despite the explosion in corporate profits, wage gains have lagged behind rises in prices and taxes under Mr. Abe, a weakness that economists say needs to be addressed if Japan is to experience a sustained recovery.\u201cMany companies are sitting on idle money,\u201d said Hiromichi Shirakawa, an economist at Credit Suisse. \u201cWe have a generation of cost-cutters in Japanese management.\"If the government\u2019s budget projections hold, Japan will meet an official target of halving its deficit, minus the cost of debt service, to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2015, from 6.6 percent in 2010. But a subsequent goal of eliminating the primary deficit altogether by 2020 will be much harder to meet, economists say, requiring significant further increases in economic growth, taxes or both.\u201cThe long-term fiscal consolidation plan remains unclear,\u201d Mr. Shirakawa said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting on Default ", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe bet in this scenario was a credit default swap, in which one party to the transaction \u2014 say, a bank, hedge fund, insurer or other institutional investor \u2014 agrees to pay the other party in the event of a bond default. Credit default swaps, a type of derivative, can be used to hedge against losses on bonds that investors own, or to speculate on how the underlying companies will perform. If this sounds familiar, it should. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, banks and investors gorged on toxic mortgage bonds that were supposedly \u201cinsured\u201d against loss with credit default swaps. When the bonds went bad, many swaps turned out to be worthless as well, necessitating bailouts to cushion catastrophic losses. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law was supposed to curb speculation in swaps. But as The Journal has reported, hedge funds are increasingly using swaps to wager on whether weak firms will live or die. RadioShack, the troubled consumer electronics retailer, is one of several prominent examples. In December, RadioShack\u2019s total debt came to about $1.4 billion, but swaps outstanding on the performance of the debt totaled $23.5 billion. Similarly, J.C. Penney, the ailing department store chain, had total debt of some $8.7 billion, but swaps outstanding on the debt totaled $19.3 billion. Those gaps suggest excessive speculation, though it is hard, if not impossible, to gauge the precise exposure of funds to big losses. What is known is that a hedge fund that is betting on a company\u2019s default has an incentive to push it over the edge. Conversely, a fund that is betting a troubled company will not default has an incentive to keep it afloat, at least long enough to avoid a big payout. Either way, the company becomes a pawn in a financial game. Speculative activity is likely to increase. Last month, Congress repealed an anti-speculation provision of Dodd-Frank that would have prevented federally insured banks from conducting several types of swap transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve recently gave the banks two extra years to meet a Dodd-Frank provision requiring them to sell their investments in private equity funds and hedge funds. The next crisis will differ from the last crisis in its origins and effects. But it is probably safe to assume that sooner or later, poorly regulated credit derivatives will again play a role in damaging the economy. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Exit for Greece", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Another Chapter 11 for Greece, the third in five years \u2014 and no exit in sight. The Greeks won\u2019t do the eurozone the favor of absconding from the common currency. Never mind that they should never have been accepted in the first place, when they cooked the books to look prim and proper.Nor does anybody else \u2014 including Germany \u2014 want Greece to leave, if truth be told, even though the German leader, Angela Merkel, now has her minions spreading the word that a \u201cGrexit\u201d is no longer an absolute no-no. If Mr. Tsipras wins and then imposes another haircut on the country\u2019s creditors while nixing market reforms and fiscal rigor, then it will be auf Wiedersehen to Hellas. So goes the unspoken \u2014 but ultimately hollow \u2014 threat from Berlin.Unless you overbought now-melting Greek bonds, sit back and enjoy the theater with its two starring antagonists, the chancellor of Germany and the would-be prime minister of Greece. Ms. Merkel, as is her habit, deploys innuendo and leaks. Mr. Tsipras flings wild-eyed threats. He wants to \u201ctear up\u201d austerity pledges and stop servicing Greek debt, invoking the metaphor of the Cold War\u2019s nuclear standoffs: \u201cIf one side pushes the red button, then all will lose.\u201dMonetary war is a bit like nuclear war in this respect: Everyone knows how to start one, but nobody knows how it will end. A Grexit might get rid of a noisome neighbor, but it might also bring down the whole house of the euro.Hence crisis No.3. Athens\u2019s exposure to foreign lenders is rising once more. In everyday language, the Greeks cannot get their act together. Worse, if Mr. Tsipras does win a parliamentary majority at the end of the month, he has pledged to unleash a wave of public spending to reward his supporters.Strangely, this gambit is not irrational brinkmanship. If Syriza does come to power (though at the moment its lead is shrinking), the new government will yield here and there to make nice with Ms. Merkel. But any government, left-wing or centrist, knows one big thing: Greece has a history of bailouts on its side. That will dampen the passions of ardent reformists.By contrast, the German leader does not have Europe on her side. France and Italy, just to name the big two, have been trying to get out from under the chancellor\u2019s whip for years. Unable, like Greece, to bring forward labor market reforms and economic liberalization, Paris and Rome are clamoring for an end to fiscal discipline, which would allow them to allocate their (or their creditors\u2019) money to lavish deficit spending. The Mediterranean mood is working for Athens.Also, with its tiny economy, Greece can and will be saved, again. It is too small to fail, so to speak. But together, France and Italy represent Europe\u2019s hard-core problem, which is economic stagnation over time \u2014 despite a long history of deficit spending.Forget the Grexit issue: It\u2019s Europe\u2019s historical trends that should worry us. In the decades since the economic miracle days of the \u201970s, real growth in the European Union has dropped on average by three-quarters of a percentage point. Productivity growth has likewise slid, to 0.4 percent from about 2 percent per year. These ailments are deeply embedded in economies that lag behind on investment, innovation and competitiveness.Greece\u2019s problems are peanuts, relatively speaking. But Europe as a whole is beginning to look like Greece writ large. This magnificent continent has invented everything from the Renaissance to the MP3 player. Unlike Greece, the European Union is enormously rich \u2014 its G.D.P. is actually a little larger than the United States\u2019. But the long-term data whisper to Europe as well as to Greece: Reform or decline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sweden, the Land of the Open Door, Anti-Muslim Sentiment Finds a Foothold ", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byESKILSTUNA, Sweden \u2014 As Khalif Samantar knelt for afternoon prayers at the\u00a0Eskilstuna Islamic Dawa Center\u00a0on Christmas Day, he sensed a growing heat and a low, rushing sound coming from a nearby hallway. He focused his mind on the ritual, only to realize seconds later that someone was shouting, \u201cThe mosque is on fire!\u201dMr. Samantar sprang through an open window and rushed through the snow in his stocking feet for help. Though about 70 people were inside the mosque at the time, no one was injured. The fire, which gutted the Dawa center, was the worst of three suspected arson attacks on mosques in Sweden over the last 10 days. In the same period, two freighters bearing hundreds of asylum seekers were abandoned by their crews off the coast of Italy, adding to a surge of more than 200,000 migrants to Europe in 2014.\u201cWe left our country as refugees. We were not looking for food or benefits, we were looking for somewhere to feel safe,\u201d said Abdirahman Farah Warsame, the imam at the mosque where the fire occurred on Christmas Day. He is originally from Somalia. \u201cNow that is gone. We have a feeling that society is turning against us.\u201dIndeed, the relentless stream of migrants to Europe \u2014 propelled by the war in Syria and turmoil across the Middle East and the Horn of Africa \u2014 has combined with economic troubles and rising fear of Islamic radicalism to fuel a backlash against immigrants, directed most viciously at Muslims.The simmering resentments and suspicions have driven debates across Europe about tighter controls on immigration. Worries about immigration have helped buoy right-wing parties in Britain, Denmark, France and Hungary. German officials recorded more than 70 attacks against mosques from 2012 to 2014, including an arson, and the police in Britain have recorded an increase in hate crimes against Muslims. There are few places where the turn against immigrants is more surprising than Sweden, where a solid core of citizens still supports the 65-year-old open door policy toward immigrants facing hardship that has long earned international respect for the country.On Friday, hundreds of Swedes gathered outside the royal palace in Stockholm and in other cities to show solidarity with the Muslim population a day after an unknown assailant threw a bottle filled with flammable liquid at a mosque in the northern city of Uppsala and sprayed racist slogans on the building. The firebomb caused no injuries and did not damage the building. But as each day brings more reports of immigrants who have boarded ships and sneaked across European borders, the famous tolerance of the Swedes is being tested as never before.Despite a lackluster economy, Sweden was third behind only Germany and France in the number of people registering for asylum in 2012, according to the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. Relative to its population, Sweden received the second-highest share of asylum applications in the European Union after Malta, the institute says.The Syrian conflict has boosted the number of asylum seekers. Of 81,000 people seeking asylum in Sweden in 2014, roughly half were from Syria, the Swedish Migration Board said.Opposition to the rising numbers is growing. The far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats had their best showing ever \u2014 nearly 13 percent of votes \u2014 in elections in September.The entry of the Sweden Democrats to parliament in 2010 had already opened the door for a previously unthinkable discussion about turning back the country\u2019s policy of taking in foreigners on humanitarian grounds and granting them access to the country\u2019s generous welfare system.Adrian Groglopo, a professor of social science at the University of Gothenburg, has studied discrimination in Sweden over the past decade. He said that Sweden has long been a racially segregated country where many immigrants live in ghettos and struggle to find jobs, but that the success of the Sweden Democrats has made racism more socially acceptable. \u201cIt is a very difficult time in Sweden,\u201d Dr. Groglopo said. \u201cNow we can talk about things that we weren\u2019t allowed to talk about before. It is a kind of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201dLast month, the Sweden Democrats threatened to bring down Prime Minister Stefan Lofven\u2019s minority government. Early elections were averted only through a last-minute deal that observers say granted the anti-immigrant party even more power by pulling it from the sidelines and making it the primary opposition.The party\u2019s growth has occurred despite the fact that roughly a fifth of Sweden\u2019s 9.6 million people were born abroad or to immigrant parents in Sweden. Most immigrants here have access to education, but government figures show a disproportionate unemployment rate for them, more than twice the national rate of about 8 percent. The disparity helped fuel riots in immigrant neighborhoods outside Stockholm in 2013.In Germany, another anti-immigrant movement is underway. In recent weeks, a group calling itself the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West has attracted as many as 17,500 people to rallies that demand stifling of immigration. The group has called for more rallies on Monday, in Dresden and Cologne. Omar Mustafa, president of the Islamic Association of Sweden, which represents about 40 communities across the country, said the recent fires at mosques were the culmination of a year of rising anti-Islamic attacks, from women having their hijabs, or head coverings, pulled off in the streets to the vandalism of 14 mosques, as well as racist or anti-Muslim vitriol spread through social media.\u201cIt is a scary development in Swedish society,\u201d Mr. Mustafa said by telephone. \u201cIt is a big movement that is moving from the Internet to the real world.\u201dVandals broke windows in the mosque in Eskilstuna twice last year and twice in 2013. But Mr. Warsame, the imam, said the mosque \u2014 located in a ground-floor storefront in a residential area of largely immigrants \u2014 had good relationships with its neighbors and the city officials.When people nearby complained about the disturbance of comings and goings for late-night prayers during Ramadan, Mr. Warsame and the leaders of two other mosques with similar problems sought out a remote location for their holiday ritual.No arrests have been made in the Christmas Day blaze that gutted the mosque in Eskilstuna, or the Dec. 29 fire at a mosque in Eskov or the attack in Uppsala. In response, the national police have tightened security at mosques and other religious buildings across the country.The fire in Eskilstuna prompted an outpouring of support for the congregation, including an event in which dozens of people pasted handmade, heart-shaped notes to the boarded-up windows of the mosque in what they called a \u201clove bomb.\u201d The event was organized by an activist group known as Tillsammans for Eskilstuna, or Together for Eskilstuna. Despite the support, members of the mosque said they remained rattled.Mr. Samantar, who is originally from Somalia, said he struggles to get through his prayers without smelling smoke or hearing the rush of a fire. After he escaped that day, he said, he feared that women and children were trapped in other rooms of the burning building, and anxiety haunts him still, even in his sleep.\u201cWe would always take our families with us to the mosque,\u201d said Mr. Samantar, a father of three. \u201cThe mosque was always our safe place. It\u2019s not anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joe Biden: A Plan for Central America", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAS we were reminded last summer when thousands of unaccompanied children showed up on our southwestern border, the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.The economies of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras remain bogged down as the rest of the Americas surge forward. Inadequate education, institutional corruption, rampant crime and a lack of investment are holding these countries back. Six million young Central Americans are to enter the labor force in the next decade. If opportunity isn\u2019t there for them, the entire Western Hemisphere will feel the consequences.Confronting these challenges requires nothing less than systemic change, which we in the United States have a direct interest in helping to bring about. Toward that end, on Monday, President Obama will request from Congress $1 billion to help Central America\u2019s leaders make the difficult reforms and investments required to address the region\u2019s interlocking security, governance and economic challenges. That is almost three times what we generally have provided to Central America. Last summer, as our countries worked together to stem the dangerous surge in migration, the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras asked for additional assistance to change the climate of endemic violence and poverty that has held them back. In June, I made it clear to these leaders that the United States was ready to support them \u2014 provided they took ownership of the problem. Mr. Obama drove home this point when the leaders visited Washington in July.And they responded. Honduras signed an agreement with Transparency International to combat corruption. Guatemala has removed senior officials suspected of corruption and aiding human trafficking. El Salvador passed a law providing new protections for investors. Working with the Inter-American Development Bank, these three countries forged a joint plan for economic and political reforms, an alliance for prosperity. These leaders acknowledge that an enormous effort is required. We have agreed to intensify our work together in three areas.First, security makes everything else possible. We can help stabilize neighborhoods through community-based policing, and eradicate transnational criminal networks that have turned Central America into a hotbed for drug smuggling, human trafficking and financial crime. Some communities in Guatemala and El Salvador are already seeing the benefit of United States-sponsored programs on community policing, specialized police training and youth centers similar to Boys and Girls Clubs in the United States. As I learned in crafting the 1994 United States crime bill, these programs can reduce crime.Second, good governance begets the jobs and investment that Central America needs. Today, court systems, government contracting and tax collection are not widely perceived as transparent and fair. These countries have among the lowest effective tax rates in the hemisphere. To attract the investments required for real and lasting progress, they must collect and manage revenues effectively and transparently.Third, there is not enough government money, even with assistance from the United States and the international community, to address the scale of the economic need. Central American economies can grow only by attracting international investment and making a more compelling case to their citizens to invest at home. That requires clear rules and regulations; protections for investors; courts that can be trusted to adjudicate disputes fairly; serious efforts to root out corruption; protections for intellectual property; and transparency to ensure that international assistance is spent accountably and effectively. We are ready to work with international financial institutions and the private sector to help these countries train their young people, make it easier to start a business, and ensure that local enterprises get the most out of existing free trade agreements with the United States.The challenges ahead are formidable. But if the political will exists, there is no reason Central America cannot become the next great success story of the Western Hemisphere.The region has seen this sort of transformation before. In 1999, we initiated Plan Colombia to combat drug trafficking, grinding poverty and institutional corruption \u2014 combined with a vicious insurgency \u2014 that threatened to turn Colombia into a failed state. Fifteen years later, Colombia is a nation transformed. As one of the architects of Plan Colombia in the United States Senate, I saw that the key ingredient was political will on the ground. Colombia benefited from leaders who had the courage to make significant changes regarding security, governance and human rights. Elites agreed to pay higher taxes. The Colombian government cleaned up its courts, vetted its police force and reformed its rules of commerce to open up its economy. The United States invested $9 billion over the course of Plan Colombia, with $700 million the first year. But our figures show that Colombia outspent us four to one. The cost of investing now in a secure and prosperous Central America is modest compared with the costs of letting violence and poverty fester.Mr. Obama has asked me to lead this new effort. For the first time, we can envision and work toward having the Americas be overwhelmingly middle class, democratic and secure.That is why we are asking Congress to work with us. Together, we can help Central America become an embodiment of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s remarkable rise \u2014 not an exception to it.Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the vice president of the United States. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Governor Seeks New Taxes as a Court Order Looms", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOLYMPIA, Wash. \u2014 Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, stepped to the rostrum in the ornate House chamber of the Capitol here on Tuesday and called for the biggest increase in new tax dollars in state history.\u201cThe time of recession and hollowing out is behind us,\u201d Mr. Inslee said in his State of the State address to lawmakers. \u201cIt is now time for reinvestment.\u201d Mr. Inslee is seeking $1.4 billion in new revenue as part of a nearly $39 billion budget plan that includes a new capital gains tax on the wealthy and a cap-and-trade carbon tax system he said would also reduce climate-altering pollution. The extra money, along with a projected $3 billion surge in revenue from existing taxes in a recovering economy, would be funneled heavily to one line item: education.Though Mr. Inslee, a former congressman who was elected governor in 2012, may well favor more money for schools in any case, seven ominous words are driving his tax-and-spending plan: \u201csanctions and other remedial measures as necessary.\u201dThat is the language of the Washington Supreme Court, the state\u2019s highest judicial body, which last fall found the state in contempt for failing to outline a schedule, in dates and dollar amounts, to fix years of underfunding of schools. The justices issued a contempt order in September, after many failed promises by the Legislature, but held off enforcement until the end of the 2015 legislative session, which began Monday and is to last for 105 days.Imposing a penalty, if it comes to that, could well be a first in American politics, according to legal scholars who could not remember another example of a state high court holding an equal branch of government in contempt. No one is certain what might happen. The court was vague about what it might do, leaving just about anything on the table, and nobody can think of any relevant precedent. The court could, for example, order money deposited from state general funds into school accounts, legal scholars said, or impose fines or do something else altogether.\u201cI\u2019m still left wondering what a court can do to sanction a coequal branch of government where the sin ultimately boils down to the failure to vote for positive social and economic policy that satisfies the court,\u201d said Scott R. Bauries, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who studies state constitutions and education.Equally perplexing, he said, is that because the federal courts do not police disputes between branches of state government over the separation of powers, any challenge to the court\u2019s action could be appealed to only the justices themselves, who would be asked to second-guess whether they had acted within constitutional bounds. \u201cThis order is pretty strongly worded,\u201d Professor Bauries said.The Legislature is divided but is already showing resistance to Mr. Inslee\u2019s pleas. Republicans strengthened their control of the state Senate after last fall\u2019s election, while Democrats retained a majority in the House. On Monday, less than 24 hours before the governor\u2019s speech, the Senate changed its own rules to make any new tax harder to pass \u2014 requiring two-thirds approval of the chamber instead of a simple majority.\u201cThis will make it much more difficult for Gov. Jay Inslee to pass his misguided proposals,\u201d said Senator Michael Baumgartner, a Republican who co-sponsored the rule change. \u201cBy requiring broad support for taxes in the Legislature, we ensure that taxes will not be our first resort.\u201d Mr. Inslee\u2019s tax package would be the largest ever in dollar terms, but in terms of percentage increase, some tax hikes have been much bigger. The state\u2019s top education official, Randy Dorn, said he was braced for disaster. He said that even Mr. Inslee\u2019s ambitious plans, were they to pass intact, might not satisfy a court that was clearly exasperated and tired of waiting.\u201cThat, to me, is going to produce a constitutional crisis,\u201d he said.Court orders on education are common in state politics. Particularly since the 1990s, lawsuits have focused on state constitutions, which vary greatly in their requirements for education. Sixteen states, for example, simply require a system of free public schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Washington\u2019s constitution is one of the most stringent \u2014 one of only eight that call education a \u201cfundamental,\u201d \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201cparamount\u201d state obligation.How much new education spending would satisfy the court presents its own tangled set of questions. Some lawmakers say an increase in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion in the current budget would meet the court\u2019s demands, while others cited higher or lower numbers.Representative Norma Smith, a Republican who spoke for her party in a taped response to Mr. Inslee\u2019s speech, said things were going so well for the state, with new growth in jobs and revenue, that tax increases might not be necessary at all.\u201cYes, we must rectify the failure of the past,\u201d she said. \u201cBut putting more money into the system must not be our only response.\u201dMr. Inslee, in his speech, said that more money was not the only goal. Washington\u2019s tax system \u2014 with no income tax and a heavy reliance on sales taxes \u2014 is also deeply unfair, he said, because lower income people pay a higher proportion of their income than do richer residents. His proposal for a 7 percent capital gains tax would affect less than 1 percent of the state\u2019s taxpayers, he said.\u201cWe can work toward a fairer tax system, and we should,\u201d Mr. Inslee said.Advertisement"}

But traditional Republican opposition in the State Senate, where that party holds a majority, makes the passage of such legislation far from assured.Still, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, seemed cautiously optimistic that an improving economy, including robust recent gains on Wall Street and the stock market, would make it easier to cut a deal.\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, when asked about past Republican opposition, adding: \u201cThe market is strong and I believe the market, this market, at this rate of strength, can deal with this.\u201dThe state last increased the minimum wage in 2013, approving a three-year rollout that pushed the hourly rate to $8.75 from $7.25. That wage will rise to $9 an hour by 2016. But on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo suggested that the rate of increase was too slow, saying \u201cthe wage gap has continued to increase.\u201d Under his proposal, the wage would increase to $11.50 and $10.50 at the end of 2016.The proposal, announced at a news conference in Manhattan, seemingly offered the governor a chance to refine his position regarding differing wages in differing parts of the state, noting it was the first time New York City would be allowed a different rate. Last year, Mr. Cuomo had dismissed suggestions that local governments could set their own minimum wages, saying that letting them do so could lead to a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d\u201cThe cost of living is higher in New York City,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cAnd that should be accounted for.\u201dThe minimum wage increase was just one of 10 proposals that the governor unveiled in advance of his State of the State address in Albany on Wednesday, including expansions in job programs for urban youth, additional funding for homeless services and low-income housing, and assistance for food programs.Taken as a whole, the proposals seemed geared to appease Mr. Cuomo\u2019s detractors on the left in his party, who have been upset by the governor\u2019s pace on issues like campaign finance reform and public financing of elections, and by his lackadaisical support of Democrats in the State Senate. Mr. Cuomo faced a primary challenge in September, winning 62 percent of the vote against a little-known and underfunded candidate.Mr. Lipton also said that Mr. Cuomo could conceivably raise wages without legislative approval, by working through the state wage board. Phil Walzak, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said City Hall was encouraged by the proposal. \u201cThere is no question that reducing income inequality remains the central challenge we face today,\u201d Mr. Walzak said. But he said there is still a lot of work to be done to help families: \u201cToo many struggle too hard to simply keep their heads above water.\u201dScott Reif, a spokesman for Dean G. Skelos, the Long Island Republican who leads the Senate, had no comment on the governor\u2019s proposal.Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Democrat-controlled State Assembly and a longtime supporter of a higher minimum wage, praised the proposal. \u201cI hope we can make it a reality this year,\u201d he said.On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo conceded that \u201cthe Senate is not, let\u2019s say, overly aggressive on passing the minimum wage.\u201d But his supporters in the labor movement seemed pleased that the governor had offered his plan just before a national holiday honoring the Rev.

His death was confirmed by his son-in-law Campbell Gerrish.Inaugurated as N.Y.U.\u2019s 11th and youngest president in 1962, when he was only 38, Dr. Hester inherited extraordinary social and financial challenges, even as he sought to transform the university into a model of urban private education. During his nearly 14-year tenure, N.Y.U. cut spending sharply, but it also opened the 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square, raised faculty salaries and began recruiting students from beyond the New York metropolitan area.In 1972, a task force he appointed warned that without drastic retrenchment, N.Y.U. would become \u201cthe victim of the largest and most spectacular financial collapse in the history of American higher education.\u201dBut only a year later, after imposing recommended economies, he declared, \u201cWe are well on the road to achieving what many observers believed would require a miracle.\u201dThat progress was accomplished largely by selling the University Heights campus in the Bronx, closing the engineering school, paring full-time faculty positions, merging graduate and undergraduate business programs, cutting intercollegiate competition in baseball, football and basketball, and requiring various components of the university, including the school of social work, to pay their own way. At the same time, Dr. Hester raised academic standards and fielded recruiters to reverse a decline in out-of-town students. John Sexton, N.Y.U.\u2019s current president, said Mr. Hester \u201claid the groundwork for the N.Y.U. we know today: a university that is not only the nation\u2019s largest private university, but also the most transformed, from a regional school to a major, respected, global research university.\u201dDr. Hester once explained that he wound up in higher education almost by accident. During the American military occupation of Japan, he worked as a civilian supervising schools. But even as a self-described \u201cprofessional administrator,\u201d he emerged as a national presence.He headed a White House task force on higher education that in 1970 recommended an expansion of federal scholarships, a larger commitment to black colleges, grants to graduate schools and tax incentives to encourage private contributions to universities. Like other college presidents, he contended with campus unrest, which brought unwelcome attention. Until he qualified his support for the war in Vietnam by urging America\u2019s withdrawal as soon as possible, he had been assailed by campus protesters.After the invasion of Cambodia and the fatal shooting by National Guardsmen of four students during an antiwar protest at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970, Dr. Hester wrote an impassioned appeal to President Richard M. Nixon to \u201cconsider the incalculable dangers of an unprecedented alienation of America\u2019s youth\u201d and to \u201cend the war quickly.\u201d It was signed by the presidents of 37 colleges and universities. He also lamented the lack of social contact between blacks and whites who had reached comparable educational levels and presciently warned of the depersonalizing impact of technology.James McNaughton Hester was born in Chester, Pa., on April 19, 1924. The son of a Navy chaplain, he spent his childhood at military posts around the world.He served as an officer in the Marine Corps in World War II, graduated with honors from Princeton, was named a Rhodes Scholar, returned to the Marines during the Korean War and received a doctorate in 1955 from Oxford, where he met and married Janet Rodes.She and their three children, Janet Gerrish, Margaret Giroux and Martha Stafford, survive him, as do seven grandchildren; his brother, Raymond; and his sister, Virginia Laddy.Dr. Hester often remarked that professional educators typically found administrative jobs unsatisfying, but that he was drawn by the challenges, the contacts with academic life and the fact that \u201cit\u2019s all for a worthwhile purpose.\u201dIn 1960, after serving as provost of the Brooklyn Center of Long Island University, he was named dean of the undergraduate and graduate schools of arts and sciences at N.Y.U.He was rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo from 1975 to 1980, president of the New York Botanical Garden from 1980 to 1989 and president of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation from 1989 to 2004. He was also an accomplished painter.\u201cThe world can be divided into those who love New York City and those who don\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Hester said at his final commencement, in 1975. \u201cThose who love New York tend to be unusually lively people. They have to be. Characteristically, they are ambitious, curious, intellectually vigorous, culturally alive. Such people give New York City institutions great dynamism and some eccentricity.\u201cNew York University, by comparison with most other universities in the world, is a much more interesting place because of this vitality.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cold Political Terms, Far Right and French President Both Gain", "Date": "2015-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Amid the horrors of the last week, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is widely judged to have kept his calm, acted decisively and spoken the words of condemnation, defiance and unity expected of a French president, who by tradition is called on to embody the nation.In the days after a series of terror attacks, Mr. Hollande, long seen by much of his electorate as weak and indecisive, has had a great boost politically. As he gathered around him dozens of world leaders for Sunday\u2019s vast rally in support of liberty, solidarity and tolerance, he seemed for the moment to rise to their stature.But no one expects this mood of solidarity to last very long; indeed, the attacks have already sharpened his clash with the far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Mr. Hollande remains the most unpopular French president since World War II. He is troubled by a weak economy, high unemployment and an underlying atmosphere of anxiety and even fear, among both Muslims and Jews, about the impact of homegrown Islamic radicalism. In coming weeks, he and his government are certain to confront painful questions about intelligence and security lapses and whether the carnage of last week could have been averted.\u201cHollande has been extremely good in this crisis, showing calm and self-control, and using all the right words,\u201d said Alain Frachon, an editorial writer for Le Monde. \u201cIf we do a cold, cynical political analysis, he did rather well. Afterwards, of course, all these questions will be raised about security failures and the future.\u201dIf Mr. Hollande has gotten a small boost from these terrible few days, however, so have Ms. Le Pen and the far-right National Front, which has made the challenge of radical Islam to France the center of their politics. Even before the attacks, her brand of nationalistic French populism had helped make her a credible contender to succeed Mr. Hollande in the 2017 election.The homegrown terrorism here, with its apparent links to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, will also be used by other far-right, nationalist and anti-immigration movements in Europe, from the United Kingdom Independence Party to the Sweden Democrats and Germany\u2019s Pegida \u2014 Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. That is another reason so many European leaders from the mainstream parties of the center right and center left, from Angela Merkel of Germany to David Cameron of Britain and Mariano Rajoy of Spain, came to show their own solidarity with France and Mr. Hollande.Invitees also included the leaders of all the main French political parties, including former prime ministers and presidents, like Nicolas Sarkozy and his rivals on the center right in the Union for a Popular Movement, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who themselves are divided but also battling for voters attracted to National Front.Ms. Le Pen was excluded from the Paris rally, however, in what many consider a political mistake by Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party, which organized the event.Ms. Le Pen, whose support in various opinion polls for the 2017 presidential election comes close to 30 percent, loudly cried foul. Her exclusion made a mockery of the concept of national unity, she said, and was itself a violation of \u201cfreedom of expression,\u201d which the rally was meant to uphold. She accused the political elite of \u201castounding cowardice\u201d to isolate \u201cthe only political movement that has no responsibility in the current situation, nor do its millions of voters.\u201d\u201cThe masks fall,\u201d she said. \u201cNational unity is a pitiful political maneuver.\u201dShe said her supporters would see her exclusion as a \u201ctribute\u201d to their power, saying, \u201cThey will have the opportunity if they wish to express their opinion at the ballot box.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s embrace of exclusion perfectly fits her politics. Using old tropes of the far right in France, she took pride in avoiding the capital, Paris, which she and her supporters view as the center of political corruption and cynicism, for \u201cla France profonde,\u201d the \u201creal France\u201d of genuine patriots tied to their land and their provinces. So she marched on Sunday instead in southern France, in Beaucaire, where her party won local elections.\u201cWe\u2019ll march there where the spirit of tolerance is the strongest,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere sectarianism is less violent.\u201dAlain Barluet, a journalist with the daily Le Figaro, said Mr. Hollande had handled the situation well except for his exclusion of Ms. Le Pen.\u201cThe problem for us now is simple: Will she be the next president?\u201d Mr. Barluet said. \u201cMany people are unhappy with the exclusion of the National Front from the march, since she is always emphasizing this fracture \u2014 that she is a victim, that she is the real France.\u201dMr. Hollande will benefit for a time from national mourning and solidarity, Mr. Barluet said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how long this very fragile unity will last,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, next week things will again begin to crumble.\u201dAt the rally, near the Bastille, Nicolas Michaud, 31, said he came to defend \u201cFrench values, freedom of speech and liberty \u2014 France is not a race or a religion.\u201d Mr. Hollande and the police did well, and \u201che assumed his role as president,\u201d Mr. Michaud said. Today is for unity, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a turning point, but divisions will resurface.\u201d As for Ms. Le Pen, he said, \u201cHer bread and butter is division.\u201d10 PhotosVal\u00e9rie Berjolet, 50, who came with her family, said that every politician will try to capitalize on the event. Ms. Le Pen \u201calways profits by playing the role of martyr,\u201d she said. \u201cThe others gave her the opportunity so she could act like this.\u201dWith the Union for a Popular Movement so divided, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult not to see Le Pen doing better,\u201d said Pierre Rousselin, a political analyst and author of a book, \u201cThe Democracies in Danger.\u201dFaced with a challenge from Mr. Sarkozy and the center right, Mr. Hollande is trying to establish himself as the only viable alternative to Ms. Le Pen, he said.\u201cIf Hollande can do that, it will be good for him,\u201d Mr. Rousselin said. \u201cThis is cynical politics, and there\u2019s a lot of this going on beneath the spirit and the beautiful slogan that \u2018we are all Charlie.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe problem, Mr. Rousselin said, is that \u201cthe National Front is the only party that is saying out loud things that many people feel, and the current moment is playing into this discourse.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you had national unity with the National Front present, you could say that we are united and the terrorists are isolated, but the problem is the infighting that starts the day after.\u201dAt the rally, Nasser Khassani, 39, came from the suburbs to wear a placard on his chest reading: \u201cI am a Christian, I am a Jew, I am a Muslim.\u201d He said he came out of \u201cempathy for the victims,\u201d and to \u201cthank the police and the government \u2014 not the Socialist Party, but the Republic,\u201d he said.But Claude Dugenet, 60, was less appreciative. \u201cThis national unity will not last, for sure,\u201d he said. The crisis was handled well once it happened, he said, but it was \u201cdeplorable\u201d not to have acted sooner. \u201cToday we are suffering the consequences.\u201dAssia Labbas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Paradox of the Free-Market Liberal", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterIN American politics, personality is, supposedly, destiny: Having a conservative personality makes us conservative on economic and social policy, and vice versa for liberals. Think of the stereotypes: the free-spending, libertine liberal; the rock-ribbed, free-market conservative. Start by considering the most influential scholarly view of how personality affects political ideology: the \u201crigidity of the right\u201d model. It holds that people differ from one another in terms of whether they are closed-minded and prefer what is familiar, or are open-minded and prefer diverse experiences. According to this view, those with a conservative personality \u2014 which is thought to be implemented by basic neurocognitive and structural brain differences \u2014 are likely to gravitate toward a broad-based conservative ideology, both culturally and economically. A conservative personality, the view posits, makes you favor the stability and continuity of traditional cultural norms, and it makes you favor right-wing economic policy because that sort of policy will not disrupt the prevailing economic hierarchy. But when it came to economic matters related to social welfare policy and economic intervention \u2014 the central feature of the left-right divide in much of the world \u2014 the results were far different. People with a conservative personality tended to lean slightly to the left.According to the political scientist Christopher Johnston of Duke and his colleagues Christopher M. Federico and Howard G. Lavine of the University of Minnesota, a conservative personality might actually pull people in two directions with respect to their economic attitudes. Prioritizing order and stability will lead to a yearning for the security that left-wing economic policies aim to provide \u2014 but having such a conservative personality will also lead to cultural conservatism, which, if a person is politically attentive, might indirectly lead to favoring economically conservative policy as well. Why? Political messaging.Political messages often promote the view that right-wing economic preferences naturally fit with right-wing cultural preferences under a broad \u201cconservative\u201d banner. These messages define what constitutes an ideologically consistent package of preferences, and make people more likely to adopt a consistent ideological bundle. They make you say, \u201cIf I am culturally conservative, I should also be economically conservative.\u201dOur cross-national evidence was consistent with this argument: Over all, having a conservative personality made people lean to the left economically \u2014 with an important exception. Among people who were both highly attentive to politics and from countries in which left-right ideological conflict was prominent, like the United States, having a conservative personality was associated with holding right-wing economic views. What does all of this mean for ideological conflict in the United States? For one thing, we must be cautious about accepting claims that a broad ideological conflict, pitting culturally traditional and free-market conservatives against culturally progressive and redistributive liberals, is a natural consequence of personality differences. There\u2019s nothing natural about it: Such a conflict has more to do with the political messages that Americans receive about the nature of politicians\u2019 ideological conflict. If there is nothing set about the combinations of political views we adopt, then there is nothing to say those combinations of attitudes can\u2019t change. Indeed, decades of research in political science have shown that the dominant packages of political attitudes often do change, as a result of messages from political elites. While such insight will not soften our hostile partisan climate, it might be helpful to keep in mind as we experience the highest levels of political polarization that the nation has seen in decades.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twin Peaks Planet", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that\u2019s a story about developments within nations, and, therefore, incomplete. You really want to supplement Piketty-style analysis with a global view, and when you do, I\u2019d argue, you get a better sense of the good, the bad and the potentially very ugly of the world we live in.And let\u2019s be clear: Income growth in emerging nations has produced huge gains in human welfare, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of desperate poverty and giving them a chance for a better life. Now for the bad news: Between these twin peaks \u2014 the ever-richer global elite and the rising Chinese middle class \u2014 lies what we might call the valley of despond: Incomes have grown slowly, if at all, for people around the 20th percentile of the world income distribution. Who are these people? Basically, the advanced-country working classes. And although Mr. Milanovic\u2019s data only go up through 2008, we can be sure that this group has done even worse since then, wracked by the effects of high unemployment, stagnating wages, and austerity policies.Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.So who speaks for those left behind in this twin-peaked world? You might have expected conventional parties of the left to take a populist stance on behalf of their domestic working classes. But mostly what you get instead \u2014 from leaders ranging from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France to Ed Milliband of Britain to, yes, President Obama \u2014 is awkward mumbling. (Mr. Obama has, in fact, done a lot to help working Americans, but he\u2019s remarkably bad at making his own case.)The problem with these conventional leaders, I\u2019d argue, is that they\u2019re afraid to challenge elite priorities, in particular the obsession with budget deficits, for fear of being considered irresponsible. And that leaves the field open for unconventional leaders \u2014 some of them seriously scary \u2014 who are willing to address the anger and despair of ordinary citizens.All of this suggests some uncomfortable historical analogies. Remember, this is the second time we\u2019ve had a global financial crisis followed by a prolonged worldwide slump. Then, as now, any effective response to the crisis was blocked by elite demands for balanced budgets and stable currencies. And the eventual result was to deliver power into the hands of people who were, shall we say, not very nice.I\u2019m not suggesting that we\u2019re on the verge of fully replaying the 1930s. But I would argue that political and opinion leaders need to face up to the reality that our current global setup isn\u2019t working for everyone. It\u2019s great for the elite and has done a lot of good for emerging nations, but that valley of despond is very real. And bad things will happen if we don\u2019t do something about it.

{"Headline": "Stay-at-Home Parents Already Get a Tax Preference", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncentivesThose parents wouldn\u2019t be able to take the proposed tax credit equal to 50 percent of child care expenses, up to a maximum of $3,000 per child. What the critics fail to see is that the playing field wasn\u2019t level to begin with. The tax code is already hugely distorted in favor of stay-at-home parenting: Labor outside the home is taxed; household work, such as stay-at-home parenting, is not.I realize that sounds like a bizarre thing to say. Why would there be a tax on parenting, and why would the lack of such a tax constitute a tax preference? But productive activities within the home are not especially different from the taxable work we do outside the home. We labor, and instead of receiving a cash wage, we receive something else we value: a clean house or a mowed lawn or a well-behaved child. In 1973, the economist John Kendrick estimated that unmeasured and untaxed household activities like child rearing amounted to about a quarter of the size of the whole economy as measured by gross national product.When we hire people to come into our homes to do these things, the labor is counted as part of the economy and subject to tax. If I pay you to watch my child and you pay me to watch your child, we both owe income tax. If you and I each watch our own children, the I.R.S. collects nothing \u2014 even though we have done substantially the same work for the same benefit. This tax preference for housework over paid work creates a significant distortion: Some people (mostly women) choose to stay home when, absent tax considerations, they might work outside the home instead.To be clear, I\u2019m not proposing that we start taxing household production the way we tax other production. Efforts by the government to measure how productive we are at home would be intrusive and inaccurate, not to mention politically toxic. But we should design policies that account for the distortion that inevitably arises from the impracticality of taxing the home.The best question then is not whether Mr. Obama\u2019s tax credit policy is designed to give preference to parents who choose to work outside the home (it is) but whether that preference is so large that it more than offsets the value of the tax preference stay-at-home parents already enjoy. And the answer to that will vary based on family income, the number of young children in a household, and how many hours a parent spends parenting.Let\u2019s work out the numbers. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, married mothers with young children at home spend 50.7 hours a week on housework, shopping and caring for household members if they are not employed outside the home, compared with 29.4 hours spent on those activities if they are employed full-time outside the home. So, stay-at-home moms do an extra 21 hours a week of unpaid and untaxed labor; at a median full-time wage of just over $37,000 and a marginal tax rate of 20 percent, a typical mother would face about a $4,400 tax penalty for doing that work at an office instead of staying home.Mr. Obama\u2019s plan would offset much of that tax disincentive if she had one young child, and more than offset it if she had two or more. The circumstances would vary: In some cases, the tax code would provide a stronger incentive to stay home than to work outside it, and in others vice versa. But that would replace the current system in which the strong tax incentive is in favor of stay-at-home parenting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Oil Revenue Dropping, Mexico Announces Budget Cuts", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Faced with declining prices for its oil exports, Mexico\u2019s government announced $8.3 billion in budget cuts, slashing the budget of the state oil company. It also effectively canceled a bullet train project at the center of a conflict-of-interest scandal that has weakened Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency.Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said the cuts were aimed at strengthening confidence in public finances at a time when flows to emerging markets are declining. \u201cWe must act preventively today,\u201d Mr. Videgaray said. Concern over falling oil prices has been putting pressure on the peso, which has dipped sharply over the past month.Taxes on the oil company Pemex are the biggest single source of revenue for the government, accounting for about a third of federal spending. The 2015 budget was based on the price of oil at $79 a barrel, and the price of Mexican crude has fallen to just over $40 a barrel now. But at the same time, the biggest share of the cuts announced on Friday, almost half, will fall on Pemex.Among the other savings that Mr. Videgaray announced was the indefinite suspension of a high-speed train that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had hoped to build between Mexico City and the growing industrial hub of Quer\u00e9taro.The $3.7 billion train was intended to be an emblem of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s vigorous economic leadership. But instead it has brought him only embarrassment.The train contract was initially awarded in November to a consortium led by the China Railway Construction Corporation, which was the only bidder after other companies complained that they had not been given enough time to prepare.The contract was quickly canceled, and the government began to prepare a new tender.Days later, a Mexican investigative team reported that one of the minority bidders in the consortium, a company called Grupo Higa, had built a luxury home for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife in Mexico City\u2019s most expensive neighborhood. The first lady, Ang\u00e9lica Rivera, a former television actress, said that she was buying the house with a mortgage from Grupo Higa, but agreed to sell it.Grupo Higa also built a weekend home on an exclusive golf course that it sold to Mr. Videgaray on credit in 2012, shortly before he became finance minister. He paid off the mortgage last year, he told reporters after The Wall Street Journal first reported on the deal.Analysts welcomed the budget cuts, which were larger than many expected. \u201cOn the positive side, this means that the government has a buffer against weaker prices, or a weaker economy,\u201d said Rodrigo Aguilera, Mexico economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit, a company in London that analyzes risk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Much Too Responsible", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States and Europe have a lot in common. Both are multicultural and democratic; both are immensely wealthy; both possess currencies with global reach. Both, unfortunately, experienced giant housing and credit bubbles between 2000 and 2007, and suffered painful slumps when the bubbles burst.Since then, however, policy on the two sides of the Atlantic has diverged. In one great economy, officials have shown a stern commitment to fiscal and monetary virtue, making strenuous efforts to balance budgets while remaining vigilant against inflation. In the other, not so much. Why did they get it so wrong?Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s central bankers decided to worry about inflation in 2011 and raise interest rates. Even at the time it was obvious that this was foolish \u2014 yes, there had been an uptick in headline inflation, but measures of underlying inflation were too low, not too high. Monetary policy got much better after Mario Draghi became president of the European Central Bank in late 2011. Indeed, Mr. Draghi\u2019s heroic efforts to provide liquidity to nations facing speculative attack almost surely saved the euro from collapse. But it\u2019s not at all clear that he has the tools to fight off the broader deflationary forces set in motion by years of wrongheaded policy. Furthermore, he has to function with one hand tied behind his back, because Germany remains adamantly opposed to anything that might make life easier for debtor nations.The terrible thing is that Europe\u2019s economy was wrecked in the name of responsibility. True, there have been times when being tough meant reducing deficits and resisting the temptation to print money. In a depressed economy, however, a balanced-budget fetish and a hard-money obsession are deeply irresponsible. Not only do they hurt the economy in the short run, they can \u2014 and in Europe, have \u2014 inflict long-run harm, damaging the economy\u2019s potential and driving it into a deflationary trap that\u2019s very hard to escape.Nor was this an innocent mistake. The thing that strikes me about Europe\u2019s archons of austerity, its doyens of deflation, is their self-indulgence. They felt comfortable, emotionally and politically, demanding sacrifice (from other people) at a time when the world needed more spending. They were all too eager to ignore the evidence that they were wrong.And Europe will be paying the price for their self-indulgence for years, perhaps decades, to come. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Modest Move on Methane ", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere is much to like in the Obama administration\u2019s proposal, announced last Wednesday, to reduce harmful methane emissions from oil and gas drilling. The proposal \u2014 which calls for detailed rules to be unveiled in early summer \u2014 is the first federal effort to directly regulate methane, the main component of natural gas and a major contributor to climate change. The regulations will apply to all new oil and gas wells, and be national in scope, thus setting minimum standards for what is now a patchwork quilt of state laws. They will make a dent in the billions of cubic feet of gas that now escape unchecked into the atmosphere. But only a dent. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency said their goal was to cut methane emissions by between 40 and 45 percent in the next decade, a laudable ambition. But rules that apply only to new facilities, as these do, won\u2019t do the trick; over the next five years, 90 percent of methane emissions are expected to come from existing oil and gas operations. The agency said it hoped for voluntary measures to modernize existing operations. But if history is any guide, mandatory regulation of some sort will almost certainly be necessary. The natural gas industry in particular has been alarmingly slow to clean up its act despite widespread public concern over the threats to air and water quality presented by the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing. Methane accounts for about 9 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in this country. But its chemical properties make it a more potent trapper of heat than carbon dioxide, by far the main greenhouse gas. Although methane is also produced by agricultural operations and other sources like landfills, the easiest leaks to control are those that occur in the drilling and transmission of natural gas, and, to a lesser extent, oil. These emissions are expected to rise substantially as industry exploits new and old deposits through hydraulic fracturing and as the preferred fuel for power plants gradually shifts from coal to natural gas. President Obama promised to address methane emissions last March as part of his broader climate action plan. Controlling methane is one of the last missing pieces of his climate strategy, which already includes much stronger fuel economy standards for vehicles and proposed rules governing carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. He cannot meet his pledge of reducing America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 without tackling methane. Though inadequate, the new plan is a welcome and necessary step toward that goal.Advertisement"}

The roughly 5 percent that economists believe is consistent with full employment may be only a few months away.There are two dark clouds along with that generally sunny story for American workers.First, while the unemployment rate is falling rapidly, there has been less progress in pulling back in the millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force entirely during the recession and slow recovery.One way of measuring it: The proportion of the population with a job fell nearly five percentage points from late 2007 to late 2010 \u2014 and the economy has regained only one of those five percentage points since. Some of that is because of longer-term demographic changes, particularly with the baby boom generation reaching retirement age. But there are millions who left the labor force when the economy went south and do not yet see the opportunities that might coax them to rejoin the work force.The ClimateHealth CareThe American health care system has arguably changed more in the last year than in any of the last 50. Yet some of its problems remain stubbornly the same.EducationHow are he and the country doing? The bad news is that the country is not pace to meet the goal. Absent a surge in college completion over the next five years, the United States will still trail several other countries.The good news is that the country is making clear progress on educational attainment. (Some other countries are, too, which is partly why the United States is not on pace to get back to No. 1.) Among 30-year-olds, 38.3 percent had a four-year college degree in 2012, up from 35.9 percent in 2009. That pace of increase \u2014 about 0.8 of a percentage point a year \u2014 is faster than the average pace (0.3 of a percentage point) over the previous 30 years.The percentage of people graduating from community college has also increased in recent years. Mr. Obama\u2019s goal is based on both two-year and four-year degrees.One reason for the increase has little to do with government policy: During the financial crisis, people flooded onto college campuses, much as they flooded into high schools during the Great Depression. But government policy can take partial credit: An expansion of federal financial-aid programs, which began before Mr. Obama took office but which he has emphasized, has also played a role.RaceThe Public MoodBy historical standards, the country remains pessimistic about the direction of the country, the economy and President Obama\u2019s performance in office. But there is no question that Americans are far more confident than they were when Mr. Obama took office \u2014 more confident even than a year ago.For the first time since the start of the recession, more Americans believe economic conditions are good or excellent than poor. Consumer confidence has risen to the highest level in 11 years, according to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index.Yet Americans are not satisfied with the direction of the country. Just 32 percent say they\u2019re satisfied with the way things are going in the United States, according to Gallup. But that\u2019s the most optimistic reading since November 2012, when Democrats were perhaps more enthusiastic about the direction of the country than they would have been if Mr. Obama had not just won re-election.RetirementYou might be surprised by the lack of improvement in recent years, since home equity and retirement accounts are two pillars of the typical middle-income household\u2019s retirement plan, and home prices and stock prices have both risen sharply since 2009. But improvement in those areas has been offset by low interest rates (which mean you need more assets to generate a given amount of retirement income) and by cuts to Social Security that were enacted in 1983 but are just gradually taking effect now.One of the biggest risk factors for retirement undersaving is not having an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Sixty-eight percent of households with no such plan are on pace to be undersaved, compared with just 20 percent of those with a traditional pension, and 53 percent of those with a 401(k)-style plan but no traditional pension.Traditional pensions are expensive, and have been in decline at large private employers for decades. But while there is a lost heyday in large-employer retirement benefits, the retirement offerings from small employers have never been very good. While the vast majority of organizations with at least 100 employees offer at least a 401(k) or similar investment plan, just half of smaller employers do.The WorkplaceBut while the policies have not changed, the makeup of America\u2019s workplaces and families has. Today, 71 percent of women with children at home work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women are the sole or primary breadwinner in 40 percent of households with children, according to data from the Pew Research Center.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Prices Fall and Worry Escalates in the Eurozone", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Europe\u2019s economy has reached a psychological inflection point.It is an outcome that economists have been predicting for more than a year and a trend that has long been complicating Europe\u2019s recovery.Now, the latest data is adding concerns that Europe is headed for a new financial and economic crisis. Unemployment remains persistently high. The euro has been particularly weak. And the political upheaval in Greece is prompting talk about the stability of the 19-country euro currency union.With the outlook deteriorating, pressure is mounting for the European Central Bank take more aggressive action to avoid a downward price spiral that could undermine the economy for years to come. Top officials have already been signaling that they could announce a major bond-buying program later this month.But the question raised by many economists is whether the European Central Bank has waited too long to act, and whether its arsenal is powerful enough to address the eurozone\u2019s fundamental problem \u2014 a dearth of demand from businesses and consumers for goods and services. Even the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, has said that it alone cannot shoulder the burden of restarting growth.\u201cThe eurozone is suffering from a profound malaise,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London. \u201cIt\u2019s already in a deflationary trap of the kind we saw in Japan in the 1990s, but it\u2019s less well equipped than the Japanese to deal with it,\u201d he added, citing the institutional challenges of managing a currency bloc of 19 nations.The situation in Europe does not appear to meet the classical definition of deflation, a widespread, protracted and self-sustaining decline in prices. And the continued global collapse of crude oil prices contributed significantly to the decline, blurring somewhat the implications of the inflation report for the 19-country euro currency union.But the trend is dangerous. The low inflation environment was already a signal of a listless economy, with consumers spending little despite low prices and companies having scant incentive to invest in their businesses.If prices actually fall for an extended period, consumers might delay purchase in hopes of getting a better deal later, and businesses would see little reason to make products that would be worth less with each passing month.\"We\u2019re not yet in a self-sustaining spiral,\u201d said Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America in London. \u201cBut we\u2019re close.\u201dThe labor market provides one illustration of what makes Europe\u2019s situation particularly complicated to fix.In Germany, which has the bloc\u2019s biggest economy, unemployment fell to 6.4 percent in December from 6.5 percent in November. But in the second- and third-largest of the eurozone economies, France and Italy, the jobless rates climbed, with Italian unemployment reaching a new high of 13.4 percent.And in Greece and Spain, about a quarter of the population remains without work, a level consistent with economic depression.But quantitative easing is a divisive issue in Europe because of questions about how to allocate the bond buying among eurozone countries, and who would pay if a government defaulted on bonds held by the central bank. That uncertainty is a main reason that Germany does not want to put its taxpayers at risk of having to bail out the bloc\u2019s weaker neighbors.The central bank has an official goal of trying to keep inflation at just below 2 percent, which it considers an optimal level for a healthy economy. But the bank has not met that target in two years.Japan\u2019s experience in the 1990s showed that traditional monetary policy instruments are largely ineffective with nominal interest rates at zero, as they essentially are now in the eurozone.Another way to address the problem might be for eurozone countries to drop their insistence on balancing budgets and to instead use tax cuts and public spending to create demand.So far, though, European officials appear to be holding their course.\u201cYes, the eurozone is going through a period of low inflation,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance officials, said in a statement in response to a New York Times query. \u201cBut one of the most important reasons for the current low inflation rate is the falling oil price. Core inflation \u2014 excluding oil prices \u2014 has recently slightly increased.\u201dThe core inflation rate, which excludes energy and food prices, ticked up to 0.8 percent in December from 0.7 percent the month before, according to Wednesday\u2019s data.The German government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has taken a tough line against coordinated economic stimulus, indicated that the latest data had not altered its thinking. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said in Berlin on Wednesday that Germany would not revise its analysis that there was no risk of deflation in the country. That statement came despite a report on Monday showing that German consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month.J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, on Wednesday defended the German view, saying that the danger was being overstated in light of the debt overload that was behind the global and European financial crisis that developed in 2008.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable after the bursting of a debt bubble that inflation is low, as consumers and business repay their debts and spend only hesitantly,\u201d he said.Some of the weakness in prices reflects lower labor costs in the weaker \u201cperipheral\u201d eurozone members, he said, something that can make their economies more competitive. \u201cWe do not have harmful deflation,\u201d he said.There is no question, though, that the eurozone is ailing. The bloc\u2019s economy expanded 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014 on an annualized basis. That is far short of the United States economy\u2019s 5.0 percent growth, and recent data suggest that the eurozone pace has been slowing.That stark difference is one reason the value of the euro currency has been plunging compared to the dollar in recent weeks. It fell again on Wednesday after the inflation report, declining more than 0.5 percent to $1.1816 \u2014 its lowest level in nine years. As was the case the last time the euro was this low, fund managers are moving investments to the United States in expectations of a better return on their money.Consumer prices in the eurozone had not contracted on an annual basis since October 2009, when the slack global economy made the bottom fall out of the market for oil and other commodities. December\u2019s negative rate was down from the 0.3 percent increase in November.Well before eurozone consumer prices tipped below zero, the region\u2019s low inflation rate had been raising alarms.Mr. Draghi, the central bank president, said last week in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the risk of deflation \u201ccannot be ruled out completely, but it is limited.\u201d\u201cWe are not there yet,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cBut we need to tackle this risk.\u201dInvestors have been snapping up government bonds of eurozone countries amid expectations that a European Central Bank purchasing program would make them more valuable. Yields on German, French and Belgian bonds have all hit record lows this week.Ireland on Wednesday was able to issue seven-year bonds at a yield of 0.867 percent, an astonishingly low rate for a country that was bailed out by the I.M.F. and the European Union in 2010.Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, wrote in a note on Wednesday that the contraction in consumer prices \u201cis a severe blow to the credibility\u201d of the European Central Bank.\u201cThe E.C.B.\u2019s hand has been forced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything less than a firm pledge by its president, Mario Draghi, that sovereign quantitative easing is imminent will be taken very badly by markets.\"Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece Chooses Anti-Austerity Party in Major Shift", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAppearing before a throng of supporters outside Athens University late Sunday, Mr. Tsipras, 40, declared that the era of austerity was over and promised to revive the economy. He also said his government would not allow Greece\u2019s creditors to strangle the country.\u201cGreece will now move ahead with hope and reach out to Europe, and Europe is going to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe verdict is clear: We will bring an end to the vicious circle of austerity.\u201dSyriza\u2019s victory is a milestone for Europe. Continuing economic weakness has stirred a populist backlash from France to Spain to Italy, with more voters growing fed up with policies that require sacrifice to meet the demands of creditors but that have not delivered more jobs and prosperity. Syriza is poised to become the first anti-austerity party to take power in a eurozone country and to shatter the two-party establishment that has dominated Greek politics for four decades.\u201cDemocracy will return to Greece,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said to a swarm of journalists as he cast his ballot in Athens. \u201cThe message is that our common future in Europe is not the future of austerity.\u201dBut his biggest promise \u2014 and the one that has stirred deep anxiety in Brussels and Berlin as well as in financial markets \u2014 has been a pledge to force Greece\u2019s creditors to renegotiate the terms of its financial bailout, worth 240 billion euros, or about $267.5 billion. Squeezed by policies intended to stabilize the government\u2019s finances, Greece has endured a historic collapse since 2009; economic output has shrunk by 25 percent, and the unemployment rate hovers near 26 percent.While setting up an imminent showdown with creditors, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Tsipras has argued that easing the bailout terms would allow more government spending. That, he said, would stimulate economic growth and employment as well as help the Greeks who are most in need.\u201cTsipras won because those who imposed austerity never thought about the effects of such drastic policies that impoverished millions of people,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, a professor at the London School of Economics and a former adviser to the European Commission. \u201cIn a world where people are so hit, they just don\u2019t remain passive. Their reaction is to turn to the politicians who will change the process.\u201dMr. Tsipras will face immediate challenges. Greece is waiting for a \u20ac7 billion bailout payment needed to keep the government running and to pay off billions in debt obligations due in the coming months. Mr. Tsipras has demanded that creditors write down at least half of Greece\u2019s \u20ac319 billion public debt to give the country more breathing room for a spending stimulus. \u201cThis is a turning of a page, a historical moment for all of Europe,\u201d Yiannis Milios, the chief economist for Syriza, told reporters. \u201cThe Greek people are taking their future into their own hands.\u201dEurope \u201ccannot go on with deflation, recession, increasing unemployment and over-indebtednesses,\u201d he said. \u201cGreece points the way. Our country, our people, are the groundbreakers of a very big change.\u201dA Syriza victory would lift hopes elsewhere for parties that are critical of the European Union, especially in Spain. There, the left-leaning, anti-austerity Podemos party, which is less than a year old, already is drawing 20 percent support in national opinion polls. The leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, joined Mr. Tsipras last week for Syriza\u2019s final campaign rally.\u201cWhat the whole debate about Greece and Syriza highlights is that voter anxieties, voter resentment and electoral disillusionment over austerity policies can be expressed at the ballot,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economic consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cThe example of Greece today may become a precursor to what happens in other countries like Spain, Portugal or Italy.\u201dMr. Tsipras has said he wants to negotiate directly with Ms. Merkel and other European leaders to reduce Greece\u2019s debt burden. Some officials, however, have characterized Mr. Tsipras\u2019s demands as unrealistic and rife with potential to drive Greece toward default \u2014 or even out of the eurozone, the group that shares the currency.Earlier concerns that a Syriza-led Greece would abandon the euro have been fading, but Mr. Tsipras\u2019s confrontational stance on renegotiating the bailout could create a game of chicken with Greece\u2019s creditors. Mr. Tsipras has insisted that he will not adhere to the bailout\u2019s austerity conditions; Greece\u2019s creditors insist that they will not disburse funds unless he does.Mr. Tsipras has pledged immediate action, including restoring electricity to poor families who were unable to pay their bills. He has promised to raise the minimum monthly wage to \u20ac751 from \u20ac586 for all workers, restore collective bargaining agreements, prohibit mass layoffs and create 300,000 jobs.Jens Weidmann, president of Deutsche Bundesbank, the German central bank, warned that Greece would remain dependent on outside financial support and that the new government \u201cshould not make promises that the country cannot afford.\u201d\u201cI hope the new government won\u2019t call into question what is expected and what has already been achieved,\u201d Mr. Weidmann said in an interview with Germany\u2019s public broadcaster.On the streets of Athens, voters expressed a range of emotions as they went to the polls. At a polling station in Mets, a middle-class district near central Athens, Achilleas Mandrakis, 47, said he runs a garage but has been struggling since his wife lost her job at a shoe store. \u201cI always voted New Democracy, and I never trusted the leftists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut enough is enough, really. We kept giving them a chance, but they messed up. They\u2019ve made our lives miserable.\u201d \u201cAt least,\u201d Mr. Mandrakis added, \u201ca different party might change something in this mess, anything.\u201dIn a brief news conference late Sunday, Mr. Samaras vowed that his party would continue to play a role in Greek politics and defended his government. \u201cI received the country at the edge of a cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cI was asked to take burning coals into my hands, and I did it.\u201dMr. Samaras said that Greece had moved away from deficits and recession and that his government had \u201crestored the credibility of the country.\u201dFor Syriza, the immediate question was whether the party would win the 151 seats needed for a majority in Parliament. Projections suggested a close final result. If he falls short, Mr. Tsipras might align with the Independent Greeks, a center-right fringe party that opposes austerity measures and might push for a harder line in any debt negotiations. Early returns also showed the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party in third place with roughly 6 percent of the total vote, even with some of its leaders campaigning from prison, awaiting trial on charges of being in a criminal gang.Many analysts say Mr. Tsipras must moderate his campaign promises and take a more centrist approach if he wants to save the economy and keep Greece solvent. \u201cThat will be the best possible outcome for Greece and for Europe, because it would show that these protest movements ultimately recognize reality \u2014 which is that they are in the euro, and they have to play by the rules,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Otherwise, he warned, \u201cthings could get a lot worse.\u201d\u201cVery, very quickly,\u201d he added.Dimitris Bounias and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Spending, Edging Up, Is a Stimulus ", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAPLES, Fla. \u2014 For a long stretch, government spending cutbacks at all levels were a substantial drag on economic growth. Now, finally, relief is in sight.For the first time since 2011, local, state and federal governments are providing a small but significant increase to prosperity.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of positive contribution coming from the government sector, but when you\u2019re talking about economic growth, less of a negative is a positive,\u201d said Chris Varvares, senior managing director and co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers.And so on a recent windswept afternoon, John Lynch, armed with a police radio and a giant net, stood along a fishing pier in Naples, on guard for pelicans that might become entangled in fishing lines.\u201cThat\u2019s my job, to try and get them to safety,\u201d said Mr. Lynch, a retired banker with a snowy beard whose uniform was a fisherman\u2019s cap and shorts.Mr. Lynch is one of the latest additions to the city\u2019s payroll. His is the kind of government job this Gulf Coast town never would have even contemplated during the recession.\u201cWhen everybody else is cutting back, you don\u2019t hire people,\u201d said Ann Marie S. Ricardi, the finance director for the city of Naples, about 130 miles south of Tampa.Across the nation, state and local governments, Democratic and Republican alike, are spending on projects that were stalled. Teachers, who were laid off in droves in recent years, are being hired again. Even federal spending in some sectors is on the rise.But no one is making plans for spending sprees, said Donald J. Boyd, senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. Many officials were spooked by the most serious economic downturn since the 1930s, he said, and these are still tough times for many states and localities.\u201cIt\u2019s just in comparison to what they were, they\u2019re great,\u201d Mr. Boyd said.Since the stimulus programs approved in 2008 and 2009, Republicans in Washington have pushed to cut federal spending; even the $1.1 trillion budget bill that Congress recently passed to keep the government operating through September abides by spending caps and includes further trims.But there is less of a political drive to slash spending as the federal deficit has declined sharply, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The Congressional Budget Office now projects an annual deficit of 3 percent of total economic activity or less through the end of the decade, well under its post-World War II average. And with interest rates at rock-bottom, the Treasury\u2019s cost of borrowing is barely 1.3 percent of gross national product, an unusually low level that imposes little burden on taxpayers.\u201cThis new revenue, the increase in the economy, the increase in G.D.P. \u2014 everything is looking good,\u201d Mr. Haskins said. \u201cIt\u2019s releasing pressure to be fiscally restrained.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the real momentum will be, longer term,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.On the state level, signs of budget gaps and midyear budget cuts that were typical during the recession have diminished. Still, state revenue is creeping up, not booming, which translates to only incremental improvement.More people are working in schools now than a year ago, for example, but there are still nearly 300,000 fewer than before the recession, said Michael Heenan, a spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers.\u201cThere has been some belt-tightening that looks like it\u2019s not going to be loosened again,\u201d said Tara M. Sinclair, an associate economics professor at George Washington University and economist for the online job site Indeed. \u201cPeople may be breathing a little easier. But there\u2019s not tons of money sloshing around even for minor expenses.\u201dThe recovery has been uneven for governments across the country. Some states are being left behind altogether. Alaska, for one, has been stung by the plummeting cost of oil after projecting that it would be much higher. Other oil-rich states, like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, are bracing for cutbacks.By contrast, California has wound up with more revenue than expected, a turnaround from a few years ago, prompting talk of more financing for education, including community colleges.Yet even in California, the celebrations of the end of hard times are restrained.\u201cI caution that we\u2019ve been through a difficult downturn here,\u201d said Michael Coleman, fiscal policy adviser to the League of California Cities. \u201cReserves have been spent down, so we\u2019re skating on thin ice.\u201dFlorida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, signed a $77 billion budget this summer that offers tax cuts while providing more money for education, museums, sewer projects and a bicycle trail. In a statement after signing the budget, Governor Scott referred to the economic wringer the state went through after the housing bubble burst and Florida\u2019s unemployment rate rose to more than 11 percent. The governor argued that the new budget \u201cwill keep the great Florida turnaround story going.\u201dFor the city of Naples, it was clear the squeeze was over: For the first time since the recession, it had a budget surplus.That was one reason the city, after a long lobbying campaign from a conservation organization, finally agreed to dedicate $10,000 for two part-time workers to help trapped pelicans, birds whose constant presence hovering over the shore makes them practically town mascots. At least three times in the last year, concerned residents called firefighters to rescue some of the birds who were dangling from the bushy branches of Australian pines, tangled in fishing line discarded at the pier.The Naples Pier outreach assistant job was a minor item in the $32.9 million budget, but an important symbol that times were flush again.During the hard years, Naples, with a population of 20,000 year-round residents and an extra 15,000 during the balmy winter season, used its stash of reserves to balance its budget. A wealthy town with a tax base of beachside mansions and tourist dollars, Naples was cushioned from the body blows the recession dealt nearby communities like Cape Coral and other cities plagued with foreclosures.But even in Naples, the recession stung. Commercial development in the town halted. Property values dropped as much as 18.5 percent.Naples canceled its annual Easter egg hunt and haunted house. The city laid off maintenance workers and let job openings go unfilled, shaving 60 spots from the city payroll of about 500.Now, a 220-unit condominium complex is underway at the site of a former newspaper building. Single-family homes expected to bring as much as $2 million each are being built alongside the Gordon River. The city is pitching in about $5 million for a new mangrove-lined park, but spending will continue to be tight, according to Ms. Ricardi, the budget director.\u201cNobody wants to forget where we were and what happened,\u201d she said.Still, there is more breathing room. The Naples Fire-Rescue Department just bought two new emergency vehicles worth $196,000 each. One of the boxy red trucks arrived last month, just in time to be steered gingerly down the route of the city\u2019s annual Christmas parade, where palm trees were adorned in white holiday lights and children darted for candy tossed from holiday-themed floats.It is an event so precious to locals that the city kept it going during the downturn, said John F. Sorey III, mayor of Naples.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to preserve the wow factor,\u201d he said, \u201cor all our tourists could go somewhere else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By late afternoon, a shaky cease-fire had taken hold, and the president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, appeared to have kept his post. But how much power he had retained was unclear.The authority of Mr. Hadi, an ally of the United States and regional Arab monarchies, has eroded since September, when the Houthis, a former rebel group, seized control of much of the capital.

Its economy is in ruins and humanitarian emergencies, including a high rate of child malnutrition, are straining the ability of government workers and international organizations to respond.Sunni extremists belonging to the powerful local Qaeda affiliate appear to be surging in strength. The extremists \u2014 who recently claimed responsibility for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris \u2014 have carried out a string of deadly bombings in Yemen, framing the attacks as retaliation against the Houthis, whom they regard as heretics from Yemen\u2019s minority Zaydi Shiite sect.Leaders of a southern separatist movement, alarmed at the growing chaos in northern Yemen, have also intensified calls for an independent state.The chaos has worried the Obama administration. American officials had touted a transitional political process in Yemen as a regional model after the fall of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the longtime strongman.And for years, the United States has relied on Yemen\u2019s government to facilitate the American counterterrorism strategy, including missile strikes by drones on Al Qaeda militants that have been deeply unpopular in Yemen. The Houthis, who have framed their regional outlook as in line with Iran\u2019s, have vowed to challenge American influence.British officials posted similar sentiments, as the clashes widened.By Monday evening, Houthi fighters were surrounding the prime minister\u2019s residence, according to Nadia Sakkaf, Yemen\u2019s information minister, who provided a Twitter chronicle of the unfolding violence. \u201cSituation could escalate dangerously,\u201d she wrote at about 9 p.m., suggesting the cease-fire was in peril.The Houthis and government security officials blamed each other for starting the fighting. Houthi leaders said that members of Mr. Hadi\u2019s presidential guard had attacked and wounded two Houthi fighters.Government military officers accused the Houthis of an attempted coup. Tensions had been building for days; over the weekend, Houthi fighters abducted Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, a top aide to Mr. Hadi, apparently hoping to use him as leverage in troubled negotiations over a draft constitution.As the fighting intensified on Monday, there was no public statement from Mr. Hadi, who appeared to have lost control of state news outlets, as events around him spiraled out of control. She reported on cease-fire negotiations as well as an apparent attempts by gunmen to kill the negotiators, including the prime minister. After the cease-fire took hold, Ms. Sakkaf reported that life around the city was \u201calmost normal,\u201d adding a significant caveat: \u201cexcept near Pres house & palace.\u201dThe dead included four civilians, three Houthi fighters and two members of the presidential guard, Ms. Sakkaf said, and more than two dozen were wounded by stray bullets.Shuaib Almosawa reported from Sana, and Kareem Fahim from Baghdad.Advertisement"}

Based on the conditions and their experience, they had planned to avoid the steeper, more dangerous section of the slope. Then, things changed.After skiing another section of the slope four times, they slowly moved into more dangerous terrain. Skiing so close to potential danger without any issues gave them a false sense of security. I\u2019ve been in this position before, too.You tell yourself a story. Everything has been fine so far. Things must be safe. These long periods of safety sow the seeds of future failure as risk creeps in incrementally. It\u2019s so subtle we rarely notice it.Afterward, the skier who got caught said, \u201cI made a number of mistakes and ignored some obvious red flags that all should have been clear signs to back off. I\u2019m just glad all ended well enough, and I had a great group of partners to dig me out.\u201dIt\u2019s fascinating how often we look back on mistakes and see all the obvious warning signs. They\u2019re so obvious we openly admit how dumb we were to miss them. The cause seems to be associated with something I\u2019ll call risk creep.We start with a plan that offers a clear margin of safety. Then, slowly, we allow ourselves to take just a bit more risk. Of course, we don\u2019t call it that. Most of the time we don\u2019t even recognize we\u2019re doing it. As things go well, our perception of risk goes down. We start to feel safe and as a result we take one small step into territory that we previously labeled out of bounds.The process repeats. Take a small risk. Things go well. Increase risk. Repeat until failure.A new year is a great time to examine our financial lives for signs of risk creep.Start with expenses. The normal response to getting a raise, for example, is to let expenses grow to meet the new income.

What risk?\u201d It\u2019s really just like a C.D. earning 10 percent, right? It happens so slowly for many of us that we don\u2019t realize we\u2019ve allocated more to stocks than we promised ourselves we ever would coming out of the terror of 2008 and early 2009.Now it\u2019s time to look at our debt. As the economy rolls along, we start to feel more comfortable with debt. We tell ourselves that we can always pay it off \u2014 eventually. It\u2019s particularly dangerous with mortgage debt. Real estate values do not always go up, in case we\u2019ve already forgotten.The remedy for risk creep happens to be what some would argue is the most important word in the English language: remember. Just remember what it was like to watch a retirement account go down by 50 percent (or more) in 2008. Or what it was like to miss a mortgage payment. Then we need to take a close look at where we are in terms of risk creep and remember: things change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Trade Chief Calls for More Study on Proposed Pact With U.S.", "Date": "2015-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top trade official said on Tuesday that the bloc should continue studying a controversial provision in a proposed trade agreement with the United States, but stopped short of endorsing the measure.At issue is a so-called investment guarantee, which would give companies the right to sue national governments to enforce the terms of any eventual trade deal. While American businesses and the United States government are pressing to include that provision, many Europeans oppose it. The measure has become one of the main sticking points in negotiations over the proposed trade pact, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.A review of more than 150,000 public comments on the matter \u201cclearly shows that there is a huge skepticism\u201d toward the investment guarantee provision, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union\u2019s trade commissioner, said in a statement on Tuesday.The trade pact itself is no sure bet, as negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic have shown little progress after more than a year of periodic talks. For European opponents of the investment guarantee provision, the concern is that if it became part of a trade agreement, it would give companies a legal opening to erode European standards in environmental protection, food quality and labor rights.The issue has become the rallying point for groups that mistrust the European Union, which they see as being unable to control migration and trim unemployment in the bloc, and are suspicious of the United States, which is widely regarded as mismanaging its global power and clumsily imposing electronic surveillance that threatens the privacy of European citizens.Powerful figures like Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister, have called that clause unnecessary, and Matthias Fekl, the French junior minister for trade, has said that including it would make any deal unacceptable to Europe.But many American and European trade experts say the guarantee should be part of any modern trade agreement between the European Union and the United States, which have the two largest economies in the world. Such proponents note that recently agreed-upon European accords with Canada and Singapore contain the guarantee, although those pacts still await ratification by European lawmakers.The proposed trade pact has been under formal negotiation since early 2013, when it was announced by President Obama in his annual State of the Union address. It was initially welcomed by European Union leaders as a debt-free way to spur economic growth in a region plagued by a long debt crisis and high unemployment.The next round of talks is scheduled in Brussels during the first week of February. But talks on the investment guarantee will remain suspended until the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive branch, can try to hash out a possible compromise. Officials said on Tuesday that they had no firm timetable for taking that step.The call for comments on the investment guarantee was conducted by the European Commission from March through July, and generated 150,000 responses. European Union officials said that was probably a record for such an exercise, although it indicated there might have been considerable lobbying by advocacy groups, as about 145,000 of those responses were submitted through online platforms using \u201cpredefined, negative answers.\u201dThe comments \u2014 officially known as a public consultation \u2014 showed trade unions and other campaign groups seeking more assurances that governments could regulate in the public interest, and seeking obligations on businesses to abide by standards on human rights, the environment and corporate social responsibility, according to the commission.But \u201cexcluding investment protection from the T.T.I.P. negotiations is simply not an option,\u201d said Lourdes Catrain, a partner in Brussels with the law firm Hogan Lovells, using the trade proposal\u2019s acronym.\u201cThe United States is the E.U.\u2019s largest trading partner, and it clearly wants investment protection,\" said Ms. Catrain, whose firm advised companies participating in the public consultation. \u201cLeaving it out of that deal would weaken Europe\u2019s negotiating position with China and other parts of the world where European companies are seeking similar investment protections.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Beijing is also aware that India\u2019s problems with the United States, based in large part on Washington\u2019s relationship with India\u2019s archenemy, Pakistan, have diminished, analysts said.But China appears to be banking on India\u2019s long-held position that it will not sign up as a permanent ally of anyone, including the United States.Moreover, China has seemed eager not to be too negative about the Obama visit so as not to damage the progress made during Mr. Xi\u2019s three days in India. Beijing sees big opportunities in Indian infrastructure and technology projects as Mr. Modi tries to kick-start the economy.\u201cWe know India does not want to be part of a containment policy against China,\u201d said Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. \u201cWe believe that the zero-sum game belongs to the last century.\u201dStill, China has paid close attention to the active foreign policy of Mr. Modi, who since assuming office has cultivated not only the United States but also Japan, China\u2019s main rival in East Asia.Mr. Xi promised $20 billion in investments in India over the next five years, something of a letdown in New Delhi. Word before his visit had put the investment at $100 billion. In contrast, Mr. Abe had already pledged $32 billion to help improve India\u2019s weak infrastructure.Mr. Modi enjoys a close personal bond with Mr. Abe, and it was at Mr. Modi\u2019s suggestion that Japan was invited last year to join naval exercises with the United States and India. Beijing was displeased.Mr. Modi did not stop there: During his talks with Mr. Obama, he suggested revitalizing a loose security network involving the United States, India, Japan and Australia, a grouping that China views with suspicion.Mr. Obama persuaded Mr. Modi to sign a statement that implicitly criticized China for its provocative moves in the South China Sea. India had already expressed concerns about China\u2019s behavior in that arm of the western Pacific and is cooperating with Vietnam, another critic of China, on an oil-drilling venture in the area\u2019s waters.\u201cChina feels unhappy but not surprised\u201d about India\u2019s siding with the United States on the South China Sea, said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cWill that have any impact on China\u2019s maritime policies? No. What India can do is not substantive in the regional situation.\u201dChina also expressed concerns this week about Mr. Obama\u2019s offer to support India\u2019s membership in the 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group, an organization devised to ensure that civilian nuclear trade is not diverted for military uses.India\u2019s possible membership was part of a deal between Washington and New Delhi that broke a five-year logjam preventing American companies from building nuclear power plants in India.\u201cWe support the group carrying out discussions on admitting new members, and at the same time we encourage India to take the next steps to satisfy the relevant standards of the group,\u201d Ms. Hua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said of India\u2019s proposed membership.For China, the biggest long-term worry about the developing relationship between New Delhi and Washington may be the advanced military technology that the United States will probably sell to India, said Mr. Wu of the Center for American Studies.\u201cThat will touch China\u2019s security nerve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more advanced Indian capability will increase the pressure on China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wider Chaos Threatens as Fighters Seize Branch of Libya\u2019s Central Bank ", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAYDA, Libya \u2014 The battle for control of Libya threatened to break open its central bank on Thursday as fighters with one of the country\u2019s two warring factions seized control of its Benghazi branch, risking an armed scramble for its gold reserves that could cripple the last functioning institution in the country.The Central Bank of Libya is the great prize at the center of the escalating armed conflicts that have consumed the country since the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi more than three years ago. It has also been the main shield preventing Libya\u2019s descent into utter chaos and deprivation.The central bank is the repository for Libya\u2019s oil revenue and holds nearly $100 billion in foreign reserves. A desire for a share of that wealth has helped motivate the violent competition among an array of militias fighting for money and influence. They have carved the country into warring fiefs, destroyed its two largest airports, bombed and shelled civilian neighborhoods and burned down refineries and oil depots \u2014 driving the oil output that is the mainstay of Libya\u2019s economy down to less than 250,000 barrels a day from as much as 1.7 million a day at its peak.As a result, Libyans across the country endure electricity blackouts for hours a day, long lines for scarce fuel at gas stations, and shortages of cooking oil despite its vast energy resources.But the central bank has sought to remain neutral and above the fray. It has continued to pay for fuel and food subsidies as well as the salaries of bureaucrats, doctors, teachers, local officials and millions of other public employees \u2014 often regardless of whether they showed up for work.By financing the budgets of the Interior and Defense Ministries, the same bank has even provided salaries and supplies for thousands of fighters battling one another from all sides of the struggle. But its continued distribution of paychecks and subsidies has helped communities and families across the country stay afloat despite the collapse of most other economic activity, even maintaining a semblance of order.The bank\u2019s neutrality, though, came under increasing strain as the warring factions established rival national governments, one based in Tripoli in the west and the other in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda. The central bank has two facilities, a headquarters in Tripoli and an eastern branch in Benghazi.Its most direct challenge has come from the Tobruk-Bayda government. It includes a recently elected Parliament, but it is under the de facto control of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who defected from Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s military and last year announced a military takeover pledging to rid the country of violent extremists.The Tobruk-Bayda government has sought since October to replace the central bank\u2019s chairman, Sadik el-Kaber, a veteran banker, in order to take control of the bank\u2019s assets. But Mr. Kaber has refused to resign. He has kept the bank\u2019s headquarters in Tripoli, the nominal capital, which is controlled by a rival coalition of moderate Islamists, extremists and militias from the coastal city of Misurata.Mr. Kaber has pleaded with both sides to respect the bank\u2019s neutrality and keep it above politics, to safeguard Libya\u2019s wealth. Those arguments appear to have won important support among Western nations, which have a critical voice in the bank\u2019s future because much of the bank\u2019s foreign reserves are held in Western financial centers.Mr. Kaber flew to Washington last month for meetings with American and British diplomats, as well as with officials from the White House and the State and Treasury Departments, signaling that the West continued to regard him as the person in charge despite the Tobruk-Bayda government\u2019s efforts to replace him. Its candidate to replace Mr. Kaber \u2014 regarded by his backers as the legitimate central bank chairman \u2014 visited Washington this month but was not accorded the same status, officials here say.The nature of the challenge changed late Wednesday night, when some of General Hifter\u2019s fighters invaded the bank\u2019s building in Benghazi, near the front lines of a continuing fight with local Islamist militants.By Thursday morning, the fighters had posted video online that showed them in control of the premises but refraining, so far, from breaking into the vaults.\u201cWe are the youth of the naval base, and we are here to guard the bank,\u201d a fighter in a camouflage uniform is heard to say in a video, as he leads the camera on a tour of the bank and its flooded basement. Gunfire is audible in the background, apparently coming from the streets outside.Pointing proudly to a parked white Toyota Camry and a closed safe numbered 835, the fighter in the video says, \u201cThere is more inside, but we don\u2019t want to enter, so they don\u2019t call us thieves.\u201dSome leaders on each side of the conflict in Libya agreed to a conditional United Nations-brokered cease-fire last Friday in Geneva, but the fighting has gone on. The Tripoli faction said Thursday that it would no longer take part in the talks.\u201cThere has been an escalation of fighting in the past two days by troops of the wanted Khalifa Hifter,\u201d the Tripoli government said in a statement. \u201cThis escalation peaked today with the storming of a sovereign institution, the central bank in Benghazi.\u201dMohamed Hejazi, a spokesman for General Hifter\u2019s forces, confirmed Thursday that they had taken control of the bank, and said they had also seized \u201c80 percent\u201d of Benghazi\u2019s seaport.Referring to the general\u2019s forces as \u201cthe national army of Libya,\u201d Mr. Hejazi called its opponents \u201cterrorists.\u201d \u201cIt is our duty to secure the central bank until we rid the city of those terrorists,\u201d he said, adding that the Tobruk-Bayda government no longer considered Mr. Kaber the bank\u2019s legitimate chairman.Col. Farraj al-Barasi, a commander of General Hifter\u2019s forces in Benghazi, told Reuters that the forces were forming a committee to decide what to do with the bank\u2019s money. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved out the technical equipment,\u201d he told the news agency. \u201cThe cash is still in the safes.\u201dThe seizure of the Benghazi branch raised immediate fears that militias in Tripoli might seek to seize the bank\u2019s assets there.In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya condemned \u201cthe reported armed attack against the Central Bank branch in Benghazi\u201d and called for \u201can independent commission of inquiry\u201d to help clarify the circumstances.Officials in Washington said in recent days that they met with Mr. Kaber because they were focused on protecting the bank.\u201cWe want very much to bring the conflict to a close, and to do everything we can to help the Libyans preserve the patrimony of the Libyan bank and the Libyan people,\u201d said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomacy. \u201cWe want their money to be intact after the conflict, so that they can rebuild their country.\u201dNews of the seizure in Benghazi prompted a fall in the value of the Libyan currency, which traded at 2 dinars to the dollar, compared with 1.8 before.The conflict in Libya had already posed a serious threat to the country\u2019s assets. In a statement last week, the central bank warned that Libya had brought in only 21 billion dinars in revenue last year, almost all of it from oil sales \u2014 a figure far short of the country\u2019s projected budget of 57 billion dinars, most of it for public subsidies and wages.The bank said the government would have to cut budgets for diplomatic missions and scholarships for Libyans studying abroad, with further austerity measures to come. The Tobruk-Bayda government has taken out large loans from commercial banks to finance its operations.In a statement on Thursday, the central bank condemned the seizure of the Benghazi branch as \u201ca heinous crime\u201d and warned of \u201cdangerous consequences that it could bring at home and abroad.\u201dThe bank called the attack \u201ca dangerous escalation that endangers the fortunes and livelihood of the Libyan people and threatens to bring down the last defense of the Libyan state.\u201d\u201cThe bank had worked very hard to stay away from any political disagreements and to remain an institution for all Libyans and all of Libya,\u201d the statement continued, and it urged all sides \u201cto go to the dialogue table to negotiate, because that is the only way to steer Libya to safe shores.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Sadik el-Kaber\u2019s trip to Washington. It took place last month, not this month.An article on Friday about the seizure of the Benghazi branch of the Central Bank of Libya, the repository for Libya\u2019s oil revenue, by one of the country\u2019s two warring factions misstated Libya\u2019s daily oil output. It is less than 250,000 barrels a day, not less than 250 a day.Suliman Ali Zway contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Life Better in America\u2019s Red States?", "Date": "2015-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHE new Congress that starts work this week is the latest reminder of America\u2019s stark political divisions: The parties in Washington are more polarized than they have been in decades, the partisanship gap between rural Republicans and urban Democrats has grown, and the battle for suburban voters keeps intensifying. Much less is said, however, about the equally significant economic division between conservative \u201cred states\u201d and liberal \u201cblue states.\u201d Blue states, like California, New York and Illinois, whose economies turn on finance, trade and knowledge, are generally richer than red states. But red states, like Texas, Georgia and Utah, have done a better job over all of offering a higher standard of living relative to housing costs. That basic economic fact not only helps explain why the nation\u2019s electoral map got so much redder in the November midterm elections, but also why America\u2019s prosperity is in jeopardy.Red state economies based on energy extraction, agriculture and suburban sprawl may have lower wages, higher poverty rates and lower levels of education on average than those of blue states \u2014 but their residents also benefit from much lower costs of living. For a middle-class person , the American dream of a big house with a backyard and a couple of cars is much more achievable in low-tax Arizona than in deep-blue Massachusetts. As Jed Kolko, chief economist of Trulia, recently noted, housing costs almost twice as much in deep-blue markets ($227 per square foot) than in red markets ($119).Driven by oil, the fracking boom and exurban sprawl, many of the red state economies are experiencing a vigorous (if ultimately unsustainable) spurt of growth. Thanks to loose land-use regulations and low labor costs, detached, single-family homes can be churned out quite cheaply, generating more middle-wage, low-skill jobs. And since red states spend less per capita on education, infrastructure and social welfare than their blue state counterparts (and many of them receive more federal dollars than they contribute), their tax burdens are lower, too.To the surprise of many, voters in four red states \u2014 Alaska, Nebraska, South Dakota and Arkansas \u2014 supported referendums in November to raise their state minimum wage. And not just by a little. Controlling for the cost of living, they will have wage floors that are higher than those of many blue states. Once Obamacare is factored in, voters in these states ironically benefit from a somewhat strengthened social safety net, even though it is one that their elected politicians mainly oppose and that is heavily subsidized by blue state tax dollars.For blue state urbanites who toil in low-paying retail, food preparation and service jobs, for the journeyman tradespeople who once formed the heart of the middle class, for teachers, civil servants, students and young families, the American dream of homeownership \u2014 or even an affordable rental apartment \u2014 is increasingly out of reach. Adding insult to injury, rapid gentrification in these larger knowledge hubs brings the constant threat of displacement of creative workers. For even the much better paid techies, engineers, financiers and managers who are displacing them, the metropolitan version of the American dream is a cramped condo or a small house and a long commute. Many are opting to move to cheaper red states instead, further driving their growth.Inequality has grown fastest over the past three decades in larger states with more vibrant knowledge economies, like Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In 1979, the most unequal states were poor conservative states \u2014 Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia. By 2012, New York, Connecticut, California and Massachusetts joined Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Tennessee among the 10 most unequal states.Blue state knowledge economies are also extremely expensive to operate. Their innovative edge turns on a high-cost infrastructure of research universities and knowledge institutions \u2014 a portion of which demand public subsidy. Their size and density require expensive subway and transit systems to move people around. Blue state cities like New York and San Francisco are booming, but they are hampered by potholes and crumbling infrastructure, troubled public school systems, growing inequality and housing unaffordability, and entrenched poor populations, all of which mean higher public costs and higher tax burdens. And yet for all that, they are pioneering the new economic order that will determine our future \u2014 one that turns on innovation and knowledge rather than the raw production of goods.Data shows that the least affordable areas lean blue politically.Despite their longstanding divisions, red state and blue state economies depend crucially on one another. Just as Alexander Hamilton\u2019s merchant cities ate and exported the harvests of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s yeomen farmers, and New England textile mills wove slave-harvested cotton, blue state knowledge economies run on red state energy. Red state energy economies in their turn depend on dense coastal cities and metro areas, not just as markets and sources of migrants, but for the technology and talent they supply.Of course, while Massachusetts and Mississippi represent the extremes of America\u2019s politico-economic divide, there are many red states like Utah, Arizona and Texas that are growing their tech and knowledge economies, and a number of historically blue states like Pennsylvania that have benefited from the fracking boom. But in our increasingly competitive global economy, long-term prosperity turns on knowledge, education and innovation. The idea that the red states can enjoy the benefits provided by the blue states without helping to pay for them (and while poaching their industries with the promise of low taxes and regulations) is as irresponsible and destructive of our national future as it is hypocritical.But that is exactly the mantra of the growing ranks of red state politicos. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a likely 2016 G.O.P. presidential candidate, has taken to bragging that his state\u2019s low-frills development strategy provides a model for the nation as a whole. But fracking and sprawling your way to growth aren\u2019t a sustainable national economic strategy.The allure of cheap growth has handed the red states a distinct political advantage. Their economic system may be outmoded and obsolete, but it is strong enough to blight the future. The Democrats may be able to draw on the country\u2019s growing demographic diversity and the liberal leanings of younger voters to win the presidency from time to time, but the real power dynamic is red.As long as the highly gerrymandered red states can keep on delivering the economic goods to their voters, concerted federal action on transportation, infrastructure, sustainability, education, a rational immigration policy and a strengthened social safety net will remain out of reach. These are investments that the future prosperity of the nation, in red states and blue states alike, requires.Heightened partisan rancor is the least of our problems. The red state-blue state divide threatens to kill the real American dream.Advertisement"}

Instead of looking at the program\u2019s immediate impact on those children and their families, it followed them once they became adults and began paying federal taxes.People who had been eligible for Medicaid as children, as a group, earned higher wages and paid higher federal taxes than their peers who were not eligible for the federal-state health insurance program. And the more years they were eligible for the program, the larger the difference in earnings.\u201cIf we examine kids that were eligible for different amounts of Medicaid over the course of their childhood, we see that the ones that were eligible for more Medicaid ended up paying more taxes through income and payroll taxes later in life,\u201d said Amanda Kowalski, an assistant professor of economics at Yale and one of the study\u2019s authors.The results mean that the government\u2019s investment in the children\u2019s health care may not have cost as much as budget analysts expected. The study, by a team that included economists from the Treasury Department, was able to calculate a return on investment in the form of tax revenue.The return wasn\u2019t high enough to pay the government back for its investment in health insurance by the time the children reached age 28, when the researchers stopped tracking the subjects. By that age, the Treasury had earned back about 14 cents for every dollar that the federal and state governments had spent on insurance. But it did suggest that, if the subjects\u2019 wages continued to follow typical trajectories as they aged, the federal government would earn back about what it spent on its half of the program by the time the children reached 60 \u2014 about 56 cents on the dollar, calculated using a formula that took into account the time value of money.Here\u2019s what that means in real numbers: The average person in the study with no Medicaid earned a total of $149,000 by age 28. For each year a person was eligible for Medicaid, that income went up by $250, and the taxes the person paid went up accordingly.The new paper was made possible by a series of policy changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s that slowly expanded Medicaid to cover more and more American children. The changes essentially happened in two phases: First, the federal government allowed the program to include older children, and then individual states approved expansion to those groups. The slow, state-by-state spread of the policy enabled the researchers to compare children who were eligible for Medicaid with a control group of similar children of the same age and family income level who were not eligible for the program. The study looked at children who were eligible for Medicaid, even though not every eligible child actually signed up.Expanded eligibility had two other important effects closely related to the earnings statistics: Children who were eligible for coverage were less likely to die before reaching 28, and they were more likely to attend college. Those are outcomes that, Ms. Kowalski points out, the government may value even if the program doesn\u2019t return any money to the Treasury.Ms. Currie said that earlier studies of children\u2019s health outcomes also suggest that children with serious illnesses often go on to be sick as adults as well \u2014 meaning they are more likely to miss work or have limited career options. Medicaid supports and funds a lot of important preventive health care for very young children. She said the lesson could be that \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201dNow that the earlier expansions have had a chance to spread, nearly every low-income child in the country is eligible for Medicaid, and more than a third of all American children are currently enrolled in either Medicaid or a closely related federal-state program, called the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201cIf this is right, then we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot more impact for the kids that are born now and in the future,\u201d said Judy Solomon, a vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Uruguay", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThe front gate of the property, seen here from inside the garden, is flanked by palm trees.A Five-Bedroom Minimalist House in Montevideo$1.3 million This minimalist stucco and stone house in the upscale Carrasco neighborhood of Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, was completely renovated in 2009 by Paula Di Bello, a local architect. It consists of two houses that were combined during the renovation process. The resulting 5,382-square-foot home has five bedrooms and four bathrooms, and an open floor plan unusual in the more traditional homes in the area.The main floor has wide-plank wood floors made of lapacho, a South American hardwood also known as ipe. The living room fireplace is faced with stone and is off center, breaking up the boxy lines of the room. Windows on either side of the fireplace look out at the pool. The dining room, which is open to the living room, has a wall of built-in cabinets and shelves for displaying glassware, and a sliding-glass door to the patio. The kitchen has large gray ceramic tiles on the floor, a double fridge and a small wine cooler that complements the larger wine cellar in the basement. A gas range is set into a center island, and the kitchen storage areas are a combination of open shelves and cabinets faced with frosted glass or wood. The kitchen window opens to allow the owners to pass food outside to the barbecue area. An extra room on the main floor is used as a studio, but could also serve as a bedroom. Upstairs, three of the bedrooms are clustered together, while an expansive 1,600-square-foot master suite is up a few steps and separated from the other rooms. The suite includes a four-piece bathroom, a massage room and a walk-in closet. Outside, a wall of vegetation, including mature trees and shrubs, shields the house from the road, creating a private oasis. Local people enjoy kite-surfing on the sandy beach about 10 blocks from the house, and the vibrant shopping area on Avenida Arocena is a three-minute drive. Carrasco, which is on the Rio de la Plata, an estuary, was originally a resort community for people who lived in Montevideo, but in time, it was absorbed by the city. The city center is a 20-minute drive from the house. The resort city of Punta del Este is a drive of about an hour and a half, with fishing villages and beaches along the Rio de la Plata on the way. Carrasco is now popular with affluent families, and there are many international private schools, golf courses and high-end restaurants in the area. The historic, early-20th-century Hotel Carrasco is now the Sofitel Montevideo Casino Carrasco and Spa. The international airport is a 10-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cUruguay\u2019s economy is expected to grow 3 percent in 2014, and a similar rate in 2015,\u201d said Juan Federico Fischer, the managing partner of the law firm Fischer and Schickendantz in Montevideo. This represents a slowdown from the average 6 percent growth rate the country enjoyed from 2003 to 2013. Mr. Fischer said the slower economy can be attributed to a slump in commodity prices; Uruguay\u2019s economy relies heavily on agricultural exports such as beef, soybeans and dairy products. The real estate market had been growing about 8 percent a year for the last several years, Mr. Fischer said, but it has slowed in 2014. \u201cThis year has been a special year for the market,\u201d said Carla Parodi, a real estate agent with Parodi Inmobiliaria in Montevideo. The World Cup soccer tournament in neighboring Brazil created a lot of excitement, she said; then Uruguay\u2019s national elections in the fall turned people\u2019s attention away from real estate. \u201cThat made the year kind of uneven, with high peaks before the soccer games and now after the elections,\u201d Ms. Parodi said. The market is picking up now that the election is over and economic policies for the next several years have been determined. Because the market has been sluggish recently, many sellers are more willing to negotiate than they have been in the past, and asking prices have come down. \u201cThis year the prices are more realistic,\u201d said Gustavo Zerbino, an agent for Bado & Perazzo Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and the listing agent for the property.In the Carrasco neighborhood, one of the more expensive and sought-after parts of the city, Ms. Parodi said many buyers prefer apartments or townhomes with amenities like swimming pools, private patios and round-the-clock security. The neighborhood also has a lot of people nearing retirement, who are looking to downsize while staying close to their familiar haunts. Because of these trends, apartments and newer townhomes in the more desirable parts of Carrasco sell for $372 to $418 per square foot, more than high-end single-family homes, which sell for $232 to $279 per square foot. This single-family house is priced at $242 per square foot. The large, older homes in the historical part of Carrasco are protected by city regulations, Mr. Zerbino said. The exteriors of historic houses cannot be altered, but the interiors can, so many are being converted into embassies or company headquarters.WHO BUYS IN MONTEVIDEOIn Montevideo, \u201cpurchases by foreigners have decreased in 2014,\u201d Mr. Fischer said, but foreigners still make up more than a third of the buyers. Most of them are Argentine or Brazilian, but Mr. Fischer estimated that about 2.5 percent of the city\u2019s foreign buyers are Americans. Most of Carrasco\u2019s buyers are local people, but the district does attract some from neighboring Argentina who are looking for a quieter, less stressful life, Mr. Zerbino said. He said some European retirees are also drawn to Carrasco, especially writers and artists. BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Uruguay. Mr. Zerbino said the buyer\u2019s share of the real estate agent\u2019s commission is 3.66 percent of the purchase price, including a value-added tax. Legal fees are about 2 percent, and transfer taxes are 1 percent. Some buyers choose to form a corporation, which costs about $2,500 to $4,500 initially and carries additional annual tax burdens and accounting fees, according to Mr. Fischer. But buying property within a corporation can have advantages in terms of shielding assets from creditors or passing property down within a family, Mr. Fischer said. Corporate ownership also offers greater privacy for buyers, so it is not uncommon, even though the costs are higher. Since Uruguay does not restrict foreign corporations\u2019 ownership of property, Mr. Fischer said it is common to see them buying Uruguayan real estate. Real estate in Uruguay is typically priced in dollars because of a history of fluctuations in the value of the peso. \u201cYou can find some rentals in pesos, but even in rentals, at the high end it\u2019s usually rented in dollars,\u201d Ms. Parodi said. \u201cThese kinds of properties are rented to people who come from abroad.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; Uruguayan peso (1 peso equals $0.041)TAXES AND FEESAnnual property taxes are $5,000, according to the listing agent.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voodoo Time Machine", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of us in the econ biz were wondering how the new leaders of Congress would respond to the sharp increase in American economic growth that, we now know, began last spring. After years of insisting that President Obama is responsible for a weak economy, they couldn\u2019t say the truth \u2014 that short-run economic performance has very little to do with who holds the White House. So what would they say?The response of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 \u201cHahahahahahaha\u201d \u2014 seems appropriate. I mean, talk about voodoo economics: Mr. McConnell is claiming not just that he can create prosperity without, you know, actually passing any legislation, but that he can reach back in time and create prosperity before even taking power. But while Mr. McConnell\u2019s self-aggrandizement is funny, it\u2019s also scary, because it\u2019s a symptom of his party\u2019s epistemic closure. Republicans know many things that aren\u2019t so, and no amount of contrary evidence will get them to change their minds.At least Mr. McConnell didn\u2019t do what many of his colleagues have done when faced with inconvenient facts: resort to conspiracy theories. Now, everyone makes predictions that turn out to have been wrong; it\u2019s a complicated world out there, and nobody\u2019s perfect. The point, however, is that Congress is now controlled by men who never acknowledge error, let alone learn from their mistakes.In some cases, they may not even know that they were wrong. After all, conservative news media are not exactly known for their balanced coverage; if your picture of how health reform is working is based on Fox News, you probably have a sense that it has been a vast disaster, even though the reality is one of success that has surprised even the law\u2019s supporters.The main point, however, is that we\u2019re looking at a political subculture in which ideological tenets are simply not to be questioned, no matter what. Supply-side economics is valid no matter what actually happens to the economy, guaranteed health insurance must be a failure even if it\u2019s working, and anyone who points out the troubling facts is ipso facto an enemy. And we\u2019re not talking about marginal figures. You sometimes hear claims that the old-fashioned Republican establishment is making a comeback, that Tea Party extremists are on the run and we can get back to bipartisan cooperation. But that is a fantasy. We can\u2019t have meaningful cooperation when we can\u2019t agree on reality, when even establishment figures in the Republican Party essentially believe that facts have a liberal bias.

{"Headline": "China Wants Taxes Paid by Citizens Living Afar", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As Chinese individuals and companies head overseas in greater numbers, the country\u2019s tax authorities are starting to follow.The Beijing billionaires who set up cryptically named companies in the British Virgin Islands to hold their fortunes are in the cross hairs. So are the Guangdong salesmen living and working in Africa and Latin America. China\u2019s tax officials are now demanding that citizens start reporting exactly how much money they earn overseas.In asking for this information, national and municipal tax agencies in China are quietly beginning to enforce a little-known and widely ignored regulation: Citizens and companies must pay domestic taxes on their entire worldwide incomes, not just on what they earn in China.The nascent campaign this winter puts China on the same side as the United States in a global debate over whether taxation should be primarily national or global. On the other side of the issue are European nations, Japan, Australia and Canada, all of which tax people within their borders but exempt most expatriates and overseas subsidiaries from paying income taxes in their home countries.\u201cThe newest element is the Chinese tax authorities\u2019 deciding to more strictly enforce this worldwide taxation, which has always been required of Chinese individuals,\u201d said Edmund Yang, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner in Beijing for international assignments. \u201cThe level of compliance among Chinese nationals overseas has been relatively low.\u201dEconomists and accountants have long debated the fairness of taxing citizens and companies overseas. Europeans have argued that expatriates use fewer government services, like state-run health care, while playing a big role in promoting exports.Advocates of worldwide taxation have contended that such exemptions are regressive and hurt lower-income individuals, as many expatriates are bankers and other high earners in finance. Expatriates may also benefit if their home countries are prosperous, well-run places with solid tax bases to which they can return someday.The roots of China\u2019s decision to embrace worldwide taxation trace to the early 1990s. Still a very poor country then, China sent teams of tax officials to the United States, Britain, Germany and other nations to seek advice on drafting a modern tax code.One team sent to the United States visited state tax officials in California and New York, said Lili Zheng, a Deloitte accountant who coordinated the visit and is now co-leader of the firm\u2019s Asian international investment practice. The team paid a long visit to the Internal Revenue Service and was given a two-volume bound copy of the United States tax code and a five-volume copy of I.R.S. regulations.Chinese officials chose the American definition of income, with its worldwide scope, in issuing their tax code in 1993. It remains in force today, although with many amendments.Now, China is taking the first steps to enforce that broad definition.The government of Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China, has summoned executives from 150 of the largest corporations based there to a meeting on Jan. 28 to discuss the obligation of their overseas employees to pay Chinese taxes. Municipal governments in Beijing and other big cities are also contacting big companies in their jurisdictions and telling them to provide detailed information on the expatriates\u2019 incomes, tax advisers said.The State Administration of Taxation in Beijing has begun a separate campaign to curb tax evasion by Chinese companies as they start to make big overseas investments. New rules taking effect on Feb. 1 will ban a wide range of international investments deemed to be tax shelters. The rules could indirectly hit many wealthy Chinese individuals, who commonly make their overseas investments through specially created companies, often located in the Caribbean.Worldwide tax enforcement could also prove a potent tool as President Xi Jingping seeks to catch corrupt officials who have fled overseas.Enforcement of the tax regulation and compliance has been low partly because China lacked data on its citizens\u2019 overseas earnings and investments. But the Chinese government has seized on the continuing United States effort to gather more information on the overseas activities of American companies and citizens. China has simultaneously been negotiating with the United States and other countries to share information on overseas bank accounts belonging to Chinese citizens.The Chinese tax enforcement effort comes as the country\u2019s economy starts to slow. With overseas investments by Chinese individuals and companies surging, national tax officials are looking for ways to collect on that trend. And local governments are seeking to develop a new source of tax revenue to offset dwindling revenue from other sources.The finances of local governments across China have deteriorated considerably in the last two years. Sales of government-owned land to developers for apartment buildings and office towers have dropped as real estate prices have fallen and housing starts have tumbled. At the same time, Beijing has overhauled its system of business taxation to the disadvantage of local governments.Local governments used to assess a tax of 5 percent on the revenue of most businesses in service industries and real estate, and shared part of the proceeds with the central government. Beijing is phasing out these taxes in favor of value-added taxes, which go directly to the central government.That has given municipalities a powerful incentive to step up enforcement of individual and corporate income taxes, which they still collect and then split with the central government. Sam Pang, a tax partner at Ernst & Young, is helping Guangzhou draft a tax enforcement brochure to give companies at the January meeting.China\u2019s decision could increase pressure for similar action by countries that face sizable budget deficits and have large numbers of affluent expatriates, like Australia, Britain, France and Ireland. Although not one of these countries has shown signs yet of switching to a different model, there has been a broad increase in interest by governments around the world in sharing more information on overseas financial accounts.While China is taking a page from the United States playbook, Beijing\u2019s tax policies in some ways are even tougher.The top income tax bracket in China is 45 percent, compared with 39.6 percent in the United States. That top bracket for the Chinese kicks in at $12,900 a month.The United States also allows expatriates to exempt a slowly rising sum of foreign earned income, which amounted to $99,200 last year. It then taxes the rest. In China, overseas citizens are eligible only for an extra deduction of $210 for each month they are overseas.Ms. Zheng at Deloitte predicted that China would pursue a few prominent cases to persuade other Chinese companies and individuals to declare their overseas income and pay taxes on it.\u201cThe law has always been there \u2014 the enforcement has previously been lacking because of limited resources,\u201d she said. \u201cChina is going to enforce some cases to let people know.\u201dAn article on Thursday about China\u2019s moves to enforce a widely ignored law requiring its expatriate citizens to pay income tax misstated the threshold for the top tax bracket in China. The top bracket, 45 percent, begins at $12,900 a month \u2014 not $12,900 a year \u2014 after deductions. The error was repeated in a picture caption.An earlier version of this article misstated the top income tax bracket in the United States. It is 39.6 percent, not 35 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Luxury, With More Mechanics and Less Bling", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: WatchesIt was a gamble on the future of the mechanical watch business, and on one aspect in particular. The breakaway firms \u2014 which also included Baume & Mercier, Piaget, Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta \u2014 staked their fortunes on the high end.\u201cWe all went that first year with questions on our minds,\u201d recalled Roberta Naas, an American watch writer and veteran SIHH attendee. \u201cWas this going to work?\u201dThe organizers anticipated, correctly as it turned out, a spike in demand for high-end Swiss watches. From 1990 to 2013, Swiss watch exports more than quadrupled in value, from about $5.4 billion to $24 billion, and the show grew in lockstep with the market.Over the years, SIHH has seen many exhibitors come and go, but it has remained an exclusive affair. Today, the 40,000-square-meter, roughly 430,000-square-feet, show is home to 16 brands, including 12 that are owned by Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont. All but a few produce timepieces that sell for upwards of $200,000.Fabienne Lupo, chairwoman and managing director of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, the fair\u2019s governing body, described SIHH as a bellwether for trends. In 2009, the show began taking place in January, as opposed to March or April, when its much larger rival, Baselworld, opens for business.Few people familiar with SIHH would quibble with Ms. Lupo. For all its exclusivity, the five-day, invitation-only event is a benchmark for the industry at large.\u201cThe fact that it happens in January gives you a jump on all the news,\u201d Ms. Naas said. \u201cYou can certainly gauge based on what you see there what you\u2019ll see at Basel.\u201dAt the 25th edition of SIHH, opening today, an emphasis on sober-looking men\u2019s timepieces with low profiles and dressy styling is expected to set the tone for a year of restraint. \u201cClassical fine watchmaking remains very strong \u2014 more than sport pieces,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lambert, chief executive of Montblanc.At Jaeger-LeCoultre, the new Master Calendar \u2014 a graceful 39-millimeter timepiece featuring a round dial fashioned from a piece of meteorite that originated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter \u2014 is an example of the watch trade\u2019s obsession with astronomy.Elsewhere at SIHH expect an abundance of skeletonized movements as watchmakers draw attention to their mechanical wizardry. Cartier will announce its third Rotonde de Cartier Astrotourbillon since 2010. This year\u2019s model, which leaves the moving parts exposed, is housed in a ghostly 47-millimeter case of 18-karat white gold.At Roger Dubuis, the iconic Excalibur collection gets an upgrade with two new models: the Excalibur Spider Skeleton Flying Tourbillon and the Excalibur Automatic Skeleton. The tourbillon, for example, comes in a 45-millimeter titanium case and, like all of the contemporary skeletons from Roger Dubuis, features a prominent asymmetrical star motif.The vogue for slim watches continues, as does the battle among watchmakers to claim the thinnest models on the market. Piaget, known for its slender movements, takes the thin-is-in quest to new heights, so to speak, with its Altiplano Chronograph, a pink gold wafer of a watch with a hand-wound movement that measures 4.65 millimeters thick.Meanwhile, IWC Schaffhausen has dedicated 2015 to its redesigned Portuguese collection, which turns 75 this year. At a press event in New York in October, the chief executive, Georges Kern, touted the brand\u2019s first annual calendar.Like many of its fellow exhibitors, IWC opted to introduce a pre-SIHH collection before the fair. While the watchmaker is not promoting its new Portofino Midsize collection as a ladies\u2019 offering per se, the line\u2019s diamond-strewn dials and 37-millimeter unisex styling clearly are intended to endear the masculine brand to a female audience. At an event in Miami in December, Mr. Kern said IWC would refrain from using its tagline \u201cEngineered for Men\u201d in ads for the new pieces.Richard Mille, the avant-garde watchmaker best known for creating technically ambitious timepieces in space-age materials, is making a similar play for the ladies market.\u201cI have been pushing very much the women\u2019s collection. I have on my back a sticker that has been written \u2018technical material,\u2019 and I wanted to escape that a bit,\u201d Mr. Mille said. \u201cThe ladies segment is increasing every year. Right now, it represents in turnover 20 percent and I am aiming for 30 to 35 percent.\u201dThe scramble for new customers is set against a backdrop of uncertainty about the medium- and long-term outlook. After years of uninterrupted growth spurred by the mechanical watchmaking renaissance of the late 1980s, and fueled in recent years by the monster appetites of luxury consumers in the Far East, the industry is bemoaning a slowdown in growth.From last January to November, Swiss watch exports totaled 19.7 billion Swiss francs, or $19.4 billion, a 2.3 percent increase over that period in 2013 \u2014 anemic growth compared with an average annual expansion of 17 percent in the three years to 2012.That said, high-end watchmakers are not going out of business anytime soon. \u201cEven if the growth is small, it is growth compared to last year, which was a record year,\u201d said Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Total exports for 2013 were $24 billion.The biggest challenge for luxury watch brands in 2015 is reconciling their expectations for growth, and the inventory already in the pipeline, with the realities of the marketplace.Now that demand in China has waned \u2014 a weakening economy and anti-corruption initiatives slammed the brakes on high-end watch sales in 2012 \u2014 many watchmakers are expanding or inaugurating brand boutiques in European or American cities to capture local clients, not to mention the waves of Chinese tourists expected to descend on foreign shores in the coming years.Panerai, for example, recently unveiled an expanded flagship salon in Florence, Italy, one of five boutiques refurbished by the Spanish architect and designer Patricia Urquiola to emphasize the brand\u2019s nautical roots. And Richard Mille now has some 20 boutiques around the world, up from 15 in 2013.This year, Mr. Mille said he intended to keep the momentum going by opening 10 brand boutiques, in cities including Munich, New York and Bal Harbour, Florida, an affluent enclave in the Miami area. He is in good company. The city\u2019s swanky new Design District opened late last year and is already home to no fewer than 11 Swiss watch brand boutiques, including Hublot, Omega, Rolex and A.Lange & S\u00f6hne.The proliferation of monobrand boutiques reflects a desire among Swiss watchmakers to eliminate the barriers that separate them from collectors and clients. To that end, many are incorporating unique outreach initiatives into their marketing plans.This spring, Roger Dubuis will close its 13-year-old Geneva boutique and replace it with a new flagship location that will include, according to Chief Executive Jean-Marc Pontrou\u00e9, \u201ca hospitality desk that will bring you to our manufacture in less than 15 minutes \u2014 for those interested in an experience beyond the store.\u201dLeft unspoken, but no doubt a topic of concern for Swiss watchmakers this year, is how the industry will cope with competition from Apple, whose first smartwatch is expected this spring.\u201cIf you want to see a classic example of people in denial,\u201d look to how Swiss watch executives have reacted to the Apple Watch, said Reid Sherard, the lead watch and jewelry researcher at L2, a market research firm in New York. \u201cThe responses range from \u2018It\u2019s not going to affect us\u2019 to \u2018It\u2019s a compliment to our product.\"\u2019Mr. Sherard said it would be foolish to misjudge Apple\u2019s potential in watches. \u201cEstimates say Apple is expected to sell 30 million devices over its first year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes Apple between a $10.5 billion to $15.6 billion watch company by revenue, passing Richemont and the Swatch Group to become the largest watch company in the world.\u201dThere are differing schools of thought about how the Swiss should respond to the smartwatch revolution. At Montblanc, the announcement of its TimeWalker Urban Speed e-Strap at SIHH suggests that some brands believe it is possible to offer a hybrid solution: The model\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled smart bracelet augments the mechanical watch\u2019s analog functionality.For Baume & Mercier, the strategy is clear. \u201cAffordability is one of the key messages,\u201d said Alain Zimmermann, the chief executive of the brand, which is introducing a redesigned Classima collection at SIHH that includes a basic automatic model that costs less than $2,000. \u201cWe are opening the back case, and improving features, but we will lower the price,\u201d he said.For most brands at SIHH, however, the tactic remains much the same as it did on the fair\u2019s first day in 1991: Maintain allegiance to the high end. For Mr. Mille, that means creating more limited-edition timepieces like the RM 19-02 Tourbillon Fleur ladies watch, which he will introduce at the fair in a series of 30, each priced as high as $800,000.\u201cIn this segment, people try to be as competitive as possible,\u201d Mr. Mille said. \u201cSo they cut the development budget, they cut costs as much as they can, and at the end, they cut also the possibility of developing fantastic products.\u201d\u201cI hate volume,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd I love extreme luxury.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Rising Airline Fees Tell Us About the Cable Industry", "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsThe day when people are no longer forced to pay for dozens of cable channels they never watch seems to be coming nearer. But subscribers may want to be careful what they wish for.But there\u2019s another, more subjective dimension in which the rise of unbundled cable service may make us worse off. It\u2019s possible for a market to become more economically efficient while becoming less pleasant for consumers. For a prime example, head to your nearest airport.A generation ago, buying an airplane ticket meant buying not just a conveyance from one city to another, but an entire bundle of goods. Among them: a seat with enough room to sit comfortably; a meal, a glass of wine or a cocktail; the right to check your bag; the right to trade in your ticket for a ticket at a different time if your plans changed.As fliers have learned all too well in the last decade, air flight has become unbundled. Want a bit of leg room? That will be a $50 upgrade for a seat in your airline\u2019s \u201cpremium economy\u201d cabin. Sandwiches are on sale for $9, a glass of wine for $7. Checking that bag costs $25, and there is a $200 change fee for your ticket, or buy a much more expensive one upfront.In effect, the airline industry has unbundled, so that you pay only for what you want.This is, traditional economic theory would posit, a good thing. If you are short of money and will tolerate bare-bones flying experience \u2014 crummy seat, nothing to eat, locking your travel schedule far in advance \u2014 you are better off than ever before. The rise of airlines like Spirit (where you even must pay to put a bag in the overhead bin) and Ryanair in Europe (a fee just to check in at the airport instead of at home) suggests the de-bundling trend isn\u2019t changing anytime soon, along with the push by major United States carriers to subdivide their cabins into more tiers of service and comfort.Any of those changes to debundle air travel, in isolation, gives consumers greater control over their flying experience and greater power to pay only for the things they care about. People who are tall or affluent may pay for the extra four inches in economy seating, for example. People who once could not afford to visit family members across the country may now be able to find bare-bone tickets within reach.But the combined effect of all these supplemental charges is to make air travel a grinding process in which a customer feels constantly assailed by upcharges and decisions that may not be stressful in isolation but make the experience unpleasant.Spirit Airlines is not just the king of unbundling air travel; it is also the king of customer complaints. According to an analysis of complaints to the Department of Transportation by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, Spirit had about nine complaints per 100,000 passengers, about three times as many as the airline with the next-most complaints.What does any of this have to do with the unbundling of cable? There are surely examples of people who would be better off in an era of cable unbundling, such as those who watch only a very small number of channels, none of them high-fee sports channels, with great regularity. They are the equivalent of the people who can afford to fly home to Grandma\u2019s house now but couldn\u2019t in a pre-unbundling air transport system.But for many more people, the result will probably be little or no reduction in total fees, combined with the hassle of making constant decisions about what channels you really want and which you don\u2019t. We already have a small version of that in my household, with the continuing debate of whether to also spring for Netflix while already paying a small fortune in monthly cable bills.Being a cynical journalist, I would probably never choose to pay for the Hallmark Channel, but have, when flipping through the channels, found it to be airing a \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d marathon that required three hours of my time.It was the equivalent of the old days when every airline seat had ample legroom and a free drink: You may not know how much you want it until after somebody makes you make the decision to pay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beleaguered, Nigerians Seek to Restore a General to Power", "Date": "2015-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKADUNA, Nigeria \u2014 Boisterous crowds packed the streets for the retired general, while young men climbed lampposts, walls and billboards to glimpse his gaunt face. Others danced on careening motorcycles, brandishing homemade brooms, symbols of his campaign.After ruling Nigeria with an iron hand 30 years ago as the country\u2019s military leader, Mr. Buhari is now a serious threat at the ballot box, analysts say, in large part because of Boko Haram\u2019s blood-soaked successes.\u201cThe state is collapsing and everybody is frightened,\u201d Jibrin Ibrahim, a political scientist with the Center for Democracy and Development in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, said of Boko Haram.\u201cThey are able to capture more and more territory, but also increase the level of atrocity,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of people are frightened that these people can take over the whole country. So a lot of people are saying, \u2018Give Buhari a chance.\u2019 \u201d\u201cWe have to solve it; it\u2019s the first problem of the country,\u201d Mr. Buhari said tersely about the battle with Boko Haram during a long day of campaigning this week.Maps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.Mr. Buhari\u2019s tenure as Nigeria\u2019s military ruler was brief: a 20-month stint in the 1980s, ended by another military coup. Yet it is remembered with trepidation by many Nigerians.The current president and his party, which has held power since military rule ended more than 15 years ago, have made this past a central part of Mr. Jonathan\u2019s re-election strategy, hoping to fan old fears about the general.Other ads remind readers of the retired general\u2019s coup-prone past. (Historians say that even before Mr. Buhari came to power in a military coup at the end of 1983, he played an active role in the coups that marked Nigeria\u2019s early years.)But Mr. Buhari\u2019s supporters are far more interested in the instability shaking the north, urging a total overhaul of the lackluster fight against the Islamists. Many of them turned out in this northern metropolis this week for a glimpse of the general, who has traded his medal-bedecked uniform for traditional robes and thick-framed spectacles.\u201cThe resources meant for the military don\u2019t go to the military; the bullets and boots don\u2019t go to the soldiers,\u201d Ms. Usman said. \u201cAnd what is happening to security, you see it in all the sectors.\u201d\u201cThe support we\u2019re giving\u201d to Mr. Buhari \u201cis for ending the insurgency,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so no more children are abducted.\u201dA retired general in the crowd of supporters, Alhassan Usman, who is not related to Ms. Usman, agreed, expressing anger that Boko Haram had gained the upper hand over Nigeria\u2019s soldiers.\u201cThe issue is lack of discipline; the commander has eaten his money,\u201d he said, arguing that officers take money meant for soldiers, who then see little reason to obey orders.Mr. Buhari stood as ramrod straight as he had in the days when he rose in a coup against Nigeria\u2019s fledgling, but corrupt, democracy. After taking power, he soon instituted what he called his attempt to straighten out a chaotic nation.That tarnished past has been, if not forgotten, at least pushed aside by many in the tumultuous jumble of Nigerian history. Mr. Buhari is expected to do particularly well in the Muslim north, his home turf, on Election Day, as he did in an unsuccessful run four years ago.Still, his campaign faces stiff obstacles. Tens of thousands of people in northern Nigeria have been displaced by relentless violence, and many of them will be unable to vote in the Feb. 14 election. Even if they can, Nigerian elections are prone to violence and fraud.This week, the streets of Kaduna were packed three-deep with people, many waiting since early morning or trekking miles from nearby villages to see him. Partisans yelled as they climbed on the general\u2019s vehicles, frenetically brushing windshields with the symbolic brooms.Mr. Buhari spoke only briefly to the packed stands in a downtown stadium, vaguely promising greater security, prosperity and better education. But the words appeared not to be the point. It was his presence, and an implicit promise of austerity and military action, that the crowd seemed to want, after years of scandalous stories in the Nigerian news media about missing oil funds and high living by officials in Mr. Jonathan\u2019s administration.\u201cThe enthusiasm for Buhari is almost like a religion,\u201d said Nasir el-Rufai, a former government minister running for governor of Kaduna State.\u201cLook at all these people,\u201d he said, pointing at the crowds pressing up against his own car before the general arrived. \u201cThey are all waiting just to see Buhari.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Buhari said that the times had changed and that he had changed with them.\u201cI operated as a military head of state,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I want to operate as a partisan politician in a multiparty setup. It\u2019s a fundamental difference. Whatever law is on the ground, I will make sure it is respected.\u201dYet it is Mr. Buhari\u2019s long military career, not the respect for civil liberties he has proclaimed later in life, that will ultimately swing voters wary of his past, analysts say.\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Boko Haram in the northeast, where they bomb churches and marketplaces, and slaughter children,\u201d Mr. Buhari said.But he also noted the security problems in the nation\u2019s south, where militants at oil fields have created havoc for years. \u201cNo highway in the country is absolutely safe,\u201d he said.Though supporters insist he will knock out the Islamists \u201cin a month,\u201d as Mr. el-Rufai put it, the retired general is far more cautious. He spoke of a methodical approach, declining to say whether he would fire the country\u2019s top military chiefs.\u201cWe have to see the whole picture,\u201d Mr. Buhari said. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask them to brief us, one by one. Why haven\u2019t they been performing?\u201d\u201cLet them justify the use of funds,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the intelligence community doing?\u201dReferring to Boko Haram, he added, \u201cWhere do they get weapons?\u201dHe focused on the individual failures in confronting Boko Haram \u2014 the misspent money, the lack of weaponry for the soldiers, their lack of motivation for the fight \u2014 rather than on an overall condemnation of the army.His jaw muscles tightening, he said, \u201cThis is not the Nigerian Army I knew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Francs, Fear and Folly", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAh, Switzerland, famed for cuckoo clocks and sound money. Other nations may experiment with radical economic policies, but with the Swiss you don\u2019t get surprises.And you should feel a shiver of fear, even if you don\u2019t have any direct financial stake in the value of the franc. For Switzerland\u2019s monetary travails illustrate in miniature just how hard it is to fight the deflationary vortex now dragging down much of the world economy.What you need to understand is that all the usual rules of economic policy changed when financial crisis struck in 2008; we entered a looking-glass world, and we still haven\u2019t emerged. In many cases, economic virtues became vices: Willingness to save became a drag on investment, fiscal probity a route to stagnation. And in the case of the Swiss, having a reputation for safe banks and sound money became a major liability. So Swiss monetary officials went all out in an effort to weaken their currency. You might think that making your currency worth less is easy \u2014 can\u2019t you just print more bills? \u2014 but in the post-crisis world it\u2019s not easy at all. Just printing money and stuffing it into the banks does nothing; it just sits there. The Swiss tried a more direct approach, selling francs and buying euros on the foreign exchange market, in the process acquiring a huge hoard of euros. But even that wasn\u2019t doing the trick.And for three years it worked. But on Thursday the Swiss suddenly gave up. We don\u2019t know exactly why; nobody I know believes the official explanation, that it\u2019s a response to a weakening euro. But it seems likely that a fresh wave of safe-haven money was making the effort to keep the franc down too expensive.What this says is that you really, really shouldn\u2019t let yourself get too close to deflation \u2014 you might fall in, and then it\u2019s extremely hard to get out. This is one reason that slashing government spending in a depressed economy is such a bad idea: It\u2019s not just the immediate cost in lost jobs, but the increased risk of getting caught in a deflationary trap.And I share that market concern. If the U.S. recovery weakens, either through contagion from troubles abroad or because our own fundamentals aren\u2019t as strong as we think, tightening monetary policy could all too easily prove to be an act of utter folly.So let\u2019s learn from the Swiss. They\u2019ve been careful; they\u2019ve maintained sound money for generations. And now they\u2019re paying the price.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Economy Expanded 1.5% in 2014", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Germany\u2019s economy accelerated in the final quarter of 2014 as consumer spending picked up, according to data published on Thursday, a sign that the largest economy in the eurozone could perform moderately better than expected in 2015.\u201cThe German economy turned out to be strong in a difficult global economic environment, benefiting especially from a strong domestic demand,\u201d Roderich Egeler, president of the statistics office, said in a statement.The strength of consumer spending was a relatively new development for Germany, where exports have often driven growth. Because more people are working than ever before, the statistics office said, more people have money to spend.The number of employed people rose by 371,000, or 0.9 percent, to 42.7 million, making 2014 the eighth consecutive year of employment growth, the statistics office said. The unemployment rate was 5 percent as of November.Germany overhauled its labor laws a decade ago, making it easier to dismiss workers, and as a result making companies more willing to hire.The data released on Thursday could support arguments by some economists that the eurozone economy will perform better than expected in 2015, in part because of cheaper oil but also because of the decline of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies, which makes eurozone exports less expensive for foreign buyers.\u201cThe positive fourth-quarter result was probably not just a flash in the pan,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients. \u201cThe underlying economic environment has improved considerably, thanks to the decline of oil prices and the euro versus the dollar.\u201dBut additional data released on Thursday could also raise pressure on the German government to spend more to stimulate growth in other eurozone countries.The statistics office said that the German government, including state and local governments, recorded a budget surplus of 11.9 billion euros, or about $14 billion, in 2014. That was the biggest budget surplus since 2000, when government coffers benefited from auctions of telecommunications licenses.Germany has faced criticism from other European countries for focusing on balancing its budget when the rest of the eurozone is in need of economic stimulus. If Germany spent more on schools, roads and other public infrastructure, some economists argue, the money would also help create demand for products from struggling eurozone countries like Italy.Adalbert Winkler, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, said it made no sense for the German government to be focusing on a balanced budget when the country could borrow money at low interest rates.German two- and five-year bonds have negative interest rates, meaning investors are willing to pay the government to keep their money safe. Even 30-year German bonds had a yield, or effective market interest rate, of just 1.2 percent on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s in our interest\u201d to invest in public services, Mr. Winkler said.\u201cGermany has always been proud of its infrastructure, its education system,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you look a little closer, you see that things are not as good as they used to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama to Outline Proposals to Bolster a Lagging Housing Sector", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The job market is stirring, gas prices are plunging and stocks are near record levels, but a housing sector that dragged the nation into the worst recession since the Depression remains the black spot in an otherwise resurgent economy.President Obama, often criticized for inattention to the housing sector, will seek to address the problem Thursday, lowering insurance rates on federally issued mortgages to first-time home buyers, minorities and struggling Americans. The move is modest, producing savings of $900 a year per home buyer.However humble, the move illustrates just how difficult it has become to stimulate the housing sector since the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals could bring 250,000 new home buyers into the market and lower refinancing costs for an estimated 800,000 homeowners, administration officials said. That is a fraction of the two million to 2.5 million homes that go to first-time home buyers a year in a healthy market. But there are no quick fixes. While housing usually leads the country out of recession, this time, it is an anchor.The financial crisis chased private lenders out of the mortgage market, leaving the federal government with a virtual monopoly. Tighter lending rules imposed after the crisis have made loans more difficult to come by. And young workers who should be first-time home buyers are saddled with student-loan debt in a job market just gaining steam.\u201cSaving the American auto industry was the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Obama told autoworkers. \u201cBetting on you was the right thing to do.\u201dThe president is only tinkering around the edges, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, the real estate website. Mr. Obama\u2019s new proposal and others like it will have little impact until incomes rise more broadly, savings expand and young adults dump their roommates and move out of their parents\u2019 houses.\u201cIt\u2019s not monkeying around with insurance premiums that\u2019s going to fix demand,\u201d Mr. Humphries said. \u201cThe fix has got to come primarily from fixing the fundamentals, especially income growth.\u201dThere should be room for improvement in the housing numbers. Devastated by the Great Recession\u2019s crash, the homeownership rate, at 64.5 percent, is where it was 19 years ago, Ms. Gordon said, and rates are far lower among minority families.But as members of the Baby Boom generation move into retirement communities, more housing will become available. And rents are soaring, an ideal environment for would-be buyers. The buyers, however, are not showing up as they should.Just before Thanksgiving, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew invited economists, demographers and real estate and credit agency executives to dinner to try to find solutions.The problems laid out by the guests \u2014 who included Mr. Humphries, Mr. Myers, Ms. Gordon and Mr. Zandi, among others \u2014 appear intractable. Members of the millennial generation \u2014 Americans born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s \u2014 are marrying and starting families at a very low rate, and their savings are meager.Private lenders have been reluctant to re-enter a mortgage market that is almost wholly owned by the federal government, either through the Federal Housing Administration or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage consolidators that were taken over by Washington at the height of the crisis. Tight credit is making it virtually impossible for millions of Americans to buy their first homes.\u201cF.H.A. has become a large-scale government subprime lender that doesn\u2019t charge enough to risky borrowers,\u201d said Mr. Oliner, who would prefer that the administration press for a large infrastructure program to improve the working-class job market.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who has been pushing to unwind the government\u2019s control of the mortgage market, called it a \u201chead-scratching decision.\u201d The move will increase competition between government agencies \u2014 pitting the F.H.A. against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and could put the F.H.A.\u2019s stretched capital reserves at risk.Of the roughly 13 million homeowners whose mortgages were once larger than the value of their home, about 10 million have since come up from under water.The president\u2019s F.H.A. move is aimed at the key problem, first-time home buyers, said Juli\u00e1n Castro, the housing secretary. Typically, such buyers account for 40 percent to 45 percent of home purchases. In the bubble years before the crash they made up half of all home buyers, Mr. Zandi said. Now they are less than a third.The president\u2019s proposal could open the market to millions just by allowing mortgage access to people now barred by their credit scores, said Barrett Burns, chief executive officer of Vantage Score Solutions.\u201cThat\u2019s boring,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cbut boring works sometimes.\u201dMichael D.

{"Headline": "Long a College Town, Worcester Now Looks the Part", "Date": "2015-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetIt does now. From one end of the city\u2019s 245-acre central core to the other, Worcester is attending to the 35,000 college students who study and live here, and its primary boulevards are steadily filling up with the civic amenities that attract new residents. They include a busy public transit hub, comfortable and affordable housing, new restaurants and watering holes, computer stores and coffee shops, a performing arts theater, biotech research facilities, incubators and office space for start-up companies, and renovated parks \u2014 including one alongside City Hall with an ice rink larger than the one in Rockefeller Center.The newest project in Worcester\u2019s revitalization portfolio is CitySquare, a $565 million, 12-acre mixed-use development just east of City Hall. It replaces a two-story, one-million-square-foot downtown shopping mall that took up almost 10 percent of Worcester\u2019s central business district.The former Worcester Center Galleria, built at a cost of $127 million, thrived for a decade after it opened in 1971, but by the turn of the century it had gone dark. In the two years since it was demolished, Worcester spent $59 million burying utilities, preparing building sites for new construction, and reconstructing and connecting four streets in the district to the city\u2019s street grid.Across the street, the Worcester Regional Transit Authority built a $14 million bus transit hub alongside 103-year-old Union Station, which reopened in 2000 after a $32 million renovation. The station is on Amtrak\u2019s Lake Shore Limited line and is a stop for 20 commuter trains daily to and from Boston that serve 1,500 passengers.In 2014, the city and Hanover Insurance Group, the primary landholder and CitySquare development manager, finished agreements with Roseland Property Company to build 370 market-rate rental apartments in a cluster of five-story residential buildings at a cost of $90 million. The first building will hold 239 apartments; the second building, 131.Construction of the residential project is scheduled to start this spring, with hotel construction to follow.Just a single 1.2-acre parcel in CitySquare remains undeveloped. City officials and Hanover executives said they were marketing the land as a prime downtown site for an office tower, with spaces for ground-floor retailing.\u201cFor so many years the old mall just served as a big roadblock for people and vehicles in our downtown,\u201d said Michael E. Traynor, the city\u2019s chief development officer.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t walk from City Hall to the train station. It just killed the spirit of this city and was a big turnoff for students,\u201d Mr. Traynor said. \u201cNow with the mall gone, new buildings in place, new streets, new businesses settling there, it\u2019s like \u2018Welcome to the 21st-century economy.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOne reason that CitySquare is developing so quickly is that Worcester had a lot of practice over the last decade rebuilding its downtown, with considerable help from the city\u2019s colleges and universities.The university has invested over $110 million in the project to build the $40 million, 125,000-square-foot Life Sciences and Bioengineering Center, which opened in 2007. Next to it is a new $32 million, 92,000-square-foot, four-story bioengineering academic and research building.Gateway Park, at the intersection of Lincoln Street and Interstate 290, includes a $20 million, 128-room Courtyard by Marriott; an $11 million parking deck; and a $39 million, 89,000-square-foot, 258-bed dormitory that opened in 2013. A $10 million, 100-room Hampton Inn is under construction.According to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Worcester\u2019s steady redevelopment, fostered by well over $1.3 billion in public and private investment, is producing results that are at the top of urban demographic and economic performance in New England. The city\u2019s population has climbed to more than 182,000 residents, up 13 percent from its modern low of under 162,000 in 1990. Worcester is now the second-largest city in New England.The jobless rate in October, 5.6 percent, was lower than the state\u2019s unemployment rate of 6 percent. The city added 6,900 new jobs from October 2013 to October 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and average wages during that period increased nearly 5 percent.Quinsigamond Community College also is involved in the city\u2019s resurgence. In 2014 the two-year college expanded its campus to a building that once was the newsroom and printing plant for The Worcester Telegram & Gazette. The building on Franklin Street, across from City Hall, was renovated at a cost of $40 million. The college\u2019s laboratories and training suites occupy 73,000 square feet of the 135,000-square-foot, four-story building.In a telling detail that illustrates just how serious college administrators are about their downtown mission, the renovation plan deliberately left out a cafeteria.\u201cPart of our plan was to put feet on the street,\u201d said Gail E. Carberry, Quinsigamond\u2019s president. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get aggressive about cafes and cafeterias. We want students to frequent the restaurants and coffee shops that are already here.\u201dA generation ago, Worcester\u2019s weary downtown was an impediment to attracting students, college administrators said. Today, shoppers, office workers and students fill the city\u2019s sidewalks.\u201cWe haven\u2019t rushed to rebuild the city,\u201d said Frederick H.

{"Headline": "AirAsia\u2019s Chief Responds to Crisis With Quick Compassion", "Date": "2014-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When an AirAsia plane carrying 162 people disappeared from the skies near Indonesia on Sunday, the Malaysian company\u2019s chief executive, Tony Fernandes, took to Twitter. \u201cThis is my worst nightmare,\u201d he wrote.Within hours, Mr. Fernandes was in Surabaya, the missing plane\u2019s point of departure, speaking with families of the passengers and crew. On Tuesday evening, after the crash site had been found, he met with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, who had arrived in Surabaya to visit the grieving families.His approach to the crisis mirrors the hands-on philosophy that has helped him to turn what was, 13 years ago, a state-owned airline with millions of dollars in debt into Asia\u2019s largest budget carrier. As he built up the brand, Mr. Fernandes became synonymous with it \u2014 the public face and promoter in chief of the business \u2014 sometimes working alongside cabin staff on flights or at reservation desks and even as a bag handler.Maps of the flight path, air traffic near the plane when it disappeared and where debris was found.The way Mr. Fernandes and AirAsia have reacted to the third fatal incident in 2014 involving a Malaysian airline is in sharp contrast to that of Malaysia Airlines \u2014 the nation\u2019s heavily indebted, state-owned flag carrier, which operated the two other planes involved in fatal incidents.Nonetheless, the biggest challenge facing AirAsia today is a new one for both the company and for Mr. Fernandes. The demise of Flight 8501 on Sunday was the airline\u2019s first major accident, and is adding to concerns about safety in a region that has experienced a boom in the number of low-cost carriers flying to destinations across Asia.Indonesia has not fared well in international safety rankings. In 2007, the United States Transportation Department\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration gave the country a Category 2 ranking, which means Indonesia\u2019s regulations do not comply with safety standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.AirAsia and its affiliates have a solid safety record, industry experts say. The company relies on a fleet of relatively newer planes composed of Airbus A320s \u2014 a model tried and tested over the years by scores of airlines around the world. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had any safety problems,\u201d Greg Waldron, the Asia managing editor for the aviation publication Flightglobal, said of the company.But, he added, there was a \u201cwarning sign\u201d in a 2013 near collision between an Indonesia AirAsia jet taxiing on a runway in Yogyakarta and a Batik Air jet that was landing. And on Tuesday a plane operated by AirAsia Zest, an affiliate of AirAsia Philippines, overshot the runway at an airport in central Philippines. No one was hurt.Mr. Fernandes, 50, came to the airline industry as an outsider. He was raised in the coastal city of Malacca, the son of a doctor from Goa, India, and a mother from Malacca who built a business across Malaysia selling Tupperware. He was sent to boarding school in Britain at age 12, and retains a polished British accent.An accountant by training, he spent the early part of his career in the music publishing business and rose to become Warner Music\u2019s top regional executive in Southeast Asia. But the music business was in turmoil because of widespread counterfeiting in Asia and the rise of online file sharing globally. In 2001, after the ill-fated merger of AOL and Time Warner, Mr. Fernandes decided to try something different.He saw his opportunity with AirAsia, a struggling subsidiary of a Malaysian state-owned conglomerate. He agreed to acquire the airline for the token sum of 1 Malaysian ringgit, or 29 cents at today\u2019s exchange rates, and signed the deal on Sept. 8, 2001, just three days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.For the first few years, he focused on turning AirAsia into a budget carrier by building local allies. Mr. Fernandes worked with the former head of Malaysia\u2019s Road Transport Department, Datuk Pahamin A Rajab, and brought in former Warner Music colleagues, Asian airline veterans and a top executive poached from Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier.He also used his position as an industry outsider to take on rivals and shake things up. The company has been relentless in cutting its cost structure to among the lowest of budget airlines globally, selling cheap flights but lifting revenue by charging customers fees on options like choosing seats or checking in at the airport counter (online check-in remains free). Competition is increasing as more budget operators pile in, but sales rose 2.4 percent in the first nine months of the year to $1.1 billion, and the company continues to make a healthy profit. It reported it flew 43 million passengers in 2013. Early on, the company began to look overseas for partners to help it expand. Business in Asia is often segregated by national borders, with state-run companies and wealthy tycoons controlling large sectors of many economies. This was particularly true in the airline industry at the time. To succeed, AirAsia expanded by forming joint ventures, taking minority stakes.It began in 2004 with a partnership in Thailand with Shin Corp, which was controlled by the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister of Thailand at the time.Over the last decade, AirAsia has expanded further. In addition to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, it also has affiliates in the Philippines and more recently, India. A sister company, AirAsia X, operates low-cost, long-haul flights. But growth hasn\u2019t always been smooth for AirAsia. In June 2013, AirAsia decided to leave the Japanese market after little more than a year, following repeated disagreements over business strategy with its joint venture partner, All Nippon Airways.Its entry to the huge, developing India market was also difficult. The venture was announced in February 2013, but AirAsia didn\u2019t begin flights until June 2014 after facing fierce opposition from local competitors.Likely to be facing his toughest challenge now, Mr. Fernandes will be squarely \u2014 and very visibly \u2014 in charge of how AirAsia responds to the investigation.\u201cI am the leader of this company, and I have to take responsibility. That is why I am here,\u201d he told reporters at the Surabaya airport Tuesday evening after meeting relatives of the passengers and crew of the downed plane. He added, \u201cEven though we don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, the passengers were on my aircraft, and I have to take responsibility for that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the federal air safety agency.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Tax Proposal Is Really About Shaping the Democratic Party After Obama", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical CalculusIt takes no masterstroke of political prognostication to conclude that this proposal is very unlikely to make its way back to Mr. Obama\u2019s desk. But in some ways, that fact makes the president\u2019s game here that much more interesting.One widespread complaint about the Democratic candidates for Senate in the 2014 midterms was that they offered no compelling governing vision, but rather scare stories about how extreme and frightening a Republican majority would be. It didn\u2019t work (Republicans won the Senate), but even if it had, it would have left in place a narrow majority without much energy or vision.So one way to read Mr. Obama\u2019s plan is that it is a first try at a post-Obama economic policy vision for the Democratic Party.It is elegantly sculpted to avoid some of the pitfalls of Obama-era partisan warfare. The president\u2019s first term was an extended battle over stimulus, deficits and the role of government. The administration\u2019s first, polarizing political battle was to enact a fiscal stimulus. Next was to expand the role of government in the health care system. The battles over deficit reduction that began when a Republican-controlled House took office in 2011 were really proxy fights for both parties, with those on the left pushing for continued stimulus and those on the right using the high deficits as a reason to reshape the scale of America\u2019s social welfare state.So with those battles calming down, the question is what will replace them. And this proposal is the president\u2019s whack at an answer.It is constructed to sidestep those old debates over the size of government; it creates no new programs, instead working entirely through the tax code. It fully pays for itself.The trade-off embedded in the plan is straightforward. It would raise taxes on people with investment income and large inheritances, and on giant banks that rely on borrowed money. It would lower taxes on working parents, including a $500 tax credit for families in which both parents work, and change existing child care tax incentives to reduce taxes for families with young children up to $3,000 per child. And it would further tweak the tax code to try to help college students and encourage the middle class to set up retirement accounts.The White House will surely be accused of class warfare, of pitting the interests of the affluent directly against the working class. But if other Democrats (particularly the party\u2019s nominee for president in 2016) seize on this basic framework, of higher taxes on capital in exchange for lower taxes on labor, it will help offer a clear vision of what the Democratic Party stands for after the Obama years.In other words, we are heading toward an election in which the two parties more or less agree on the problem facing Americans: A growing economy has done little to accrue to the incomes and living standards of ordinary workers over the past generation. But they will have starkly different answers over how to combat it.Barack Obama won\u2019t be on the ballot in 2016. But with his speech Tuesday, he will take his best stab at shaping the terms of the debate over American economic policy even once he is spending long hours on a Hawaii beach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reagan, Obama and Inequality", "Date": "2015-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ColumnistSince the end of the 1970s, something has gone profoundly wrong in America.\u201cIt\u2019s morning again in America\u201d \u2014 that was a campaign slogan by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. But, in retrospect, the average American has been stuck since the Reagan era in a predawn darkness of stagnation and inequality, and we still haven\u2019t shaken it off, particularly since 2000. Inequality has increased further under President Obama.Yet the bully pulpit still can shape the national agenda and nag at the American conscience. I don\u2019t fully agree with Obama\u2019s solutions \u2014 how could he skip over early-childhood interventions?! \u2014 but he\u2019s exactly right in the way he framed the inequality issue: \u201cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\u201dSome background. Even with the global Great Depression, the United States performed brilliantly in the first three-quarters of the 20th century, with incomes and education mostly rising and inequality flat or falling \u2014 and gains were broadly shared by poor and rich alike. High school graduation rates surged, G.I.\u2019s went to college, and the United States led the world in educational attainment.Then, for average Americans, the roof fell in around the end of the 1970s. The \u201970s were \u201cthe end of normal,\u201d the economist James K. Galbraith argues in a new book of that title. Afterward, the economy continued to grow over all, but the spoils went to the wealthy and the bottom 90 percent barely benefited.By some measures, education \u2014 our seed corn for the future \u2014 has pretty much stalled. More young American men today have less education than their parents (29 percent) than have more education (20 percent). Among industrialized countries as a whole, 70 percent of 3-year-olds go to preschool; in the United States, 38 percent do.I wonder if the celebration of unfettered capitalism and \u201cgreed is good\u201d since the Reagan era didn\u2019t help shape social mores in ways that accelerated inequality.In any case, Reagan was right on one point \u2014 \u201cthe best social program is a productive job\u201d \u2014 and Obama offered sound proposals to increase incentives for work. Better child-care and sick-leave policies would also make work more feasible. The United States is the only country among the 34 in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that provides no paid maternity leave.Oddly, Obama didn\u2019t push early-childhood initiatives, focused on kids from newborns to 5 years old, that have a particularly strong evidence base for creating opportunity. Early-education initiatives poll well, and some of the leaders in programming have been red states like Oklahoma. So while the Obama agenda is mostly for show, expansion of preschool could actually occur at least at the state level.Congressional Republicans seem focused on a pipeline that isn\u2019t even economically viable at today\u2019s oil prices. Let\u2019s hope that the national agenda can broaden along the lines that Obama suggests, so that the last 35 years become an aberration rather than a bellwether. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Chapter for America and India", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter years of near misses and unfulfilled promises, President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India appear to have set relations between their democracies on a deeper, perhaps even revolutionary, path. There are strategic imperatives at work as well. Both leaders need to expand their economies, and both see the other as a crucial partner in offsetting China\u2019s increasingly assertive role in Asia. The potential for cooperation is considerable. Much of the public focus on the visit was on trade, energy and breaking a logjam that has held up the sale of American nuclear energy technology to India. But when Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama sat down to talk, the first 45 minutes of the discussion was consumed by China.China was not happy, dismissing the visit as a \u201csuperficial rapprochement.\u201d The trick for Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi will be to stand firm in support of a stable, rules-based order in Asia while not provoking China.The modest movement on\u00a0climate change was disappointing. India agreed to move to phase down hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, in line with a treaty called the Montreal Protocol. But it set no specific goals limiting greenhouse gases, as China did in its meeting with Mr. Obama in November. India is the third-largest carbon polluter behind the United States and China but has resisted bolder measures, citing its need to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Without India on board with commitments, the best efforts of the rest of the world will not be enough.With their talk of an \u201cenduring commitment,\u201d Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi have raised expectations and set a firm basis for moving forward. Even so, the countries have no obvious plans to deal with Pakistan or the India-Pakistan nuclear competition that threatens the region, and it cannot be assumed that all past differences will fade. Building a true partnership will take sustained efforts over many decades.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marla Malcolm Beck\u2019s Three Keys to Hiring: Skill, Will and Fit", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeQ. What were some early influences for you?A. My dad was an entrepreneur. He started an insurance agency and a real estate company, and I worked in his office from the time I was 9. When I was in high school, I used to balance his books. I was also editor of the yearbook. That was interesting, because I learned that I\u2019m not really a good project manager; I\u2019m better with ideas and the creative side.I also have a lot of sports-failure stories. I loved volleyball, but during my freshman year in high school, I didn\u2019t even make the J.V. team. I was devastated, so I asked the coach what I had to do to make the team the next year, and she pointed me to a program where I played volleyball on the side for six months. I then made the J.V. team, and played varsity in my junior year and senior year, when I was the captain. I had a number of experiences like that, which taught me I could actually do anything. You just have to invest the time. You could completely fail, pick yourself up and do something great.Did you want to be in leadership positions?I just always ended up in them, even though I was shy. I wasn\u2019t the best volleyball player on the team by any means, but I was reliable. It was always about no drama \u2014 just, \u201cLet\u2019s get the job done.\u201d I probably got that from my dad. He had an amazing work ethic.What did you study in college?Political economy. I was interested in international business, but I wanted more of the theoretical and philosophical grounding. In college, I ran a student organization that was started after World War II to bring together students from around the world. We would find internships in San Francisco for foreign students. It was a global matching system, and for every one we found, we would send someone overseas on an internship.That\u2019s another failure story, a very public failure. I ran uncontested to be the president, gave a speech and didn\u2019t even get a majority of the votes. In the second election, someone ran against me, but I had interviewed a lot of people about why I didn\u2019t get the position the first time, and they said I wasn\u2019t human enough, I wasn\u2019t passionate enough. So I talked more about the mission and my dreams for the organization, and I think people respected me for getting up there again, and I got most of the votes.And after college? I worked in consulting, for McKinsey, for two years before going to business school, where I caught the entrepreneur bug. I thought I would get closer to entrepreneurship by going into private equity, which I did, but within three months I knew it was completely wrong for me. The firm I had joined was buying and consolidating companies more as a financial play than to build businesses. I was also meeting all these entrepreneurs, and I started thinking, \u201cI can do that.\u201dI had always wanted to run a company. Whenever I was in an organization or part of a team, I felt that I should be in charge, mainly because I knew where we should go. I\u2019ve always been good at figuring out the right path. I just see where things are going, how everything comes together. That\u2019s my core skill set.What about leadership lessons since starting Bluemercury 15 years ago?Early on, I kept a lot of the hard problems to myself. Not only did that put more pressure on me, but also people can start working on the wrong things, and you have no way to course-correct if you don\u2019t give them the \u201cwhy.\u201dI don\u2019t think I was brave enough early on, and I\u2019m more brave now about not keeping things to myself \u2014 things that are working, things that are not working, and just being more fluid with communication. I still catch myself now when I\u2019m asking people to do things, and I have to go back to why it\u2019s important and why we need to do this as a company.How do you hire?I\u2019m the queen of the seven-minute interview. I interview for only seven to 10 minutes, and I have a framework \u2014 it\u2019s skill, will and fit. In about two minutes, I can ascertain skill, just based on what they\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest impact you had at your past organization?\u201d It\u2019s important that someone takes ownership of a project that they did, and you can tell based on how they talk about it whether they did it or whether it was just something that was going on at the organization.Will is about hunger, so I\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhat do you want to do in five or 10 years?\u201d That tells you a lot about their aspirations and creativity. If you\u2019re hungry to get somewhere, that means you want to learn. And if you want to learn, you can do any job.In terms of fit, I\u2019m looking for people who have some sort of experience with a smaller company. At big companies, your job is really one little piece of the pie. I need someone who can make things happen and is comfortable with ambiguity. What advice do you give to graduating college students?The best advice I heard when I was in college was \u201cBe an expert at something.\u201d So bring an expertise or skill set into an organization, or be the expert at something that nobody else is doing. The second thing I would say is \u201cGo into tech.\u201d If you look at all the skill sets companies need, they involve a comfort level with technology.I would also tell students that nobody ends up in the first job they choose out of college, so just find something that is interesting to you, because you tend to excel at things you\u2019re interested in. But just go do it. You have nothing to lose.This interview has been edited and condensed. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Is Skeptical of Nuclear Talks With U.S.", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose talks are scheduled to resume Jan. 18 in Geneva, Iran\u2019s state Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday.In his first public criticism of the government of President Hassan Rouhani since his election in 2013, Mr. Khamenei said the government should \u201ctrust the people and domestic forces.\u201d He also asked officials to refrain from \u201csaying unnecessary words.\u201dHe expressed deep skepticism about the nuclear talks, warning the government that \u201cefforts must be made to immunize Iran against the sanctions\u201d so that \u201cthe people would not be hurt.\u201dThe reason for his pessimism, he said, was that America could not be trusted.\u201cThe Americans boldly say that the sanctions will not be removed all at once and immediately, even if Iran compromises. Given these facts, can such an enemy be trusted?\u201d Mr. Khamenei asked.Tehran insists that it is pursuing a nuclear program for peaceful purposes, but the Western powers say that it is intent on building a nuclear weapon. Any deal to contain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions is expected to call for a gradual relaxation of sanctions, as Mr. Khamenei has suggested.But in the United States, the Republican-held Congress has talked lately of increasing sanctions, rather than easing them, and it is expected to be highly suspicious of any deal the Obama administration reaches with Tehran.Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.For his part, Mr. Khamenei has the final say on strategic matters in Iran and will ultimately decide whether to accept a nuclear compromise. The recent drop in oil prices may be a factor in his thinking, with an expected $30 billion decline in revenues worsening an already grim economic outlook.On Sunday, Mr. Rouhani said the economy was in a bad state and that it could no longer be held hostage to an anti-American and anti-Western ideology and should be treated less ideologically. He also said that direct referendums must be organized so that ordinary Iranians could exercise more influence over important national decisions, like the nuclear deal.Mr. Khamenei seemed to be answering those remarks, saying the nation had enjoyed great success, in contrast to the \u201cwrong and uncalculated remarks that some make.\u201dIn past speeches, Mr. Khamenei has referred to the nuclear negotiating team as \u201cchildren of the revolution.\u201d He did not do so on Wednesday and instead warned against trusting the enemy, which is a usual reference to the United States and its allies.\u201cNo one should imagine that the enemy may stop its enmity and maliciousness,\u201d Mr. Khamenei said. \u201cOnce you forget and trust the enemy, then the enemy finds the chance to pursue its goals in the country. But if you identify the enemy and you are strong, ready, arrogance will inevitably stop its enmity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It felt a lot longer sitting on the cream-colored, quilted vinyl seat of the Ford, which had lost a lot of its spring in the years since Fidel Castro swept into power.The vintage Ford was not part of the original plan.It was Christmastime, and flights across the island were sold out and the rental cars were all rented. So I started looking for a driver, preferably someone with a newish car. I didn\u2019t want to get stuck on the roadside in some broken-down Soviet-era Lada or a rusting relic from the Eisenhower administration.When Julio C\u00e9sar L\u00f3pez showed up in his big Ford at my hotel, the Habana Libre, I almost dismissed him out of hand. But he said that he had recently replaced the motor, and that the car had made several trips across the island and back. He even promised to replace the bald front right tire and change the oil.We had a deal.Along the way, a slowly changing Cuba revealed itself, sometimes through what was there and sometimes through what was not.More signs of the times:There were also discouraging signs:One was the lack of little bars on my phone, showing that there was no cellular coverage in the areas between cities, an indication of Cuba\u2019s backward telecommunications network.There was a near absence of trucks carrying merchandise or farm produce, a sign of an economy that barely ticks.While there was little car and truck traffic, there was a lot of everything else. Sharing the highway with us were bicycles, oxcarts, tractors, motorcycles (some with sidecars) and horsecarts of every type (large and small two-wheeled farm carts, four-wheeled carts that carried up to 10 passengers, and light carriages that served as taxis).And there were lots of breakdowns, which is to be expected when a high percentage of the cars on the road were manufactured before John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960.An hour out of Havana, a man with no shirt leaned on a gray Lada with the hood up, not having bothered to move it off the road. Near a town called Torriente, a couple kissed passionately beside a broken-down red Chevy. Near Santiago de Cuba, a woman with an anxious face sat surrounded by a brood of children in the back seat of a stalled, burnt-orange Buick.I never saw a tow truck.Cuba is a beautiful island, green and fertile, a poem of vibrant color and sensual light:A scarlet sunset bleeds across the Caribbean sky, bruised purple at the edges.In the heat of the day, a woman in a shocking pink shirt walks under a red parasol.An old man in jonquil pants sits on a fence.Pale green sugar cane grows in red dirt fields.On Day Two, we had breakfast at the Ciego de \u00c1vila Hotel, nearly smack in the center of the island, a decaying throwback to an age of Soviet-financed plans to build big resorts for vacationing workers.Done up in peeling, garish green and gold, it was a jumble of window boxes sprouting miniature palm trees, concrete arches and balconies. The swimming pool sparkled blue and empty. Of 147 rooms, only about 15 were occupied; there seemed to be more workers than guests.We drove with the windows down, swaying over the blacktop, the air beating around us. The big engine hummed. Mr. L\u00f3pez, my driver, babied the car over the bumpy stretches, which got more frequent the farther we got from Havana. The Ford was full of rattles and bangs, and when we hit a bump it was like shaking a can loaded with nickels. There were small vent windows in the front, and no seatbelts.The odometer was stuck at 26948.0. How many times had it turned over before freezing? Cuba, too, is frozen in the past. Younger Cubans, and many older ones too, are aching for the odometer to start turning again.This car is beautiful and old and tired. Cuba is all those things.Five years ago, he said, people talked about politics. What Fidel said. What Ra\u00fal was going to do. Now they talk about money and business.The average salary in 2013 was about $20 a month, according to the government. People told me that could easily be eaten up by monthly bills for a cellphone, electricity and other basics, though some other expenses, like education and health care, are covered by the government.The gap between what people earn and what things cost was a constant topic of conversation. Many people rely on money sent to them by relatives abroad. Many are in a constant struggle to get by, raising and selling pigs, buying or selling products on the black market, starting a business or waiting tables in a paladar.Yasmani B\u00e9rbes, 27, quit his job as a physical education teacher to run a restaurant in his family\u2019s house in Contramaestre, a town near Santiago de Cuba. As a teacher, he made 500 pesos a month, or about $21. \u201cHere, there are days now when I can make 500 pesos,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a positive change in the Cuban population,\u201d Mr. B\u00e9rbes said. \u201cThey\u2019ve opened up a lot to the idea of doing business.\u201d He had less faith in the country\u2019s leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of people with a 19th-century revolutionary mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of taboos and prohibitions.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez, who is about half the age of his Ford, was a careful motorist \u2014 his car was his livelihood.\u201cIf I had the choice, I\u2019d pick a modern car,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a modern car, what we\u2019re doing in 12 hours we could do in nine.\u201d (He was also an optimist: The trip ended up taking 17 hours over two days, although that included small detours and meals.)But he said that having any car at all was a blessing because it gave him a way to make a living. I told him that lots of people abroad saw old cars like his as a quaint symbol of revolutionary Cuba.I asked him what the car symbolized for him. \u201cMoney,\u201d he said.An earlier version of the inset map with this article misspelled the name of the Cuban capital.

John McCain\u2019s pick of an uninformed demagogue, Sarah Palin, was supposed to be a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Desperate campaigns look for a \u201cknockout punch,\u201d or make a \u201cswing for the fences.\u201d My favorite is President Obama\u2019s description of Joe Biden\u2019s endorsement of gay marriage ahead of his boss \u2014 he \u201cgot out a little bit over his skis.\u201dBut back to the miracle finish last Sunday, and the lesson beyond pro football: It\u2019s not about the miracle, it\u2019s about the finish. Obama has been sleepwalking through the middle part of his presidency. The brutal midterm electoral crushing, with Republicans gaining their largest House majority since Herbert Hoover, slapped him from his stupor.No longer does he care about pleasing the insiders, or playing nice with the opposition, or conforming to the expectations of a lame duck. He said it\u2019s the fourth quarter of his presidency, \u201cand I\u2019m going to play offense.\u201d He\u2019s decided to be Russell Wilson after throwing four interceptions.Many have written him off. The reliably dyspeptic Charles Krauthammer said the epitaph of the Obama presidency would be: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t govern, but he sure knew how to campaign.\u201d And yes, little of what Obama proposed in his State of the Union address will find its way out of the dead zone of Congress. Just 5 percent of his 2013 proposals became law \u2014 and that was before Republicans gained the Senate.The president\u2019s proposals \u201care so out of touch you have to ask if there\u2019s any point to the speech,\u201d said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.But if you look beyond capital gasbags, and consider the big ideas in Obama\u2019s speech, you can see the inevitability of his philosophy. His proposals \u2014 raising the minimum wage, paid maternity leave, making college more affordable and the tax system more fair \u2014 are popular across the political divide. They\u2019re mainstream anywhere but the fund-raisers that Reince Priebus presides over.Obama has already changed health care in a country that lags far behind the rest of the world in access. He\u2019s overseen an economic recovery that defied all the apocalyptic predictions of his enemies, and would be the envy of any European country \u2014 let alone one governed by Mitt Romney, who\u2019d be taking a victory lap with the kind of numbers Obama has generated on his watch.Consider Idaho, arguably the reddest state in the union, where Republicans control everything but a handful of latte stands. After much bluster and protest, Idaho politicians caved and set up a state health care exchange under Obamacare. To the surprise of the experts, Idahoans have embraced the private coverage available under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cone of the most successful enrollments of any state,\u201d as Kaiser Health News reported.Obama was in Boise on Wednesday, speaking to a crowd of more than 6,000 people at an event where all tickets were gone within an hour. \u201cNow there are 10 black people in Idaho,\u201d was one of the tweets from Boise. The president was fully energized, jocular, primed for a strong finish. A handful of protesters held up the usual hate posters, one comparing him to Hitler. But it did not escape notice that his motorcade passed a Shell station selling regular gasoline for $1.77 a gallon.To the west, in the Eastern Washington district of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, people represented by this robotically doctrinaire leader of the Republican House have signed up for Obamacare coverage at a rate far beyond the national average.To the east, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio told a group of Montana Republicans this week that they would be crazy not to embrace the president\u2019s program of health coverage for the poor. \u201cI gotta tell you, turning down your money back to Montana on an ideological basis, when people can lose their lives because they get no help, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me,\u201d he said, in remarks reported by the Great Falls Tribune.Nearly every proposal in the State of the Union address polls with majority approval, nationwide. The great issue of the early 21st century is how to elevate a stagnant middle class. When 80 people hold the same amount of wealth as 3.6 billion of the world\u2019s poorest, that equation of inequality can catch the attention of even the most heartless.So, to the end game, in Idaho, Kansas and beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to,\u201d Obama said on Tuesday. He was quoting from a Minneapolis woman, invited to the speech, but it sounded like a motto for his last two years in office.The president is playing for a legacy. He won\u2019t get much of it this year, or even next. But eventually, if Obama\u2019s finish matches the flourish of the last two months, the United States will resemble the country he envisioned on Tuesday night. Long odds make for better endings.Advertisement"}
