{"Headline": "Two Schools of Thought, Adding Up to Success ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGROWTH and value styles of investing are often described as opposites, but managers of three of the better-performing funds of the fourth quarter of 2014 don\u2019t see it that way.Instead, while they seek companies with steadily growing earnings, they also borrow an attribute from the playbook of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing and Warren E. Buffett\u2019s professor at Columbia Business School. That is, they aim to invest in companies with sustainable competitive advantages, like a well-known brand or a commanding position in a market, that will enable them to increase their earnings year after year.A Return-on-Equity TestConsider Becton Dickinson, the fund\u2019s second-largest holding at the end of September. It makes syringes and other medical tools and tests and is expanding in the developing world.The fund also looks only at companies with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. That requirement, with the R.O.E. screen, limits the pool of candidates to about 200 companies, Mr. Schoenstein said. The managers then winnow further, building a portfolio of only 25 to 30 companies. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds about 150 stocks.Mr. Schoenstein said he and his colleagues believed that active managers should invest with conviction. Actively managed funds that spread their money widely can end up looking like \u201cenhanced index funds,\u201d he said.The managers also sock away stocks for years: The average turnover ratio of the fund\u2019s holdings is just 14 percent. \u201cWe believe that enduring wealth comes from owning great companies for a long time,\u201d Mr. Schoenstein said.The fund returned 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Over the five years through December, it returned 13.5 percent annualized, compared with 15.4 percent for the index. Its retail shares carry an expense ratio of 0.88 percent.The Hunt for StrengthGoogle recently represented about 8.5 percent of the fund. Polen owns Class A and C shares in the company. Mr. Davidowitz said he and his co-manager, Damon A. Ficklin, favored companies, like Google, that dominate their markets. Thus, the fund invests in both Visa and MasterCard. \u201cIn the U.S., about 50 percent of personal consumption expenditures are done on credit cards,\u201d Mr. Davidowitz said. \u201cGlobally, it\u2019s still 85 percent cash and checks,\u201d with the card share expected to grow. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge trend in their favor.\u201dWhat all of the companies in the fund share, besides competitive muscle, are \u201cpristine balance sheets \u2014 flush with cash and little or no debt,\u201d Mr. Davidowitz said..Though the Polen fund invests in growth companies, it always includes some of what Mr. Davidowitz called \u201csafety stocks,\u201d like Nestl\u00e9 and Abbott Laboratories. These balance riskier bets in fields like biotech. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for cheap stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for that compounded earnings growth.\u201dThe fund returned 9.9 percent in the fourth quarter and has returned 16.5 percent, annualized, since its inception in September 2010. Its retail shares carry an expense ratio of 1.25 percent.Favoring Small Industrials\u201cWe spend a lot of time thinking about barriers to entry,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cThat\u2019s really important in the small-cap world. Many of our companies can have competitors that are larger and better funded.\u201dTheir pondering often leads them to the industrial sector; their fund has a larger stake in industrials than the typical small-cap offering tracked by Morningstar. They like the niche because they believe that industrial customers are more reluctant to shop around than retail ones, Mr. Modi said. \u201cAnything I buy in one store, I can get somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if someone is supplying an aerospace component to Boeing, it\u2019s harder for Boeing to switch, and it\u2019s probably not going to switch for a 5 percent savings.\u201dInsights about buyer inertia also pointed them to software and services companies selling to the financial industry, Mr. Modi said. An example is SS&C Technologies Holdings, which markets to money managers and other financial outfits. \u201cTheir client retention is in the 90 percent range,\u201d partly because customers do not want the headaches of switching providers, he said.Mr. Coleman and Mr. Modi aim to invest in high-quality companies, but the returns of small-cap stocks tend to zigzag. \u201cSo you need to wear your seatbelt,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cBut we hope, with our fund, you don\u2019t also need a mouth guard and a neck brace.\u201dJanus Venture, whose D shares have an expense ratio of 0.84 percent, returned 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 19 percent, annualized, over five years.An article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly on Jan. 11 about the best-performing mutual funds misattributed two quotations. It was Maneesh J. Modi \u2014 not his co-manager Jonathan D. Coleman \u2014 who explained Janus Venture\u2019s investment strategies using Boeing and SS&C Technologies as examples.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Drives Bond Rally in Asia", "Date": "2015-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaSINGAPORE \u2014 Plunging oil prices have brought a big rally in Asian government bond markets, as lower fuel costs have cut inflation expectations, but the rally could be built on shaky foundations: Makers of monetary policy remain out of step with tumbling bond yields.The price of oil, of which Asia is a net importer, has halved in less than six months, driving bond yields down across the region. From India to South Korea, markets seem to be anticipating looser monetary policy to accommodate the resulting slowing of inflation.The imminence of further monetary easing in Europe and Japan builds a strong case for bond yields to drop further.But there is little sign yet of official rate cuts, particularly in markets like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, where central banks were sounding aggressive or even raising rates into the final months of 2014.\u201cThe oil price has caught central banks by surprise,\u201d said ING\u2019s chief Asian economist, Tim Condon.\u201cThe panic of 2013 is right now foremost in their minds, and they are looking at a Fed rate hike, and so I think they will remain pretty dug in,\u201d he added.The fear of a repeat of 2013\u2019s \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when talk of the Federal Reserve\u2019s withdrawing monetary stimulus prompted vast sums of foreign capital to bail out of the region, helps explain why Asian central banks might err on the side of tighter monetary policy.But there are other factors that also suggest official policy will stay tighter than the bond markets imply.For one, a rising United States dollar is pushing down all emerging market currencies, which indirectly eases monetary conditions for Asian policy makers and creates pressure on them to keep interest rates up to prevent the flight of foreign cash.The market mismatch is evident in Indonesia, where the rupiah has fallen 9 percent against the dollar in the past six months.Ten-year Indonesian government bond yields, which are normally significantly higher than overnight policy rates to reflect the risk of holding bonds to term, are just 0.05 percentage point above the 7.75 percent policy rate, having fallen 0.6 percentage point since mid-December.One plausible scenario that could bring about a bond market tumble is a drastic improvement in United States growth numbers in the next couple months as a result of lower oil costs, leading to renewed optimism about global growth and an increase in Treasury bond yields.Far from cutting rates, policy makers might then have to raise rates.The odds of this high-growth scenario playing out are perhaps reflected in how well equity markets have held up despite worries about slowing inflation, patchy economic growth and the possibility that Greece could return to the emergency room.Despite a wobbly start to 2015, Asian shares are up 6 percent in the past three months.\u201cWe are apparently on the edge of deflation, and yet equity markets aren\u2019t collapsing,\u201d said the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Claudio Piron. \u201cAnd there are certain elements to what is going on which are reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis \u2014 oil prices falling, dollar strengthening, bonds rallying strongly \u2014 which all seems very ominous.\u201dWith the exception of Thailand, none of Asia\u2019s central banks have explicitly spoken of the need for easier policy.Inflation has slowed sharply, except in Indonesia and Malaysia, where fuel subsidies were cut late last year.Although consumer price inflation in the Philippines is well below the central bank\u2019s expected 3 percent average for the year, the rhetoric from policy makers suggests markets may hope for rates to be on hold.On the other hand, Indonesia\u2019s inflation is running at nearly double the official forecast range for this year, thanks to a jump in domestic oil prices.Mr. Condon of ING does not expect any of Asia\u2019s central banks to react in a hurry to either oil or slowing inflation, and instead says they might be prepared to tolerate lower inflation, just as the European Central Bank and Fed do.\u201cThere is some sort of asymmetry there. It\u2019s O.K. to undershoot inflation; it\u2019s prohibitive to overshoot. That, I think, will be the story in Asia as well,\u201d he said.Some market participants recognize that bias, which is possibly why short-end yields in Asian bond markets have not moved much. But in longer-term yields, investors might read a warning that 2015 will hold more pain than gain. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trying to Capitalize on Lower Oil Prices, Through E.T.F.s", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byONE of the biggest events in an eventful fourth quarter of 2014 may have been something that didn\u2019t happen.As crude oil prices plunged during the period, investors counted on Saudi Arabia to announce a production cut to support the market when OPEC met in late November. The Saudis did not, and the decline accelerated.West Texas Intermediate, the main American grade, fell 41.4 percent in the last three months of the year, to $53.46 a barrel. The price hit its 2014 peak, near $108, in June.Those E.T.F.s provide broad exposure to energy. Others provide access to niches within the sector, like exploration and production, drilling and pipeline operation, that differ in their sensitivity to energy prices. That can make them more useful than mutual funds for investors who know exactly what piece of the industry they want to emphasize or how much risk they are willing to take. But which themes should investors want? These funds are not for everyone: There is little consensus on which way oil and related assets will head next, with reasonable cases made for prices to move in either direction. American economic growth is accelerating, and the market is deeply oversold, the bulls say. Growth is slowing in China and virtually nonexistent in Europe, the bears counter, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision not to come to the market\u2019s rescue bodes ill for a swift rebound.A sustained oil-price decline is unlikely \u201cto be reversed until a broader-based environment of worldwide economic growth results in enough new demand to absorb that growing capacity,\u201d Mr. Mark said in a note to shareholders. \u201cEven in today\u2019s uncertain geopolitical environment, production in Libya is going up, production in Iraq is being maintained and production in the Western Hemisphere is increasing.\u201dBut investors may still find winners against such a backdrop, especially after the steep plunge in energy stocks. Mr. Morris recommends the shares of domestic refinery operators.\u201cU.S. refiners have substantial competitive advantages relative to their European counterparts,\u201d he said, \u201cand U.S. stocks in the industry are likely to outperform those of the more expensive exploration and production companies.\u201dMr. Steinberg cautioned that investing in refiners amounted to making a geopolitical forecast, always a tricky proposition. Refiners make money from the gap between what they pay for crude oil and what they get from selling refined products like gasoline.Brent crude, the main European grade, has been trading at a high premium over domestic crude, partly because of tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, he noted. That lets American refiners benefit from lower input costs and high global prices for refined goods, a perfect combination that may not last.Mr. Steinberg said that almost any energy investment would perform well if oil bounced back to $100 a barrel, but that he preferred the safer end of the spectrum, especially operators of storage centers and pipelines.\u201cIf you own a pipeline, you don\u2019t care if oil is $50 or $100, as long as it\u2019s moving from Point A to Point B,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the food chain that I want to be in.\u201d Investors have been selling shares of these safe businesses despite the tenuous connection to energy prices \u2014 leaving them cheap, in his view.Although he prefers to invest company by company, Mr. Steinberg acknowledged that not everyone could survey the investment landscape with the same circumspection. He considers E.T.F.s useful alternatives.\u201cFor somebody who doesn\u2019t have the time or ability to do individual-company analysis, then, absolutely, E.T.F.s are the right way to go,\u201d he said.Those companies have \u201ctaken it on the chin,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we think they\u2019re undervalued.\u201d The Market Vectors E.T.F. was down 25.3 percent for the full year and 38.1 percent from its high in early July. John Gabriel, an analyst at Morningstar who covers energy E.T.F.s, likes the Market Vectors fund for similar reasons. It trades about 21 percent below where it should, he said, based on the fair values that Morningstar analysts calculate for the portfolio\u2019s stocks, and he prefers vehicles that provide comparatively undiluted exposure to a rally in oil. \u201cThis is probably where you\u2019re going to get the most bang for your buck,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to bottom-fish and ride the rebound,\u201d he added, such a fund \u201cis going to give you the most leverage.\u201dFor investors interested in broader exposure, Mr. Rosenbluth suggested the Energy Select Sector SPDR. He said its portfolio was concentrated in large companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Schlumberger, that offer consistency and strength, traits that could come in handy while the sector finds its footing.\u201cOil will stabilize and move higher at some point,\u201d he predicted, \u201cbut the recovery will be choppy, so larger companies will hold up better.\u201d\u201cEnergy is the most attractive sector based on valuations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart, but for someone who wants to invest for the long term, this might be a good opportunity.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In India, a Banker in Defense Mode", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI \u2014 Few central bankers in emerging markets have been as internationally lionized as Raghuram G. Rajan of India.Mr. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has been honored with awards this winter for his role in helping to bring momentum back to the country\u2019s economy. His unexpected interest rate cut on Thursday helped strengthen emerging market stocks around the world.At home, the view is less favorable, as Mr. Rajan finds himself caught in a political struggle.The coalition of Hindu conservatives and small-business owners who form the political base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi want deeper rate cuts and other policies to help borrowers and stimulate economic growth. Mr. Rajan\u2019s critics contend that he has been so focused on reducing inflation that he has not paid enough attention to tumbling world oil prices or the heavy debt burdens of many Indian companies.\u201cHe believes the best way to reduce the temperature of a patient is to kill him,\u201d said Subramanian Swamy, the chairman of the strategic affairs committee of Mr. Modi\u2019s party and a former commerce minister and law minister.The situation reflects Mr. Rajan\u2019s bigger dilemma. At 5 percent, inflation in India is high, compared to the rest of the world. But it is low enough by India\u2019s standards that political support is splintering over further action to address the issue. While Western-trained technocrats like Mr. Rajan are still concerned about price increases, populists and businessmen in Mr. Modi\u2019s political base are not.At the same time, economic growth, which is expected to reach 6.4 percent this year, looks robust by Western standards. Even so, growth is not enough to satisfy many of Mr. Modi\u2019s backers, who promised the economy would spring forward if freed from heavy government regulation and taxation. They now want the central bank to help the process by stimulating lending.In an hourlong interview Wednesday afternoon at the Reserve Bank\u2019s headquarters overlooking Mumbai\u2019s financial district, Mr. Rajan said that he was not feeling pressure to change the direction of monetary policy. He described a harmonious working relationship with Mr. Modi\u2019s top economic policy makers. \u201cWe completely understand each other,\u201d he said.Mr. Rajan defended his decision not to lower interest rates at his last monetary policy review on Dec. 2. While oil prices had already fallen considerably by then, he said there was no way to foresee the abrupt plunge that followed, or to pass judgment on how long prices would stay low.In a news release on Thursday, Mr. Rajan made such a judgment, saying, \u201cCrude prices, barring geopolitical shocks, are expected to remain low over the year.\u201d He reduced the bank\u2019s main overnight loan rate by a quarter percent, to 7.75 percent.Despite the move, Madhav Nalapat, a Manipal University professor with close ties to the conservative wing of Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, predicted that the party\u2019s conservatives would remain deeply unhappy with Mr. Rajan, a holdover from the previous government.\u201cHe\u2019s good for Wall Street,\u201d Professor Nalapat said. \u201cHe\u2019s not good for our Main Street.\u201dThe acrimony that has greeted Mr. Rajan\u2019s slowness to reduce interest rates is symptomatic of why India in particular has tended to tolerate more inflation and of the particular challenges facing central bank leaders in emerging markets.Many companies in India are heavily indebted and are in favor of rising prices, which make it easier for them to afford fixed monthly payments.Compounding the anger is that Mr. Rajan has interpreted broadly his mandate as the country\u2019s top financial regulator as well as monetary policy maker. Mr. Rajan has repeatedly urged the country\u2019s mostly state-owned banks to step in and replace management at struggling, indebted companies, instead of waiting for them to fail and default on loans.He has also insisted that banks start requiring the founders and controlling shareholders of big companies to provide more collateral and give personal guarantees for large bank loans extended to their businesses. That has set off considerable indignation in India\u2019s business elite, which has periodically been able to persuade state-owned banks to expunge debts during hard times, sometimes while retaining their holdings in the same companies.But Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said that he had no plans to relent.\u201cIf they do take the risk, they should pay the costs of taking that risk, rather than benefit when that risk pays off but shove the cost on somebody else when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Another criticism is that Mr. Rajan did not try to reverse the rupee\u2019s steep fall against the dollar, which occurred in the summer of 2013, before he took office in September of that year. This has meant that Indians who had borrowed dollars overseas need more rupees to repay their debts. The central bank has even been intervening in currency markets in ways that tend to prevent the rupee from rising against the dollar: spending rupees to buy more dollars for its foreign exchange reserves.Mr. Rajan defended this move, saying that India needed to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves, which had been depleted during the rupee\u2019s rout in 2013. He also noted that because the rupee had been steady against the strong dollar of late, it had generally been rising this winter against most currencies.The job of governor of the Reserve Bank of India is a strange hybrid, a holdover from British colonial rule, which ended in 1947, with the checks and balances of democracy grafted on.Unlike the practice at the United States Federal Reserve and many other central banks, where interest rate changes are voted on by a committee, such decisions in India are the personal responsibility of the governor, although he may consult with others. The reserve bank also has an unusually broad array of regulatory powers, many of which are not subject to judicial review. It oversees bank licensing, bank regulation, bond trading and consumer protection.But the central bank governor has less independence, at least on paper. The governor may be dismissed and replaced by the finance minister, who may also order the governor to make an interest rate change, although the order must be issued in writing. Because either move would be highly contentious, finance ministers have refrained over the years from exercising these powers.Some conservatives around Mr. Modi want to see Mr. Rajan removed. Mr. Swamy, who was a president of the Janata Party before its merger with Mr. Modi\u2019s party, predicted on Thursday that Mr. Rajan would someday be forced to resign.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they kept him; they didn\u2019t even appoint him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was appointed by the last government.\u201dBut Mr. Swamy acknowledged that Mr. Rajan retained the strong support of the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, a longtime pillar of the New Delhi establishment. Another friend of Mr. Rajan, and his former colleague at the I.M.F., Arvind Subramanian, became the government\u2019s chief economic adviser in October.Mr. Rajan brushed away questions about political tensions sounded. He sounded wistful only once during the interview on Wednesday, when he explained why he ran half-marathons.\u201cI have never run a full marathon, and my wife will not let me run one,\u201d he said. \u201cShe says that\u2019s tempting fate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Initial Tremors, Markets Mostly Shake Off Greek Election Results", "Date": "2015-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Financial markets on Monday largely took in stride the results of Greek parliamentary elections, which handed a decisive victory to the left-wing Syriza party a day earlier.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent soon after the opening bell. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of eurozone blue chips, rose 0.6 percent in European afternoon trading, while the FTSE 100 index in London slipped about 0.1 percent. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.1256.Markets had trembled initially, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond in the United States to a record low in early trading, as investors moved funds to assets perceived as safer. The euro briefly dropped to $1.1098, its lowest level since 2003.Stocks in Athens fell 3.6 percent.The election result was largely in line with analysts\u2019 predictions, and investors had had weeks to adjust their portfolios to reflect the possibility that a showdown over the future of Greece\u2019s economic direction was near, pitting Athens against Brussels.The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the prospects for global growth were dimming \u2014 with the notable exception of the United States \u2014 raising the specter of a slowdown that would exacerbate the problems of low-price pressures and growing inequality.Derek Halpenny, the European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London, said in a research note that he did not expect the change in Athens to create \u201cexistential risks\u201d to the euro, or for strong euro-selling pressures to emerge in the short term.But Mr. Halpenny said that there were \u201ccertainly increased risks, and an error in the negotiating stage could mean this becomes a bigger negative for the market.\u201dEuropean bonds, whose prices had been rising for months in anticipation of the European Central Bank\u2019s move last week to stimulate the economy, showed little movement on Monday.Greek bond prices fell amid the postelection uncertainty, sending their yields higher, to 8.70 percent \u2014 the highest in the eurozone. Yields reached a recent peak of 10.3 percent on Jan. 7, when pre-election jitters were strongest.Perhaps the biggest question for financial markets is what the Syriza victory will mean for Greek bonds, particularly in light of the plan announced by Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, last week. The central bank plans to buy up a significant part of the bonds issued by each of the 19 eurozone governments, something that could bring substantial relief to the Athens government\u2019s borrowing costs.But Mr. Draghi noted at a news conference on Thursday that, \u201cThere are obviously some conditions before we can buy Greek bonds,\u201d including that the Greek government honor its bailout program.If Athens meets the conditions, the European Central Bank \u201ccould buy bonds in, I believe, July,\u201d Mr. Draghi added.The German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which often reflects the opinion of the business community, stated in an initial analysis: \u201cTsipras will not be able to escape one fact: Greece needs more foreign money, whether from the markets or from the European Union. He has a choice between compromises with the troika and a huge state bankruptcy that could lead his country further into the abyss.\u201dChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in an interview posted on the website of the French daily Le Monde on Monday that Greece still had to honor pledges it made as part of a bailout plan.Athens committed to overhaul government administration and tax collection, and to reduce delays in the legal system, Ms. Lagarde said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t austerity measures, these are fundamental reforms that remain to be carried out,\u201d she said.Asked by Le Monde about Mr. Tsipras\u2019s pledge to restructure Greece\u2019s debt, Ms. Lagarde responded that there were \u201cinternal rules of the eurozone to be respected.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t make special categories for this or that country,\u201d she said.Asian stocks were mixed, with major indexes in Tokyo falling about 0.3 percent and Hong Kong shares rising 0.2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Feisty Finance Minister Tries a More Moderate Message", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 In the first days after the election victory of the leftist party Syriza in Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, the new finance minister, has lobbed some rhetorical grenades, referring to his country\u2019s foreign-imposed austerity budgets as \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d and calling Greece\u2019s international bailout deals \u201ca toxic mistake.\u201dNow, faced with the need to make good on promises to negotiate debt relief for his beleaguered nation, he seems eager to send a more moderate message.During an interview on Thursday morning in his office, Mr. Varoufakis, 53, poured a cup of coffee and took a large swallow. It had been a late night. On Wednesday, the day after he was sworn in, the Athens Stock Exchange had plunged on concerns that the Syriza-led government might wage a battle with Greece\u2019s international creditors, and he had stayed up to monitor the developments.In his view, the markets, as well as leaders in some national capitals, overreacted to the perceived threat from Syriza. The party swept to power Sunday on promises to reject the belt-tightening policies \u2014 a condition of 240 billion euros, or about $272 billion in international bailout loans \u2014 that have stifled the Greek economy.\u201cPeople have described this as a Wild West showdown,\u201d he said, sighing in frustration, \u201cbut it is not a \u2018yes or no, take it or leave it\u2019 situation.\u201dSettling onto a couch, Mr. Varoufakis \u2014 a self-described \u201caccidental economist\u201d and \u201cerratic Marxist\u201d \u2014 sketched out what he said was the heart of the problem: Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable and austerity constituted \u201cfiscal waterboarding, where we are constantly having our head held under water.\"He said Greece wanted to negotiate with its creditors. But he insisted that Greece was not seeking a confrontation with creditors, whether in Frankfurt, Brussels or on Wall Street.\u201cAll we\u2019re asking is for,\u201d he said, \u201cis an opportunity to put together a proposal that will minimize the costs of Greece\u2019s loan agreement and give this country a chance to breathe again after policies that created massive social depravity.\u201dWhether Mr. Varoufakis can strike the delicate diplomatic balance that his task will require remains to be seen.Time is short. Even if the new government does not want to abide by the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout agreements, the Treasury would seem in need of a remaining \u20ac7 billion loan disbursement from that program if Greece is to pay off foreign debts coming due by August.But, Mr. Varoufakis said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want the \u20ac7 billion.\u201d\u201cWe want to sit down and rethink the whole program,\u201d he added. \u201cOur task is not to get the next loan tranche,\u201d which he said would be merely \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201dInstead, the task \u201cis to restructure the debt and the economy to get the money we need.\u201dWhen pressed to describe how Greece would pay for bonds falling due in the coming months without taking the \u20ac7 billion installment, Mr. Varoufakis replied, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about details.\u201dTo Syriza\u2019s detractors, such remarks might signal that the new government does not understand the magnitude of Greece\u2019s financial challenges. But Mr. Varoufakis suggested that the government could finance its obligations by reducing the target for the so-called primary surplus, the amount of cash in Greece\u2019s coffers after expenses and interest payments.Creditors are demanding that Greece run a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product. Mr. Varoufakis, however, said Athens would propose to hold the level to 1 percent to 1.5 percent of G.D.P.Greece is also counting on creditors to provide some form of debt relief, which would also free up funds. Much of the rest of Greece\u2019s total debt of \u20ac318 billion is in the form of loans from other European Union governments, which do not want a write-down that would cost their taxpayers. Mr. Varoufakis wants to begin discussions with other finance ministers to talk about ways of reducing that burden and said the government would soon issue proposals.Tall and magnetic, with a square jaw and a buzz-cut head, Mr. Varoufakis tends to speak in thoughtful and theatrical tones that can prompt strong reactions. He does not wear neckties, something avoided by the rest of the Syriza leadership. On Thursday he was dressed in jeans, a black felt jacket with the collar upturned and a maroon T-shirt, along with motorcycle boots that he said were essential to wear on the powerful Yamaha that he rides everywhere.Born in Athens, Mr. Varoufakis studied mathematical economics and statistics at Essex, England, where he obtained his doctoral degree in economics. His academic appointments included teaching economic theory and policy, political economics and philosophy and econometrics at the University of East Anglia, Cambridge, Glasgow and Sydney. He also studied game theory, which he put to use as an economist at the Valve Corporation, an American video game company. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Athens.Mr. Varoufakis is married to Danae Stratou, a Greek artist with whom he collaborated on a photographic survey of borders around the world, including the wall between the United States and Mexico and that between India and Pakistan. From previous relationships, Mr. Varoufakis has a daughter and Ms. Stratou has two children.In a 2013 paper titled \u201cConfessions of an Erratic Marxist in the Midst of a Repugnant European Crisis,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis argued that Europe\u2019s economic malaise was not just another cyclical slump but largely a structural problem based on a European Union that was \u201ca fundamentally anti-democratic, irrational cartel that has put Europe\u2019s peoples on a path to misanthropy, conflict and permanent recession.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one in officialdom in Europe that\u2019s remotely like him in terms of intellectual reach and depth,\u201d Mr. Galbraith, an economist and professor at the University of Texas, said in a telephone interview.On Thursday, Mr. Varoufakis vowed that Greece would not have a financial \u201caccident\u201d or be forced to exit the euro currency union. Although Greece should probably never have entered the euro union, he said, he likened it to the Eagles\u2019 song \u201cHotel California,\u201d saying, \u201cYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\u201d\u201cThere will be no new haircut of private sector debt,\u201d he said.As for whether Greece could grow its way out of debt, Mr. Varoufakis said growth needed to be addressed first at a Pan-European level.He called for a \u201cNew Deal\" investment-led recovery program around Europe. But he dismissed a plan proposed by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to invest \u20ac300 billion to stimulate growth on the Continent without adding to debt, calling it \u201ca public relations gimmick that has unfortunately occupied the minds of good people for too long \u2014 it will be a failure.\u201dMr. Varoufakis played down concerns about the health and safety of Greek banks, despite reports that billions of euros in deposits have been fleeing the country.\u201cWe expected that the first few days of our government, things would be turbulent,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the markets see that the proposals coming from this government are sensible, cooperative and therapeutic, we anticipate that share prices are going to\u201d recover.He also said Greece was not halting privatizations, despite remarks on Wednesday from another minister suggesting that this was the case. \u201cWe want to ensure that this country becomes an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, but not interested in a fire sale or selling the family silver,\u201d he said.\u201cI understand the fear in our partners\u2019 minds that if Greece is given an opportunity to reboot, we may go back to our bad old ways and end up where we were in 2009,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that we reassure them that we won\u2019t do that, because we don\u2019t want to do it ourselves.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Surprising Economic Trends in 2014, and What They Mean for 2015", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal MarketsIt was a confounding year in global financial markets. Not because it was a disaster for most investors; American stocks and bonds both rose in value. It was confounding because of some major moves that defied expert consensus this time a year ago \u2014 not only what was predicted, but what was even thought plausible.But by understanding what the biggest market moves were, you can also understand the forces that will shape the global economy in 2015.There was an epic collapse in oil prices.It\u2019s not that the price of oil has never moved as far and as fast as it did in 2014. It\u2019s just that usually when that happens, it occurs against the backdrop of much more global volatility, like in a worldwide recession at the end of 2008 and early 2009.What\u2019s remarkable about the roughly 50 percent decline in the price of oil in the second half of the year is that it occurred amid such stability; nothing radical changed in that time about either the global economic outlook or even the supply and demand picture for oil itself.Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off.We\u2019ve already started to see some of the geopolitical consequences of this shift, including the collapse in value of the ruble and new pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But that is probably only the beginning. The budgets of major oil producers, from Venezuela to Indonesia to Texas, will be stretched. Meanwhile, there will be a nice tailwind to growth around the world as cheaper fuel means higher real incomes for consumers.Long-term interest rates kept falling.That narrative was exactly right when it came to the economy and policy. The job market has strengthened, and the Fed has moved to end its interventions in the economy as planned. But the result for bond markets has been the opposite of the conventional wisdom.The yield on United States Treasury bonds fell significantly over the course of the year; the government can borrow money for 30 years for a mere 2.8 percent, down from 4 percent at the end of 2013. These lower costs have translated into cheaper home mortgages and lower borrowing costs for businesses, and higher bond prices (but lower future returns) for investors.Regardless of the cause, it raises the prospect that even as the economy continues to strengthen and the Fed raises rates in 2015, cheap longer-term rates will be here to stay.The U.S. stock market kept cruising.The stock market had a remarkable rally in 2013, and some were skeptical that it could continue the run in 2014.It did. But only in the United States.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 11.4 percent in 2014, not quite the 30 percent return of 2013 but not shabby by any measure. But while 2013 featured a broad rise among all the major global stock markets, the United States was a major outperformer in 2014.The core reason is that the American economy has performed better than its counterparts in much of the rest of the world, with Europe and Japan facing stagnant growth and emerging markets slowing their once-gangbuster pace. A related factor is that the dollar has appreciated compared with other currencies, so the dollars that American companies make are becoming relatively more valuable.Yet another year of stock prices that rise faster than corporate earnings certainly increases the risk of a sharp correction or a period of subpar returns. But in the meantime, Americans can take comfort in the fact that the referendum of global financial markets is that the United States will continue to be the driver of global economic recovery.The dollar soared.The same fundamentals that helped American stocks log another year of impressive returns drove up the dollar versus virtually all other major currencies \u2014 but a solid year for United States economic growth wasn\u2019t the entirety of the story.A schism has opened up between the Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to stimulate growth and fight deflation in their countries (the B.O.J. has already expanded its easing programs, and the E.C.B. appears on the verge of undertaking a form of bond-buying of its own). But the Fed has been signaling higher rates and tighter money.That has made the dollar more attractive, as has the sense that it is a beacon of economic strength in a troubled world economy. Those factors explain the 12 percent drop in the euro against the dollar and the 14 percent drop in the Japanese yen.But the strengthening dollar has implications for 2015 far beyond the finances of Americans thinking of visiting Paris this spring.If you are a company doing business in Mexico or South Korea, for example, and borrow money in dollars, a rising dollar makes repaying your debts more onerous and has the same effect as a hike in interest rates, potentially squeezing your cash flows or even leading to bankruptcy. Look for those ripple effects of a strong dollar across the globe in 2015.The outlook for inflation fell.Global investors are betting on very, very low inflation, for many years to come. That is the implication, anyway, of the relative prices of inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds in the United States and almost every other major economy.Part of this is easy to explain. The decline in oil and other commodity prices will put downward pressure on prices in 2015. But a broader shift in sentiment happened in recent months. Investors seem to think that very low inflation will persist even after the oil price declines of the last few months fully spread through other consumer prices. Bond prices currently imply that inflation from 2019 to 2024 will be 2.14 percent a year, down from 2.65 percent a year ago.Investor expectations suggest that the Fed may have more leeway than it had seemed a few months ago to keep interest rates low, especially if they see continued weakness in the economy.And given that similar trends are visible across the advanced world, it implies that one of the foremost challenges for policy is finding a way to get the world\u2019s major economies humming enough that deflation is no longer a concern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time to Assess Your Financial Fitness", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyWhen the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 for the first time late last month, you could practically hear the champagne corks popping. Traders wore hats celebrating the occasion, and email news alerts were followed by dutiful articles.If you found yourself cheering from the sidelines, however, you\u2019re in danger of using the wrong marker to track your own financial progress.There are many problems with the Dow. It tracks the stocks of just 30 of the largest American companies, which makes the S.&P. 500 a much better index. Both of those indexes ignore the goings-on at small companies and any firms based elsewhere. A balanced investment portfolio ought to have no more than about 20 percent of its money in large American stocks; once it does, the Dow ceases to be very useful as a proxy for one\u2019s own investment returns.Still, trying to keep score of your overall financial fitness is a fine idea. So here are some personal markers that you can turn to this year \u2014 and every year \u2014 when noise from the outside world may give you a mistaken impression of how you\u2019re actually doing.Check the numbers, though. The gain from 17,000 to 18,000 that happened during 2014 represented a not-particularly-exciting 5.9 percent increase. The move from 8,000 to 9,000 in 2009, just five years ago, was a 12.5 percent jump. As any index grows, a move from round number to round number will matter less.Most people don\u2019t save that much yet, and getting to that goal is hard. Try increasing savings by a percentage point or two each year, perhaps by devoting a big chunk of any salary raise to it if you can afford to.Save that money, however, and you might get a matching contribution from your employer if you haven\u2019t already maxed out the match in your workplace retirement savings plan. That could bring the $1,000 up to $1,500 or more on Day 1. Even if there\u2019s no match, you may get a tax deduction depending on how you save it, and decades of growth will allow the money to multiply.Look at it that way, and saving becomes a pretty good deal.But the unfortunate among us will become hurt or injured before retirement, and if it\u2019s bad enough we won\u2019t be able to work. How would we replace our incomes?People who are married could lean on their spouse, but would one income cover all of the family expenses plus any additional care for the newly disabled spouse? Single people might move in with family or hope for financial and other support from them or Social Security, but it\u2019s wise to ask relatives about this explicitly before making that assumption the foundation of worst-case planning.Aiming higher when it comes to saving is almost always a worthwhile goal. But building a safety net beneath you ought to be a higher priority in the new year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Have All the Cod Gone?", "Date": "2015-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s easy to imagine this recent drop in the cod population as a new phenomenon \u2014 a result, perhaps, of global warming, or some combination of climate change and overfishing by giant steel ships armed with electronic fish-finders and precise GPS navigation systems. And it\u2019s just as easy to imagine that, after a season or two of belt-tightening, fish populations will rebound \u2014 it is, after all, a strategy that state and federal regulators have pursued for decades.In fact, humans have been affecting the Atlantic\u2019s fish stocks for centuries, beginning with technology so simple that people today would not even consider it \u201ctechnology.\u201d Forgetting that history, we opt for short-term fixes, which only compound the problem.The fishery resources of the western Atlantic once seemed virtually limitless, with fish supposedly as numerous as grains of sand in the Sahara. And yet the current emergency effort to restore cod populations is simply the latest chapter in a 150-year saga in which fishermen, scientists, industrialists and politicians have consistently confronted emptier nets and fewer fish.As early as the 1850s, fishermen from Maine and Massachusetts began to pester their governments to do something about declining cod catches. Those men fished with hooks and lines from small wooden sailboats and rowboats. Fearing \u201cthe material injury of the codfishing interests of this state\u201d by increased fishing for menhaden, a critical forage fish for cod, fishermen from Gouldsboro, Me., implored the Legislature in 1857 to limit menhaden hauls.Yet annual cod landings in the Gulf of Maine continued to slide, from about 70,000 metric tons in 1861 to about 54,000 metric tons in 1880, to about 20,000 tons in the 1920s, to just a few thousand metric tons in recent years. There have been a few upticks along the way, such as one bumper year in the mid-1980s when the cod catch reached 25,000 tons (due, in part, to an unnecessarily large expansion of the fishing fleet), but for the most part the trend has been noticeably downward since the era of the Civil War. There have been plenty of warnings along the way. Maine\u2019s fishery commissioner, Edwin W. Gould, spoke out plainly in 1892. \u201cIt is the same old story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe buffalo is gone; the whale is disappearing; the seal fishery is threatened with destruction.\u201d For Mr. Gould, the path forward was clear: \u201cFish need protection.\u201dIn July 1914, after more than 40 years of reports on declining fishery resources by the United States Fish Commission and state fish commissions, The New York Times ran an article forecasting disaster. \u201cExtermination Threatens American Sea Fishes \u2014 Cost to Consumer Has Risen between 10 and 600 Per Cent Because of Decrease in Supply.\u201dBut that was right before a technological revolution in the fisheries. Sails and oars and hooks and lines were about to be replaced by steam and diesel engines, and massive nets dragged along the bottom that snared every fish in their path. Decades of well-founded concerns about depletion were overwhelmed by an avalanche of cheap fish. The new generation of draggers could fish faster, harder and deeper for the few fish that remained. Fishermen breathed a sigh of relief.Twentieth-century cod populations, ravaged by draggers\u2019 efficiency, declined further. In 1954 a fisheries economist from Boston charged fishing interests with continuing \u201cto exploit recklessly the limited self-renewing stocks of these species.\u201d That was just before the first factory-equipped freezer-trawler arrived at the prime fishing waters around the Grand Banks off Newfoundland from Europe. The size of an ocean liner, it could scoop up everything in its wake. Those ships made the steam-powered draggers from 1914 look positively quaint. And they caught lots of fish.Overfishing has been the norm for a very long time, but the market has masked the mess in two fundamental ways. At every step fishermen confronting declining catches developed gear that fished more intensively, taking a larger percentage of the fewer fish that remained. Such a strategy was clearly not sustainable. Meanwhile, fishermen continued to earn enough to make fishing worthwhile, even if many encouraged their sons to pursue other careers because there would be little future in fishing. The Gulf of Maine cod stocks today are probably only a fraction of 1 percent of what they were during George Washington\u2019s presidency.If there is any lesson in this story of large-scale, long-term environmental degradation, it is not that fishermen were (or are) to blame, or that scientists were (or are) to blame, or that politicians were (or are) to blame. The system was (and is) to blame. Our system of exploiting nature\u2019s resources, with its checks and balances, its desire for prosperity and security, its willingness to honor a multiplicity of voices, and its changing sense of \u201cnormal\u201d is insufficiently nimble to stop the desecration of commonly held resources on which the long-term good of everyone depends.The recent ban on cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine was an important step toward restoration, though clearly marine systems are very complex and subject to many variables. Considering that ban in light of history, however, is crucial. Historical perspectives provide a vital sense of scale for the sobering restoration challenges we face.The fisheries story, however, also provides a heading into the future, revealing as it does the tragic consequences of decision makers\u2019 unwillingness to steer a precautionary course in the face of environmental uncertainties. At every step of the way, decisions could have been made to exploit fish stocks more sustainably. That\u2019s a tale worth pondering.An Op-Ed article on Friday misstated the name of the agency that shut down cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine. It is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, not the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riding High, Biotech Firms Remain Wary", "Date": "2015-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The biotechnology industry tends to be overshadowed by the razzle-dazzle of high-tech companies like Apple, Facebook and Google, particularly in the Bay Area.Now, though, the biotech business is experiencing an almost unprecedented boom of its own. Money is flowing into the industry as never before. Stock prices are high, and drug approvals are up. And perhaps most important, some of the new drugs represent major advances against diseases like cancer, hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis. Buoyed by the recent success, some executives and investors are making the bold assertion that the industry has turned a corner and that improved scientific insights and new techniques are allowing drug developers to reduce their notoriously high failure rate and to take on some illnesses for the first time. Others are skeptical, saying that the current boom is a bubble that will burst. That mix of exuberance and anxiety characterized the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, the industry\u2019s most closely watched investor event, for which 9,000 executives and investors squeezed into the Westin St. Francis hotel here last week, navigating congested hallways and overflowing rooms to hear presentations from 400 companies over four days.But some executives still worried that share prices would fall and the flow of funding would slow. \u201cI have my seatbelt and crash helmet on,\u201d said the chief executive of a biotech company whose stock has tripled in price since last spring. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to affect his company\u2019s stock price by commenting publicly on the state of the industry.Biotechnology stocks have outperformed the overall market for several years. Last year the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose 35 percent compared with 11 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. One factor lifting stock prices is the frenzied pace at which small drug developers are being acquired by larger ones. That is in part spurred by the need for big pharmaceutical companies to replenish their pipelines as top-selling drugs go generic.Executives say new techniques for analyzing and manipulating genes and cells are leading to more insights about biology and innovative approaches to treatment. But others counter that drug development remains difficult, because human biology is extremely complex and largely unfathomable.Even if the science is improving, investors might still be bidding up stocks too much. \u201cThere are definitely areas and companies that seem to be ahead of themselves, for sure,\u201d said Misha Petkevich, portfolio manager at V2M Capital.Exhibit A, according to several investors and analysts, is the so-called CAR-T therapy, in which a cancer patient\u2019s immune system cells are genetically engineered to attack tumors. There have been some substantial successes in treating leukemia and lymphoma. But the technique is still early in development and can cause severe side effects. A setback in the development of CAR-T or other promising therapies could rapidly change sentiment. But the factor investors say could most curb enthusiasm is the increasing pressure from health plans and politicians to rein in what critics say are the exorbitant prices of drugs. That has set off a sort of price war as Gilead and AbbVie vie for the favor of other payers. Express Scripts next hopes to force such a face-off between two powerful new drugs for lowering cholesterol, which are expected to reach the market this year.The last time the biotech industry was so flush was around 2000, when companies promised, and investors believed, that genomics, particularly knowing the human DNA sequence, would revolutionize drug discovery. Stock prices eventually collapsed when genomics did not yield the promised bonanza. Some life science venture capitalists had such low returns that they effectively had to close up shop a few years ago. Exelixis laid off 70 percent of its staff last year after its best hope, a drug for prostate cancer, failed in a clinical trial. But techniques have improved, and there have been successes in various trials. So gene therapy has gone from pariah to rock star. \u201cI would never have predicted what\u2019s happened in the last 18 months,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. Still, he said, investors and companies were underestimating the challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bubble, and gene therapy is at the center of it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne learns humility. That\u2019s what I learned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Spending on hotels, meals and taxis will be cheaper since dollars have greater spending power in the 19 countries where the euro is the official currency.\u201cThis is great for tourists, as Europe is getting cheaper by the day,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cBut don\u2019t buy euros now \u2014 wait for the trip. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if the euro was even with the dollar by April.\u201dOn Thursday, the euro dropped by more than 2 percent against the dollar, to just below $1.14. Many analysts say they expect the euro to continue falling, possibly reaching parity with the dollar in the coming months.As for stocks, added liquidity in global markets tends to benefit equity prices broadly, even if the stimulus is not coming from the Federal Reserve this time around. For example, Wall Street rallied in the fall after Japan\u2019s central bank expanded its asset purchasing program in late October.And some of the euros pumped into the economy by the European Central Bank will find their way to Wall Street. On Thursday, traders cheered the announcement by policy makers in Frankfurt, with broad market averages in the United States rising by more than 1.5 percent.\u201cThere has been a debate about whether other central banks can substitute for the U.S. in terms of liquidity, and the answer today seems to be yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combination of the Bank of Japan and the E.C.B. should at least compensate for the Fed, and maybe add more.\u201dAs for the broader American economy, most economists said the overall impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s move on these shores is likely to be muted.For example, in 2013, total, global American exports of $3.2 trillion contributed 13.4 percent to G.D.P. Of that $3.2 trillion, less than a quarter went to the eurozone, according to Commerce Department data. Anything but a dramatic surge in European demand would be felt only slightly in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s modestly negative, but rounding-size-error negative in terms of growth, maybe one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d Mr. Hanson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.Some European imports, such as luxury goods, could conceivably fall in price, although discounts for high-end fashion and watches tend to be rarer than for mass-market goods. And some European automakers now produce many their cars in the United States, further reducing any currency benefit for car buyers.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, echoed Mr. Hanson\u2019s view that the big picture for the American economy, which has been rosier as of late, is unlikely to be dimmed by any fallout from Europe.He estimates the American economy grew at an annual rate of just over 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, with growth over the course of 2015 coming at just under 3 percent. A large portion of those gains will come from healthier spending by American consumers who are benefiting from the plunge in energy prices.\u201cNobody\u2019s growth outlook for the U.S. will change after what happened today,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cWhatever drove your forecast before is still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiss Franc Soars After Central Bank Drops Cap", "Date": "2015-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Switzerland stunned the markets on Thursday by abandoning a crucial part of its effort to hold down the value of its currency, concluding that the strategy was too risky and too costly given the enormous forces pushing in the other direction. The move underscores the turbulent state of the global economy. Around the world, smaller economies are grappling with how to navigate the aggressive monetary activism of major central banks like the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank.The Swiss central bank had been trying to cap the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, with nervous investors fleeing the market tumult and seeking the relative safety of Switzerland. But the euro\u2019s decline has been particularly steep \u2014 and the rout may accelerate.The European Central Bank is expected to announce a major new stimulus program next week to pump money into the region\u2019s troubled economy, which is creating downward pressure on the euro. That pressure is particularly marked against the dollar, which is rising in part because of a strong United States economy and plans by the Fed to raise interest rates.If the Europeans undertake such an effort, it would make it that much more expensive for the Swiss to buy enough euros to maintain the value of the franc. So the Swiss leaders\u2019 abandonment of its target was taken as a bet that easier money from the European Central Bank is on the way, and potentially on a vast scale.\u201cRecently, divergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas have increased significantly \u2014 a trend that is likely to become even more pronounced,\u201d the Swiss central bank said in the announcement.The abrupt decision on Thursday sent the value of the Swiss franc soaring, as the country\u2019s stocks broadly plummeted. The shares of exporters, in particular, got slammed over fears that the rising currency would weigh on profit.\u201cWords fail me!\u201d Nick Hayek, the chief executive of the Swiss watchmaker the Swatch Group, said in a statement distributed to news media, adding that today\u2019s action \u201cis a tsunami: for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.\u201dAs panic set in, investors and savers dumped euros in favor of the Swiss franc and other safe havens. The rising value of the Swiss franc, however, could contribute to pushing the country into deflation and create problems for the country\u2019s exporters, which suddenly found their products less competitive overseas. Switzerland\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on such companies.The Swiss central bank\u2019s strategy, which involves selling francs on the open market in exchange for euros, has been controversial at home. Many exporters had welcomed the decision to hold down the franc.But as the central bank\u2019s balance sheet grew by several hundred billion euros, the central bank came under fire from opponents. In a December referendum, those critics tried to force the central bank to convert much of its foreign exchange holdings into gold. That initiative failed.\u201cThis exceptional and temporary measure protected the Swiss economy from serious harm,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. \u201cWhile the Swiss franc is still high, the overvaluation has decreased as a whole since the introduction of the minimum exchange rate. The economy was able to take advantage of this phase to adjust to the new situation.\u201dPhyllis Papadavid, foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London, said after the Swiss central bank action that monetary authorities were \u201cstill sensitive\u201d to the overvaluation of the franc, but that they had adapted to changed conditions \u2014 particularly the dollar\u2019s recent rise \u2014 by changing course.\u201cThey haven\u2019t given up,\u201d Ms. Papadavid said. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly going to continue watching it.\u201dAs it scrapped the cap, the Swiss central bank simultaneously cut interest rates, already in negative terrain, hoping to offset some of the damage in foreign exchange markets. It changed the rate on deposits to minus 0.75 percent from minus 0.25 percent, tripling what it costs lenders to park money at the central bank.But that was too little to stop the tide, and the franc jolted 15 percent higher against the euro. Swiss stocks plummeted in value as investors hastened to sell equities priced in francs.Shares of Swatch, the global watch brand, fell 16 percent, leading the Swiss Market Index nearly 9 percent lower. But the decline was broad-based, including Nestl\u00e9, the food manufacturer; Holcim, the giant cement maker; and the chemical company Syngenta.\u201cWe can only guess at what was in their minds,\u201d Carl B. Weinberg, chief global economist at High Frequency Economics, said of the Swiss central bank\u2019s move. \u201cMaybe they are afraid that the euro is coming on some hard times, and they didn\u2019t want to be tied to a sinking ship.\u201dMr. Weinberg said it was hard at the moment to tell what the fallout would ultimately be, but that it would mainly be \u201cmicro effects, rather than macro effects.\u201d\u201cA lot of people were borrowing in Swiss francs because they were cheap,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said. \u201cWell, anyone who borrowed in francs now owes something like 15 percent more than they did yesterday.\u201d\u201cBut anyone who has Swiss assets is a little bit richer today,\u201d he added. \u201cNet, there are winners and losers.\u201dDavid Jolly reported from Paris and Neil Irwin from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tsipras\u2019s Debt Plan Sends Athens Stock Market Sliding", "Date": "2015-01-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Investors made clear on Wednesday the depth of their concerns about Greece\u2019s new leftist-led government, driving up its borrowing costs, pushing down stock prices and highlighting the risks in the country\u2019s banking system.Later, the new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, appeared to harden the tone, saying that Greece\u2019s bailout deals were \u201ca toxic mistake\u201d and that the new government was determined to change the logic of how the crisis had been tackled. Mr. Varoufakis said the new government would seek what he called a Pan-European New Deal, which would be a bridge between previous agreements and a new arrangement with creditors. He did not elaborate, though, on what such a plan would look like.The White House confirmed that Mr. Tsipras spoke by telephone on Wednesday with President Obama, who has generally been critical of Europe's austerity approach and supportive of more growth-oriented policies. But Mr. Obama has also recognized the need for structural reforms to accompany growth policies.The White House would describe the telephone conversation only in general terms. But a spokesman made clear that Mr. Obama favored a balanced strategy.\u201cThe United States looks forward to working closely with the new Greek government to build on recent structural reforms, which lay the groundwork for economic recovery,\u201d Mark Stroh, a White House spokesman, said in a written statement. \u201cWe will also continue to discuss ways to boost demand and job creation with our European partners to help foster an environment that supports reforms in Greece and elsewhere in Europe.\u201dWhile many Greeks were hopeful that Mr. Tsipras would follow through with even a fraction of his populist promises, investors were rattled. The Athens Stock Exchange, where billions of euros in value were wiped out during Greece\u2019s election campaign, fell 9.2 percent on Wednesday after slumping around 11 percent on Tuesday. Shares in banks in Greece plummeted nearly 27 percent on Wednesday.The yield on Greek 10-year government bonds spiked on Wednesday to about 10.1 percent, up from 9.25 percent when the day began, on investor unease over a possible debt restructuring. The yields were at 8.4 percent before the election and below 6 percent for most of the summer, as the Greek economy appeared poised to grow again under the prime minister at the time, Antonis Samaras.If bond yields, indicative of the new government\u2019s borrowing costs, remained at such elevated levels, that would make it even harder to stimulate the economy and manage the country\u2019s debt.European Union officials also outlined a tough-sounding position on Wednesday before what would no doubt be long negotiations over the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout and an effort by the new government to reduce the country\u2019s mountain of debt.Since 2010, the so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 has extended Greece two bailouts worth \u20ac240 billion, or about $270 billion.A vice president of the European Commission, Jyrki Katainen, said on Wednesday that Brussels was eager to start talks with Greece. But noting that he saw no majority in favor of writing off any Greek debt, he added: \u201cWe expect them to fulfill everything that they have promised to fulfill.\u201dHe emphasized that Brussels could not simply look at the popular anti-austerity excitement surrounding the Greek elections, but that he had to take into account the wishes of people in other countries, including Finns and Germans who were not inclined to give Greece a penny more. \u201cWe don\u2019t change our policy according to elections,\u201d he said.Mr. Katainen\u2019s remarks suggested Brussels\u2019s opening bargaining position, and they did not necessarily mean that European officials would not offer concessions. But they put the heat on Athens, especially since there is not much time to reach a deal: Greece\u2019s current European bailout, already extended, ends in late February unless there is another extension.\u201cWe need to start working together very soon because the commitments have not changed and time is running out,\u201d Mr. Katainen told reporters.Asked whether Greece would be able to persuade creditors to write off some of its debt, Mr. Katainen said he thought that this was a nonstarter, at least in the Eurogroup, a grouping of finance ministers from the 19 countries, including Greece, that use the euro.\u201cIt would be difficult to see that there would be a majority in the Eurogroup supporting a haircut in Greek debt,\u201d said Mr. Katainen, a former prime minister of Finland, which has strongly supported Germany in demanding that Athens pay its bills.In the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Tsipras set out his government\u2019s top priorities in order: tackling what he called the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis, stimulating the economy so it could start growing sustainably, entering into a new negotiation with creditors aimed at finding a \u201cmutually beneficial solution to the debt,\u201d creating a \u201cfairer\u201d tax system, and confronting vested interests and corruption \u201cthat no one has had the guts to go against.\u201dHe also vowed to end what he called a regime of cronyism, in which past governments would \u201cnegotiate with the rich, but not to the benefit of the poor.\u201dMr. Tsipras and Mr. Varoufakis plan to meet with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of European Union finance ministers, in Athens on Friday. This week, Mr. Dijsselbloem warned that there was \u201cvery little support for a write-off\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts. Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, is also scheduled to visit Mr. Tsipras this week in Athens.The market gyrations, driven by investors\u2019 bailing out of Greek assets, reflect fears over the coming showdown over Europe\u2019s austerity ideology. If Greece exited the eurozone and reintroduced the drachma currency \u2014 something Mr. Tsipras says he has no intention of bringing about \u2014 many of the Greek investments held by foreigners would plunge in value when the new currency was introduced at a sharp discount to the euro.Speculation is rife that capital flight has increased significantly since then. Greek officials said they did not immediately have new figures, and declined to comment on whether those emergency funds had been tapped.William Lelieveldt, a central bank spokesman, said only that \u201cwe don\u2019t provide real-time information on which kind of liquidity is requested or drawn.\u201dStill, the sell-off, while drastic, was not far out of line with the kind of volatility that has characterized the Athens financial markets since the onset of the country\u2019s crisis in 2010. Indeed, investors now tend to treat Greece more like a developing country than a member of the developed world. That volatility could die down as quickly as it arose should a suitable solution be found.The most likely outcome, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, is that \u201cfacing reality, Prime Minister Tsipras will eventually get real.\u201d\u201cA patient Europe will offer face-saving compromises,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Schmieding said in a research note, that in the meantime there could \u201cbe a rough ride for Greece.\u201d And he warned that the odds of an \u201caccidental\u201d Greek exit from the eurozone, at 35 percent, were not insignificant.Adding to the uncertainty was a report that Mr. Tsipras had basically frozen Greece\u2019s privatization program, which had been a central demand of creditors in approving the country\u2019s international bailouts. The troika had expected Greece to raise tens of billions of euros to pay its debts by privatizing state assets.But the country\u2019s new energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, told Greek television that the government was immediately halting plans to privatize a public power company. It was also delaying the sale of a portion of Piraeus Port, one of the most strategically placed in the Mediterranean, to the Chinese state-owned company Cosco, which already owns half of Piraeus and had recently signed an agreement to start expanding cargo capacity on the other half of the port.Mr. Tsipras said he was well aware of the high expectations for him in Greece, and the heavy responsibility his government shouldered. He suggested that the rousing messages of support he had received from leaders in numerous countries, from Russia to France to Spain, signaled that compromise was possible.\u201cThe country is lifting up its head, assuming global significance, attracting international interest,\u201d he added. \u201cGreece is regaining its self-confidence and building alliances that will allow it to set its own agenda at the European table.\u201d\u201cWe have no time to delay,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no room for mistakes.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day the interest rate on Greek 10-year government bonds increased nearly 1 percent. It was Wednesday, not Thursday.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Brussels, David Jolly from Paris, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Strategies for Resolution Breakers", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfTHE problem with most New Year\u2019s resolutions is that they aren\u2019t any fun. Sure, many of us should eat less \u2014 and healthier. And of course, more exercise would be a good thing. But actually doing these things can be hard.It\u2019s no different with financial resolutions. Spending less and saving more is a wonderful concept. But it would be much more enjoyable to take a big vacation in Bora Bora \u2014 and to lie on a hammock and consume high-calorie food and drink once we\u2019re there.The authors of two new personal-finance books sympathize. They know it\u2019s tough to achieve your financial goals unless you can somehow transform the flat, boring numbers in your savings and retirement accounts into something that has meaning.In \u201cPicture Your Prosperity,\u201d there isn\u2019t much financial advice \u2014 and that is by design. There are only a handful of pages devoted to such things as asset allocation. And while the authors say that one of the three model portfolios they offer will fit your risk tolerance, the options are all conservative.For example, the most aggressive one, which they liken to a sports car, has just 70 percent of its holdings in stock \u2014 with 20 percent in bonds and an additional 5 percent each in real estate and commodities. That\u2019s more like a Honda Accord with a spoiler than a Lamborghini.And when it comes to saving strategies, the authors don\u2019t go much deeper than saying you should pay off your credit card every month and make sure you\u2019re actually using that gym membership you bought.So what fills the rest of this 272-page book? A relentlessly upbeat tone that says in countless variations, \u201cYes, we know investing is challenging, but you can do it,\u201d and an urging to picture your desired financial future. To help you create that image, the authors provide 32 small color photographs \u2014 of things like an airplane, which can represent travel, and an artist\u2019s palette to symbolize avocations you might want to pursue.Once you create that picture, \u201cplease don\u2019t put it in your sock drawer,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe get that you probably won\u2019t display it above your sofa, but it should be somewhere you can see it every day.\u201d A constant reminder of what you are saving for will help keep you focused and committed to your goal, the authors write, as will periodic checks on your progress. If your goal is to completely pay for your child\u2019s college education, for example, yet you aren\u2019t putting very much money toward it, something is out of whack.WHILE the book offers very good advice about how you can visualize your financial goals, achieving them will take more help than it provides. That\u2019s where Mr. Robbins could come in.If anything, his 656-page book contains even more exhortations. (\u201cRemember, it\u2019s not conditions but decisions that determine our lives.\u201d) And he acknowledges that he consulted with financial experts like John C. Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group, and the hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II in formulating his advice.The results are a distillation of just about every good personal-finance idea of the last 40 years. Mr. Robbins passionately advocates diversification, buying index funds to keep investment expenses low and increasing the percentage you save every time you get a raise.Here\u2019s my interpretation of that: Say you make $100,000 annually and are saving 10 percent. If you get a $5,000 raise, instead of putting away $10,500, you might increase your savings rate to 12 percent, or $12,600. Another $5,000 raise two years from now? Increase the rate to 14 percent and save $15,400. \u201cIt\u2019s painless,\u201d Mr. Robbins writes, because the higher savings rate is more than offset by the size of your raise.All of this is good, but the book has three flaws.It often repeats itself, and at length. For example, the idea of increasing your savings percentage with each raise is discussed in four separate places. Mr. Robbins says the repetition is intended to underscore important points. But it\u2019s annoying.Also, his \u201call seasons\u201d portfolio, with just 30 percent of its holdings in equities and 55 percent in bonds \u2014 the rest in gold and other commodities \u2014 is intended to serve investors in both up and down markets. Yet it seems extremely conservative, especially given today\u2019s low bond yields.And the problem with providing constantly supportive messages is that it can make reaching goals appear easier than it is. For example, Mr. Robbins correctly points out that prepaying your mortgage lets you own your home faster. His suggestion: \u201cNext time you write your monthly mortgage check, write a second check for the principal-only portion of next month\u2019s payment.\u201dComing up with that additional money isn\u2019t easy for many people, though for Mr. Robbins it evidently is. He writes about (and plugs) the resort he owns in Fiji and discusses how he moved to Florida when California raised its state income tax to a point where he felt \u201cno longer welcome.\u201dA vast majority of us are not in his situation. But then again, it may give us something to aspire to. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, That Other Shoe Still Didn\u2019t Drop ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBONDS confounded conventional wisdom in 2014 with a much-better-than-expected return.Yet the bellwether Treasury note ended 2014 at 2.17 percent after starting it at 3 percent. And while the United States economy showed some vigor \u2014 typically a trigger for rates to rise \u2014 global investors fleeing weakness in other markets were eager to buy American bonds. That demand pushed bond prices higher and yields lower.The upshot is that last year was frustrating only for the bond bears who have been waiting since 2009 for interest rates to rise from the abnormally low levels manufactured by Federal Reserve policy.Morningstar\u2019s index of intermediate-term core bond funds \u2014 the high-quality portfolios that are the heart of most retirement plans \u2014 had a total return of more than 5 percent in 2014. Total return is the sum of the income (the yield) the fund earned and any changes in the underlying price of bonds in the portfolio. The five-year annualized gain of 4.8 percent for the index of core bond funds was also anything but bad news.Yet if you\u2019ve followed the predictions of many bond experts since Fed policy pushed interest rates low during the financial crisis, you might think that core bond funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 especially those that closely mimic the look and feel of the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index \u2014 are supposedly ill-equipped for today\u2019s world.A common warning is that core bond funds, with an average duration of more than five years, will suffer bigger price declines than funds with shorter durations. Duration is a measure of a fund\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates; when rates rise, a fund with a longer duration will have steeper price declines than one with a shorter duration. That\u2019s absolutely true. But hiding out in short-term bond funds with their lower yields has its own opportunity cost. The 2.3 percent average annualized gain for playing it safe in short-term bonds over the last five years was less than half the return of core bond funds.And if history is any guide, even when rates do rise, the higher income payouts from a core bond portfolio offset the price declines over time. From the end of 1948, when an intermediate-term government bond yielded just 1.5 percent, to the end of 1981, when it almost reached 14 percent, the annualized total return was still around 4 percent, according to data from Ibbotson Associates, a unit of Morningstar.Another common criticism of high-quality bond funds is that they are heavily invested in areas of the market that are now the most expensive: United States Treasuries and government-backed mortgage bonds. But that conversation often doesn\u2019t mention that high-quality bonds are best equipped to provide risk-damping diversification when stocks plunge.\u201cBonds have been like a high-scoring basketball player, riding the long decline in rates, and that\u2019s what everyone focuses on,\u201d says Craig Israelsen, who teaches in the financial planning program at Utah Valley University.Over the very long haul \u2014 from 1981 through 2013 \u2014 the average intermediate-term government bond had an annualized gain of 8 percent, according to Ibbotson data. That sort of performance may be off the table now that rates have little room to move lower. But what remains intact is the ability of high-quality bonds to do well when stocks swoon.Defense could be especially valuable right now.And don\u2019t expect the new breed of bond funds that flaunt a go-anywhere approach in pursuit of yield and returns to provide the same downside protection. According to Morningstar, these funds, on average, have about one-third of their assets invested in bonds rated below investment grade, also known as high-yield or junk bonds. Such bonds tend to move more in sync with stocks than with Treasuries; in 2008, an index of high-yield bonds lost more than 26 percent.\u201cWhen equities are going down, unconstrained bond funds may not provide traditional diversification,\u201d said Mr. Kane at TCW.The average high-grade intermediate-term bond fund has less than 6 percent of its assets invested in lower-quality bonds. Funds and E.T.F.s that track the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index do not invest in bonds rated below investment grade.This doesn\u2019t make go-anywhere funds a bad choice. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of having eyes wide open to the credit risk you are taking on,\u201d said Mr. Davis at Vanguard.\u201cThose are the bonds the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program focused on and has driven to very expensive levels,\u201d Mr. Ivascyn said.They are finding better values in mortgage-backed bonds that lack a government guarantee. Mr. Ivascyn said such bonds would have more volatility than government bonds but were less risky than traditional junk bonds. He expects these nonagency mortgage bonds to deliver returns of around 5 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s double what the 10-year Treasury pays.\u201dOCCUPYING a middle ground between high-grade, index-tracking bond funds and the go-anywhere crowd are actively managed funds, with a limited mandate to venture beyond the types of bonds tracked by the Barclays aggregate index. The ability to deviate from the index has proved effective recently: According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, nearly 60 percent of core bond funds managed to outperform the index over the five years through June 2014.\u201cIt comes down to deciding what you want from bonds,\u201d said Mr. Israelsen at Utah Valley University. \u201cIf you value diversification, you should stick with classic high-grade funds. If you want higher yield and returns, just understand what you\u2019re buying into.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stimulus for Eurozone, but It May Be Too Little or Too Late", "Date": "2015-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilThe European Central Bank unleashed a surprisingly aggressive stimulus plan on Thursday that looked like the last, best hope to prevent the region from sliding toward another lost economic decade with the stagnant growth, high unemployment and political strains that it would mean.But the 1.1 trillion-euro question is whether the bond-buying program will jolt Europe out of its economic doldrums or merely create a short-term lift to financial markets. The flood of new money sloshing around the global economy could also create problems elsewhere.\u201cThe E.C.B. will succeed in weakening the euro and maintaining generally low interest rates,\u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz. \u201cBut this is insufficient to deliver a growth breakthrough,\u201d he added, and \u201ccomes with the risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences.\u201dSince the financial crisis in 2008, nations grappling with economic weakness have repeatedly turned to one tool to try to fix things: the power of their central banks to create new money from thin air and push it into the financial system by buying bonds. Such programs, known as quantitative easing, can help lower long-term interest rates and bolster financial markets, encouraging spending and business investment.The program was bigger than analysts had expected, and the initial market reaction was favorable. Stocks jumped worldwide, and borrowing costs fell, particularly in Europe. The value of the euro \u2014 already dropping precipitously in recent months in anticipation of the move on Thursday \u2014 dropped an additional 2 percent against the dollar to its lowest level since 2003. That should help the E.C.B\u2019s goal of increasing eurozone inflation, and help make the Continent\u2019s exporters more competitive.The success or failure of the program, though, depends on much more than one day\u2019s market moves. And the mixed record of monetary injections elsewhere show the challenges that Mr. Draghi and his colleagues will have turning their fiscal activism into sustained economic improvement. The American and British efforts are generally considered successful, but Japan is struggling with a weak economy and deflation.Mr. Draghi acknowledged that it would take more than an open spigot of money from the central bank to get Europe\u2019s economy on track, and that political authorities across Europe must act as well. \u201cWhat monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth,\u201d he said at a news conference in Frankfurt. \u201cBut for growth to pick up, you need investment. For investment, you need confidence. And for confidence, you need structural reforms.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s now up to the governments to implement these structural reforms,\u201d he said.Then there are the broader risks of such aggressive monetary activism, as trillions of new dollars, pounds and yen have created unpredictable ripple effects worldwide. Even before Europe announced its plans, risks started to surface.Switzerland\u2019s central bank last week abandoned a longstanding peg of the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, concluding that it would be impossible to maintain amid the anticipated E.C.B. action. After dropping the cap, the value of the franc rose 17 percent in a single day, and a Swiss recession may well result.Also Thursday, the Danish central bank cut interest rates, as it faces the challenge of maintaining its own peg between the krone and the euro. It is the country\u2019s second rate cut in a week.Going in the opposite direction, the Federal Reserve is withdrawing its extraordinary stimulus from the United States, helping to drive up the value of the dollar on global currency markets. That could make for more challenging times for American exporters and companies and banks in emerging markets that have borrowed extensively in dollars.Even as the ripples from years of monetary intervention spread through the globe, the biggest uncertainty for Europe is whether the new program will be enough to arrest a slide toward deflation. Analysts have been reluctant to predict too much out of the new program.\u201cQ.E. is not a silver bullet for the eurozone\u2019s many problems,\u201d Howard Archer, the chief European economist for IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note. \u201cBut it should provide some limited help to growth by adding to the stimulus that is already coming from very low oil prices and the markedly weaker euro.\u201dAt first glance, Mr. Draghi\u2019s plan emulates the Federal Reserve\u2019s third and final round of quantitative easing, which is generally credited with helping to accelerate the American economy over the last two years. Both programs were open-ended in size, with billions in monthly bond purchases paired with a pledge to continue until some goal was met. (For the Fed, it was substantial improvement in the job market. For the European Central Bank, returning inflation toward its target).There are two big differences.First, the E.C.B. is late. When the Fed pulled the trigger on its open-ended bond buying, in September 2012, annual inflation was running at 1.6 percent in the United States, not far below its 2 percent target. The economy was growing at a steady if unexceptional rate. The Fed was looking to get ahead of its problem of sluggish growth.The European Central Bank, by contrast, has begun a series of half-measures over the last two and a half years. The contrast has its roots in differing economic analysis about the dangers of deflation and political factors, in particular the aversion of Europe\u2019s central bankers and German political leaders to use the common central bank to share risk among countries.The second big difference with the American program is that the E.C.B. is moving only partway in distributing the risk of losses across the countries that use the euro.The European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt, administers its policies through national central banks across the eurozone: the Bundesbank in Germany, the Banca d\u2019Italia in Italy, and so on. One debate Mr. Draghi and his colleagues had to resolve was whether any losses from government defaults or restructurings on bonds bought through this program would be borne by Europe as a whole or the specific national bank that bought the bonds.Mr. Draghi was dismissive of the importance of this so-called risk mutualization debate in his news conference Thursday. But the plan he unveiled showed the hallmarks of an intricate negotiation to have some elements of risk-sharing and some risk remaining on the books of individual national banks.Mr. Draghi showed guile and savvy in guiding a fractious committee of central bankers to a bigger and more aggressive program than seemed plausible even a few weeks ago. But those compromises, if they are too significant, may undermine his goals, failing to shock decision makers across Europe into a belief that it is riskier to hoard money than to spend and invest it.\u201cI am not sure this is a game changer,\u201d Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cMonetary policy in itself is one ingredient, not the ultimate solution.\u201dPeter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For U.S. Stocks, at Least, a Solid Finish", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks ended the fourth quarter of 2014 near record highs, but they traveled a circuitous route to get there \u2014 falling, then soaring, then falling again before making a strong late run. Bonds went in either direction, depending on the quality of the vehicle used for the trip. And in the quarter\u2019s biggest surprise, oil headed due south.Crude oil prices plunged 41.4 percent for the quarter, to end the year at a five-year low after several large producers, first Saudi Arabia and then other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, indicated that they had no intention of curbing production to prop up prices. The move was a reminder of how powerful market forces and the law of supply and demand can be.The Econ 101 refresher course was well timed, nearly coinciding with another significant event: The Federal Reserve signaled to the markets that it would wean them off the stimulus that had helped support them for several years. The central bank suspended its program of bond purchases, or quantitative easing, in October and hinted last month that it would let short-term interest rates rise by midyear.The stock market took the policy changes and oil price decline in stride. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished 2014 at 2,058.90, up 4.4 percent for the quarter and 11.4 percent for the year.The rally helped the average domestic stock fund tracked by Morningstar to rise 4.3 percent in the quarter, but most other broad stock fund categories declined. The average international stock fund fell 2 percent, pulled down by losses of 2.7 percent for portfolios that focus on Europe and 2.3 percent for Asia funds. Diversified emerging-market funds were down 4.9 percent, on average. The declines were attributable partly to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of assets denominated in other currencies. Foreign stock markets did not perform well enough to make up for the weakness in other currencies.Domestic funds were more the exception than the rule for another reason: The United States is seen to stand apart when it comes to economic progress and central bank policies. The American economy has displayed unusual strength, including an upward revision of third-quarter economic growth to a 5 percent annual rate, and the Fed is looking to tighten credit.Japanese and Chinese authorities, by contrast, responded to persistent sluggishness by accelerating bond purchase programs in the fourth quarter or by taking other extraordinary measures. The European Central Bank is expected to follow suit, since the region\u2019s economy remains weak.The United States may be strong enough to support the global economy, some investment advisers say. But it\u2019s also possible that other regions may be so weak that they will drag down the American economy with them.Investors trying to determine which way things will break will receive little guidance from the sharp drop in oil prices, Mr. Inker added. It\u2019s a portentous event for the global economy, but it\u2019s hard to know what it portends.Cheaper oil \u201chas got to be a good thing, net, for most of the developed world and a fair chunk of the emerging world,\u201d he said. But if the decline hints at a deceleration of growth and broader deflation, he warned, \u201cwe\u2019re going to look back and say that the global economy came unstuck in the second half of 2014, but we didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d\u201cWith the U.S. economy still healthy and the eurozone and Japan likely to exceed low economic expectations,\u201d Mr. Baur said, \u201cwe\u2019d suggest overweighting each area\u2019s equities in one\u2019s global portfolio and underweighting the rest of the world.\u201d That would mean emerging markets, which he warned \u201cface significant headwinds in 2015 with tighter Fed policy, a stronger dollar, a slower-growing Chinese economy and local financial stress and squeezed profits.\u201dHis outlook isn\u2019t ideal for the United States, either, in the short run. American stocks could suffer a 15 percent correction early in the year as investors adjust to a less generous Fed, he warned, before bouncing back to end 2015 with a net return in the high single digits.\u201cWe\u2019re still overweight the U.S., with the bulk of exposure in large-capitalization stocks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the dollar rally is over, and to the degree that you get a rally in Europe, you\u2019re going to lose out on the currency. The surprise in 2015 might be not more dollar strength but the degree of dollar strength.\u201d\u201cAbenomics has been a miracle for the corporate sector,\u201d Mr. Vail said. \u201cTaxes have been cut, and profit margins\u201d are rising rapidly, \u201chigher than in 1988.\u201dThe resurgence may have escaped notice because the yen\u2019s decline has limited the rise in Japanese stock prices when expressed in dollars, but Mr. Vail expects the exchange rate to stabilize while profits and stocks will keep rising, creating a sweet spot for investors.Asian stocks in general \u201chave a greater deal to offer\u201d than American ones, as Mr. Vail sees it. He says South Korea, in particular, is \u201cmoving in the right direction.\u201d \u201cI said there wouldn\u2019t be an increase in interest rates in 2014 when the consensus was that the Fed would hike, and they won\u2019t hike this year, either,\u201d he predicted.To show why it won\u2019t need or want to, he highlighted extremely low government bond yields worldwide, which imply that investors foresee almost no inflation for several years. He also pointed to recent weakness in the junk-bond market as a warning for the global economy. Yields have risen on the debt of riskier issuers, especially energy companies suddenly facing lower revenue. \u201cIf we have a series of defaults in the energy sector, there could be spillover effects elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said.Fourth-quarter fund results indicate a flight to safety by bond investors. Funds that hold long-term government issues rose a robust 8.8 percent, but declines in high-yield and emerging-market portfolios left the average bond fund nursing a loss of 0.1 percent.European government bond yields could continue to fall if the European Central Bank picks up where the Fed left off and introduces a bond-purchasing program early this year.\u201cThe eurozone requires a weaker euro for many countries to regain competitiveness, so the E.C.B. is going to start purchasing sovereign paper in the first quarter,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cThere should be one more burst of yield decline.\u201dThe Greek Parliament was dissolved in late December after the ruling party lost a crucial vote. That party backs the austerity program introduced in 2012 as a condition for the debt bailout that kept the country in the eurozone. A general election will be held on Jan. 25, with voters expected to back a coalition led by a party that wants to renegotiate the bailout terms, something that Germany and other large European Union members would probably resist.\u201cThis could get kind of scary,\u201d Mr. Inker said. \u201cFringe parties are getting significant support throughout Europe. If they kick out the elites, it\u2019s not clear what happens.\u201dWhatever impact central bank policies have on the real world, they have worked wonders for the markets. Mr. Sri-Kumar questioned how much more bang the bankers could get for their trillions of bucks.\u201cThey\u2019ve carried the distortion as far as it can go,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks may lose the ability to keep postponing the inevitable through increasing the money supply. If we had normal interest rates, stock and bond prices wouldn\u2019t be where they are.\u201dHe encourages staying in United States Treasury bonds, which he expects to rally, with 10-year yields falling to 1.75 percent from their year-end level of 2.17 percent. European government debt should do well too, in his opinion, but American investors could lose money if the euro continues to drop. As for stocks, he would stick to the safest sectors, including consumer staples, utilities and health care.Mr. Inker agreed that investors should be \u201csomewhat more conservatively positioned than normal.\u201d With American stock and bond prices so high, that means looking abroad, especially to the developing world. But he acknowledged a conundrum: While foreign markets are cheaper, their economies appear more fragile, so it\u2019s hard to know which direction to take.\u201cYou can either have scary stuff that\u2019s cheap,\u201d he said, \u201cor stuff that allows you to sleep at night but where it\u2019s hard to see how you\u2019ll get much return on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Target-Date Funds Can Pose Complexities", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Hebrew SeniorLife, a nonprofit organization providing housing and health care for the elderly, about 30 percent of the assets in its retirement plan are invested in such funds. Ms. Lemmerman also invests in target-date funds herself. The reason for this popularity? Simplicity, she said. Employees just pick a fund based on their expected retirement year; typically, the funds are offered in five- or 10-year increments: 2015, 2020, 2025 and so forth. The fund\u2019s manager then adjusts the underlying investments as that year approaches, typically decreasing the portion of stocks and increasing the portion of bonds and other kinds of investments. As an adage in the mutual fund industry goes, a shareholder in a target-date fund can just set it and forget it. But while the ease is appealing, it can obscure complexities and risks, investment experts say. Target-date funds can allocate their customers\u2019 retirement savings to a sometimes bewildering array of securities and use a variety of investing strategies and glide paths, as the gradual asset allocations are known. Overlooking that diversity is like ignoring the differences among a beagle, a bloodhound and a bull mastiff. In 2008, for example, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell by 38.5 percent, an Oppenheimer fund designed for 2010 retirees fell by 41 percent, while a 2010 Wells Fargo fund lost only 11 percent. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m a part-time adjunct professor at Boston College.)The professors attributed their findings partly to efforts by newer funds to distinguish themselves in a crowded market. Some funds bet more heavily on riskier fare, such as investments in stocks of small-capitalization companies and emerging markets, they said. \u201cIf regulators had assumed that T.D.F.s with the same target date would provide investors with the same exposure to risk, they were mistaken,\u201d the scholars wrote. Target-date funds can be hard for nonprofessionals to evaluate, Professor Reuter said. Typically, one would be structured as a fund of funds \u2014 that is, a fund that invests in a group of underlying funds. So, to assess one, you also have to examine its component funds. In general, T.D.F.s based on index funds, rather than actively managed funds, are less risky, he said. Likewise, cheaper funds also tend to be have lower risk. \u201cMore expensive T.D.F.s tend to invest in more expensive underlying active funds, which tend to focus on riskier asset classes,\u201d he said. Some target-date funds, like those offered by Vanguard, invest passively, trying to replicate the broad stock and bond markets\u2019 returns. Others, like those offered by T. Rowe Price and American Funds, invest activelySome funds stick mostly with stocks, bonds and cash. Others include more exotic offerings like commodities, hedge funds, private equity and direct investments in real estate.A greater variety of securities isn\u2019t necessarily better, Mr. Jones cautioned. \u201cMost individuals don\u2019t need additional exposure to commodities and real estate,\u201d he said. A \u201clot of these more esoteric investments just add cost without adding significant benefits.\u201d Managers of funds that invest in less-common sorts of securities offer a different view. Their reasoning tends to boil down to a single word: diversification. By spreading their bets more broadly, they say, they better insulate their funds from losses in any particular asset class. Pimco\u2019s funds also typically include smaller allocations of stocks and bigger ones of bonds than the typical target-date fund, according to Mr. Bhansali. Many funds invest too much in stocks and so expose their customers to the possibility of big losses when the stock market sinks, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide protection against shocks and high inflation,\u201d he said. Over the three years through 2014, Pimco\u2019s 2015 fund returned an annualized average of 4.55 percent, compared with an annualized average of 7.54 percent for its average Morningstar peer. If you\u2019re investing in stocks, as the fund managers at Manning & Napier also do, you have to determine prices at which you\u2019re willing to buy and sell, he said. Incorporating stock options is similar: You\u2019re just selling someone else the right to buy a stock from you, or sell it to you, at a particular price. When an option pays off, \u201cyou\u2019re earning an additional premium to something you\u2019d be doing anyway,\u201d he said. As people get close to retirement, for example, they tend to worry more about inflation eating away at their savings. \u201cSo you want to manage against inflation risk, and we use real assets like timber to provide that,\u201d Mr. Tyler said.More complicated approaches, however, tend to bring higher costs. The retail share classes of Pimco\u2019s, Manning & Napier\u2019s and Principal\u2019s target-date funds carry expense ratios above 1 percent; by comparison, the Fidelity Freedom Index funds have a ratio of just 0.16 percent, The average asset-weighted expense ratio in Morningstar\u2019s recent report was 0.84 percent. \u201cGenerally, the rule is cheaper is better,\u201d said Janet Yang, Morningstar\u2019s director of multiasset strategies. \u201cFees are the aspect of your performance that you can control.\u201dIn 2006, Congress passed a law that enabled target-date funds to become default investment options in employee-directed retirement accounts like 401(k) plans. The funds have surged in popularity since. Morningstar\u2019s report found that in 2013, T.D.F.s accounted for a third of new assets flowing into the mutual funds of companies offering them.Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard together control three-quarters of the assets in target-date funds, Morningstar said. The offerings range from Vanguard\u2019s straight-ahead simplicity \u2014 its T.D.F.s invest in five of its index funds \u2014 to Fidelity\u2019s host of options. Fidelity T.D.F.s can invest in more than 20 Fidelity funds, including commodity and emerging-market debt offerings. \u201cA T.D.F. can do a lot of work for you,\u201d Ms. Sandhya said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t rely on it blindly.\u201d MS. LEMMERMAN at Hebrew SeniorLife agreed but said that, at least in retirement plans, investors should be getting help from their employers. A plan sponsor is supposed to vet any investment before making it one of its retirement-plan options. She also said she had seen an unexpected benefit of target-date funds through her own investing: Her Vanguard funds had helped her to become more patient with her retirement money, particularly during the stock market\u2019s plunge in 2008. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch my target-date funds then,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that I was in them for the long run and that professionals were deciding how to invest for me. Where I do give more input, with my other investments, I was more concerned. I stopped putting money into equities for a while, but I left the target-date funds alone.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falling Euro Fans Fears of a Regional Slowdown", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The value of the euro fell to its lowest level in years on Monday, prompting sharp declines in European stocks and creating uneasiness about whether the region is on the verge of a new economic and financial crisis.The continued plunge, to a nine-year low against the dollar, came on the same day that global oil prices also resumed their descent, hitting prices not seen in more than five years. While cheap oil can be a good thing for consumers and energy-intensive industries, the growing worry is that the decline signals lower demand and portends a global economic slowdown.In Europe, \u201cthere\u2019s probably as much fear as 2012,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, referring to a period when worries were rampant that the euro currency union would unravel.Mr. Paulsen said such worries were misplaced. And in fact there should be a lot for Europeans to like about the drop in oil prices and Monday\u2019s decline of the euro to $1.19 \u2014 a 15 percent fall against the dollar since May.Products from the eurozone will become more affordable to foreign buyers, even as the energy needed to make those products becomes cheaper. Mr. Paulsen and some other economists said that can only quicken the eurozone\u2019s lethargic economic pulse. New data on Monday from Germany showed that inflation in the eurozone remains at worrisomely low levels, the latest sign of a despondent economy.Other economists say that while the net effect is positive, much of the benefit may be canceled out by negative consequences \u2014 for example, a slump in world demand for exports, including from the eurozone.And one reason for the continued decline in the euro is the much more robust growth of the United States economy, which is prompting global investors to dump euros in favor of dollars.\u201cI\u2019m taking this quite cautiously,\u201d Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura, said of oil prices. \u201cIf oil weakness is due to lower demand, we should be very worried.\u201dEuropean stock markets reflected that worry on Monday, led by a sell-off in shares of energy companies that carried over to the United States when Wall Street opened.At least initially, investors reacted to the new dips in the euro and oil prices with alarm. The benchmark stock indexes in France, Italy and Germany all fell more than 2 percent. Energy-related stocks were among the biggest losers. The German electricity suppliers E.ON and RWE and chemical maker BASF all fell more than 4 percent.The further declines in the euro and in oil did not change expectations that when the European Central Bank meets on Jan. 22 that it would unveil further stimulus, broad-based purchases of government bonds, so-called quantitative easing.When deciding policy, E.C.B. officials are probably focused on the inflation rate more than the value of the euro or the price of oil, and the German data indicated that inflation continues to fall to levels considered dangerously close to deflation \u2014 a downward price spiral that is poisonous for corporate profits.German inflation was just 0.1 percent in December, according to an estimate by the government statistics office.An official estimate of inflation in the eurozone as a whole is to be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the rate to fall to close to zero or even below it, putting further pressure on the European Central Bank to act.The fate of the eurozone economy depends on which school of economic thought turns out to be right, something that probably will not become clear for several months.Eurozone companies that earn revenue in dollars will enjoy a surge in profits, said Mr. Cailloux of Nomura, simply because dollar sales will translate into more euros in the quarterly earnings report. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow, he said, that companies will use the profits to expand European operations and help cut the eurozone\u2019s 11.5 percent unemployment rate.There are still many economists and public officials, though, who maintain that in fact cheap oil and a cheap currency are overwhelmingly good for Europe. One of them is Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.\u201cThe cheaper oil price works like a stimulus program,\u201d he said in an interview published Sunday by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. \u201cConsumers and companies have to spend less and can consume and invest more.\u201dThe statement was a signal by Mr. Weidmann that he remains skeptical about whether more E.C.B. stimulus wasneeded.While a majority of the E.C.B. Governing Council appears to support embarking on a quantitative easing program, members may be reluctant to risk alienating Mr. Weidmann and the larger German public whose views he represents. Germany worries that it might get stuck paying a big part of the bill if the European Central Bank loses money on any eurozone government bonds it might buy as part of quantitative easing.Whether cheap oil and a weak euro help Europe may depend on how long the low prices last. If companies believe that low prices are temporary, they may be in no hurry to invest in expansion and hiring more people.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any change in the market behavior of our customers,\u201d Wolfgang Bernhard, chief executive of Daimler Trucks and Buses, said in an emailed statement. \u201cSo far no one believes that the prices will stay so low forever.\u201dThere is also the fact that eurozone countries tend to be net importers of oil and natural gas \u2014 which is usually priced in dollars \u2014 meaning that their weak currency may not buy as much fuel in the future.Still, gasoline prices for European consumers are significantly lower than they were a few months ago. Pump prices in Germany are down 9 percent since June.Whether economists believe that cheap oil will be good for Europe often depends on how they explain why oil is cheap.Mr. Cailloux cites weak demand as an important cause, which is bad news for the eurozone because of the region\u2019s dependence on trade. He also pointed out that oil-producing countries are important customers for goods from Germany and other eurozone countries.\u201cThe demand from recycling those petrodollars is going to be weaker,\u201d Mr. Cailloux said. \u201cRussia comes to mind.\u201dThose who contend that oil is cheap because of abundant supply are more optimistic. Mr. Paulsen of Wells Fargo belongs to that camp.He argued that the eurozone was poised to benefit from a virtuous combination of low interest rates on loans, cheap oil and a competitive boost from the weak euro.\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to find out Europe bounces this year rather than melts away.\u201dMr. Paulsen said some of the declines in European stock prices on Monday were a beginning-of-year correction after big gains in 2014. But he conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s just panic at the moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Writing Off the Warhol Next Door ", "Date": "2015-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Brant\u2019s five-year-old museum, cloistered as it is, nonetheless is the beneficiary of what is in effect a federal subsidy. Operated by a nonprofit charitable foundation created and controlled by Mr. Brant, this cozy museum is tax-exempt.Wealthy collectors, of course, have long saved millions of dollars in federal taxes by donating art and money to museums and foundations. But what distinguishes Mr. Brant\u2019s center and a growing number of private tax-exempt exhibition spaces like it is that their founders can deduct the full market value of any art, cash and stocks they donate, even when the museums are just a quick stroll from their living rooms.Thanks in part to the skyrocketing value of art and the growing number of collectors who buy it as an investment, private museums \u2014 sometimes in out-of-the-way locations and with strictly limited public access \u2014 have proliferated in the last decade. While these jewel-box museums can house extraordinary work and offer a small group of art lovers an unusual viewing experience, critics wonder whether taxpayers are helping subsidize wealthy collectors\u2019 multimillion-dollar purchases with little public benefit in return.And at a time when concerns about inequality have heightened criticism of government policies that favor the wealthiest sliver of society, these tax breaks have come under sharper scrutiny.Whether the system is rigged or not, the country\u2019s network of museums, great and small, relies on a tax code that encourages rich collectors to share their art instead of keeping it locked away in homes or storehouses. The Association of Art Museum Directors estimates that more than 90 percent of art collections held in public trust by American museums were donated by private individuals. Personal collections have also germinated into cherished institutions like the Barnes Foundation, now in downtown Philadelphia; the Frick Collection in New York; and the Phillips Collection in Washington, all of which started in private residences that showcased the masterpieces acquired by wealthy art aficionados.These museums, along with more recent ones, like the Rubell Family Collection in Miami\u2019s art district, have tens or hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, operate scores of educational programs, publish catalogs and aggressively publicize their exhibitions.Private museums are a \u201cpart of our American art culture,\u201d said Jeffrey Deitch, the former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and now a dealer, calling their recent burst of growth \u201cone of the most exciting developments in the international art world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not against it being done, but it\u2019s got to be done well,\u201d Mr. Storr said. \u201cIf there\u2019s to be a public forgiveness for taxes there should be a clear public benefit, and it should not be entirely at the discretion of the person running the museum or foundation.\u201dThe definition of public benefit, after all, can be subject to interpretation. Mr. Brant\u2019s foundation has organized traveling exhibitions, sponsored lectures and hosted educational workshops for children, a spokeswoman said. But among the charitable activities that specifically involved the Greenwich center and were highlighted on his foundation\u2019s 2012 tax return (the most recent publicly available) were visits by Larry Gagosian, Mr. Brant\u2019s superpowered art dealer, and his fellow billionaire collectors, Victoria and Samuel I. Newhouse Jr.A Matter of AccessA limited number of people, however, get the opportunity to see the art. Like the Brant art study center, Glenstone is open only a few days a week to small groups. Visitors must make reservations in advance and be accompanied by docents.Whereas the Barnes had more than 285,000 visitors last year, and the Phillips received more than 180,000 in 2013, Glenstone had roughly 10,000 visitors from 2006 to 2013. The Raleses and museum officials declined to answer any questions about Glenstone.With the close last month of its most recent show, an exhibition of work by the Swiss art team of Peter Fischli and David Weiss, the Glenstone museum is now off limits to outsiders until the next scheduled opening in June 2015.The Hall Art Foundation, created by Andrew J. Hall, the chief executive of Astenbeck Capital Management, closes its exhibition space in Reading, Vt., from December through May. About 1,500 people have visited since this tiny museum, which is on Mr. Hall\u2019s 19th-century farm, opened in fall 2013, said Maryse Brand, the foundation\u2019s director. According to its 2012 tax return, the foundation has $38 million in total assets.\u201cThe resources and funding that go into the Hall Art Foundation\u2019s spaces, programs and partnerships\u201d \u2014 which include those with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England \u2014 \u201call have a common goal of making artwork available for the enjoyment and education of the public,\u201d Ms. Brand said in an email, and they \u201cfar outweigh any benefits received from tax exemptions.\u201dAlthough Internal Revenue Service guidelines are vague about what private museums need to do to qualify for a federal tax break, experts agree that public access is often crucial.Simply having public hours is not sufficient. The I.R.S. has issued rulings in the form of memorandums that specifically say that private operating foundations must have adequate signs and advertise.Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer who was formerly the director of the I.R.S.\u2019s Exempt Organizations Division, said the agency also looks at whether a private art center is \u201cphysically adjacent to the owner\u2019s home or office,\u201d because that could signal that the art is still primarily for the benefit of the owner, rather than the public.\u201cThose strike me as too clever by half,\u201d he said, referring to museums on or adjacent to a collector\u2019s property.Mr. Owens pointed to an I.R.S. memorandum that revoked the charitable designation of an unnamed collector who placed sculptures near his pool and said they were open for public viewing. \u201cThe fact that no effort was made to advise the general public of the availability of the garden through publicity or signs on the premises,\u201d the I.R.S. said in a 1987 ruling, \u201cindicates an attempt to control and limit the size and timing of groups visiting the property.\u201d Visits by a few groups affiliated with a museum or school were not enough to justify the exemption, the I.R.S. also noted.Mr. Storr at Yale says such guidelines make sense. \u201cInviting a bunch of schoolchildren from a local school is not the same thing as a real educational program,\u201d he said.But I.R.S. rules allow plenty of leeway. Private operating foundations, tax experts note, can qualify for a tax exemption even without letting in a single visitor. Tax-exempt organizations can also fulfill their mission by lending out works, giving grants or making the collection available to researchers.Art as an AssetAlthough there are no verifiable figures on the precise number of private art museums and foundations in the United States, art advisers and tax experts who deal with wealthy collectors say the total is growing. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a major uptick in this area,\u201d said Adam von Poblitz, head of estate planning at Citi Private Bank and a tax expert. He said he was currently in discussions with a half-dozen families about creating private museums or private operating foundations for their art collections.In 2013, a Private Museum Summit was held in London, the first of its kind and a sign of the rapid increase in the museums\u2019 numbers worldwide, particularly in Asia. In the United States, Suzanne Gyorgy, head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank, said that in the past decade she had \u201cseen more and more warehouse spaces being developed into private museums or people building museums on their private property.\u201dDonating to established museums, which also earns a tax break, is still common, but most institutions are selective about what they accept. Many don\u2019t specialize in the contemporary art that now attracts some of the highest prices at auction. Moreover, giving away an artwork means fully relinquishing power over a once-prized possession. As the two-volume \u201cArt Law\u201d guide advises, private operating foundations can be a good option \u201cfor a collector who wants the tax benefits of donating his art collection yet cannot cope with losing total control over the collection.\u201dMr. Lerner, the guide\u2019s co-author, helped popularize private museums in the mid-1980s, he said, by applying the tax code \u201cin a creative manner.\u201d The practice, he said, \u201cgives the ability to have your cake and eat it too.\u201dDorothy Kosinski, director of the Phillips Collection in Washington, said that public funding for the arts was minuscule. \u201cWhy not give these people credit,\u201d she said, \u201cif they\u2019re going to spend their time and money in supporting artists and making their facilities open to the public?\u201dWhile art donated to a charity or foundation ceases to be an owner\u2019s private property, the donor can still control it through the foundation and be eligible for tax deductions. According to Glenstone\u2019s 2012 tax return, Mr. Rales donated $149 million worth of stock, mostly from Danaher, potentially saving him tens of millions of dollars in capital gains taxes. His partner and brother, Steven M. Rales, donated an additional $26 million in stock to Glenstone from the Janalia Corporation, a holding company that the brothers own.Not all private collections that exhibit art take advantage of a tax exemption. Howard Rachofsky and Vernon Faulconer, two Dallas collectors, and Rosa and Carlos de la Cruz, who is chairman of the CC1 Companies, in Miami, have opened small museums with limited hours and access, but neither gallery space is registered as a foundation or charity.In an email, Ms. de la Cruz said her museum was \u201cour way to contribute to society and support education in the visual arts,\u201d and questioned whether individuals deserve an exemption when they still maintain tight control over the art.The Brant Foundation, which operates the art study center and was created in 1996, has more than $93 million in total assets, according to its 2012 federal tax return.Mr. Brant declined to comment about his foundation, but Tisha Kresler, a spokeswoman for him, said it engages in much charitable work, citing a free arts day for homeless children from New York City last year and partnerships with the Greenwich Y.M.C.A. to hold workshops and tours for children. The Brant Foundation also lends art and organizes traveling exhibits. A show at the Greenwich center can attract 8,000 to 10,000 people, she said.That number includes hundreds of gallery owners, artists and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Walken and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny who have attended the center\u2019s opening galas. Fortified by Champagne and barbecue served under an enormous tent on the expansive green, guests have viewed art by some of Mr. Brant\u2019s favorite artists, like Andy Warhol, Cady Noland and Richard Prince. A Julian Schnabel exhibition that ran from November 2013 through March 2014 included several portraits that Mr. Brant had commissioned of his own family.Mr. Lerner, the \u201cArt Law\u201d co-author, suggested that even those collectors who set up museums by their homes serve a long-term public good.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that\u2019s abusive,\u201d he said. After collectors die, their art can become more firmly situated in the public realm, he said, mentioning the Frick and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. \u201cIf you take the long view, I think it\u2019s good for the arts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before the rout on Monday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 38 percent in the last three months. Data released Tuesday morning showed China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy performed slightly better than expected, helping stocks to a modest rebound. By late morning, shares in Shanghai had risen 2.3 percent.But the added leverage also amplifies risk, meaning a boom can quickly turn to bust. Outstanding margin financing had more than doubled in the last six months, recently exceeding one trillion renminbi, or about $161 billion.To help keep that debt in check, the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Friday temporarily banned new margin financing at three of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest brokerage firms. After an investigation into 45 firms, the regulator said that the state-owned brokers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Citic Securities, Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan Securities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 violated rules by extending margin financing and securities lending to a large number of clients beyond the contracted term, usually six months.\n            After rising 65 percent since July 1, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.7 percent on Monday.        3,500SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX3,000JAN. 193,116.352,500\u20137.7%2,0001,5001,000JASONDJ2014\u201915The regulator \u00e2\u0080\u009cworries that some brokers have not been fully compliant in their margin finance operations, which may lead to substantial losses of their clients, and brokers themselves, in case of a market correction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Leon Qi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHence it \u00e2\u0080\u0098engineered\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a market correction.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeparately, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s banking regulator moved to tighten oversight of so-called entrusted loans, a rapidly growing segment of the shadow banking industry. There are concerns that such loans have been used to invest in equities, helping to further fuel the frenzy.A spokesman for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s securities regulator denied in a statement that the moves were intended to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpush down the stock market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead, the spokesman, Deng Ge, emphasized the need \u00e2\u0080\u009cto protect investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overinterpret the stock market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The actions dovetail with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader push to manage its economic slowdown.In an effort to stimulate growth, the central bank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank of China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recently cut interest rates and loosened lending restrictions on banks. Analysts said Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall goal was to ensure that new liquidity created by the easing of monetary policy found its way into productive sectors of the economy, where it can help create jobs and does not just get plowed into the stock market.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stock market fever has made it difficult for the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank of China to further loosen monetary policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Qi, of Daiwa. The securities regulator, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis helping to cool the sentiment on stocks, with the aim that some of the incremental liquidity will go to the real economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dContaining risk is a major priority for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top securities regulator, Xiao Gang. He showed no sign of concern about the tumult as he addressed a financial forum on Monday in Hong Kong.Mr. Xiao did not specifically refer to Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market sell-off. Instead, he praised a new pilot program linking the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very important innovation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It cracks open the door to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still largely closed capital account, he said, in a way that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe risk can be controlled.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut he faces a delicate task in dealing with the excesses of the stock market. While he must aim to let some of the steam out, he must also avoid a runaway sell-off that could create painful losses.The rally, too, looks increasingly precarious. Trading volume in Shanghai peaked on Dec. 9, when shares worth 77 billion renminbi changed hands. The current five-day trading volume is less than a third of that level, at around 22 billion renminbi, signaling that shares could fall from their current levels.At the same time, the pace of new investors piling into the market has slowed. The number of new trading accounts opened on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges declined to 550,000 in the trading week that ended Jan. 9, down from a peak of nearly 900,000 the week that ended Dec. 12.The suspension of new margin financing accounts is likely have a significant effect on the brokerage firms, which had been ramping up such activity in recent months. Several, including Citic and Haitong, had taken advantage of their own surging share prices to announce new offerings of stock, the proceeds of which would partly have been used to invest further in margin financing. Shares in Citic Securities and Haitong Securities both fell by 16.5 percent on Monday in Hong Kong.In an announcement late Sunday, Citic Securities said it would take a number of steps to reduce risk in its existing margin finance business. Among them: raising the minimum amount of assets a client must have to secure such financing, to 500,000 renminbi from 300,000 renminbi.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe company will seriously implement the corrective measures, fully review its existing business process and systems and rules, and conduct business in strict compliance with existing business rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wang Dongming, the chairman of Citic Securities, said in the announcement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Capitalists Save Capitalism?", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the White House to Congress to liberal think tanks, recent Democratic proposals would substantially alter the rules of the marketplace. These include major revisions of the tax code, legislation to pressure corporations to increase pay to match productivity growth and an expansion of refundable tax credits to include low-income workers as well as households making as much as $80,000 a year.According to a report by the former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers and Ed Balls, a top British Labor Party politician, unless there is serious government intervention, inequality and a lack of financial resources among those in the bottom half of the income distribution will result in \u201cinsufficient aggregate demand \u2013 too little spending by consumers and businesses to keep gross domestic product at its capacity.\u201d Developed nations \u201cneed new social and political institutions to make 21st century capitalism work for the many and not the few,\u201d Summers and Balls wrote.The concept of inclusive capitalism has expanded over the past 13 years to apply to those at the bottom and middle of the ladder in developed nations, including the United States. The fundamental \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d argument is that business enterprises lose profit-making opportunities when consumers have little money to spend. Inadequate purchasing power among the many threatens corporations and poses a direct danger to the top 1 percent, and, indeed, to capitalism itself.\u201cWe need to share the wealth,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and a leading proponent of the party\u2019s focus on economics.Schumer, in an interview, voiced strong enthusiasm for the Summers report. \u201cIt could bring together the left and center and even parts of the right,\u201d Schumer suggested.In his State of the Union address, Obama put it this way: \u201cLet\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.\u201dHis plan calls for the imposition of new taxes on the wealthy and on major financial institutions, totaling $320 billion over 10 years. The money would be used to finance tax cuts and credits for low-to-moderate-income men and women, and to make attendance at community colleges tuition-free.Van Hollen, in turn, would raise revenues by imposing a transaction tax on stock trades. He would use the money to finance a $1,000 tax credit for workers making less than $100,000 annually, a $20,000 deduction for two-earner families, an annual $250 payment to those who put at least $500 into an approved retirement pension plan, and to substantially increase child care tax credits.Van Hollen would also bar large corporations from deducting C.E.O. and other corporate compensation over $1 million unless employees got pay raises reflecting increases in worker productivity and the cost of living.Their report addresses four major economic developments broadly undermining wages and working conditions:First, that \u201cincreasing global economic integration has also meant increased competition for many workers who produce tradable goods and services.\u201dSecond, that \u201cadvances in robotics and artificial intelligence have put intermediate-skill jobs at risk in what economists call a hollowing out of the labor market.\u201dThird, that \u201cMajor corporations have opted to use subcontracting to perform basic functions, and many workers are now classified as independent contractors, eroding basic labor law protections.\u201dAnd fourth, \u201ccorporations have come to function much less effectively as providers of large-scale opportunity. Increasingly, their dominant focus has been on maximization of share prices and the compensation of their top employees.\u201dIn addition, Summers and Balls argue that competition in the banking sector has broken down and \u201cwill need interventions to support the reasonable functioning of the free market.\u201dWhat do these points actually signify in practice? In a section titled \u201cU.S. Policy Response,\u201d Summers and Balls call for making parent companies responsible for the working conditions of employees of subcontractors; adopting government policies favoring employee stock ownership so that workers benefit from the growing share of national income flowing to capital as opposed to wages; and imposing tough and costly sanctions on employers who use illegal tactics to fight unionization.Not stopping there, Summers and Balls call for a substantial boost in the $24,000 pay ceiling under which employees must get time and a half for overtime work beyond 40 hours a week; increased infrastructure spending of $100 billion a year, or $1 trillion over 10 years; and strengthened provisions in trade agreements guaranteeing collective bargaining rights and basic environmental protections to reduce the movement of American companies to countries with the lowest labor standards.Among their other proposed policy initiatives are creation of an income tax credit for those with moderate pay levels. It would start at $23,260 for joint filers with children, just where the current earned-income tax credit phases out. At $85,000, the credit would diminish, reaching zero at $95,000. They would also change the mortgage interest and property tax deductions into tax credits. Deductions inherently provide larger benefits to those in higher tax brackets. Credits provide equal benefits to all who qualify.In response to Obama\u2019s plan to tax the wealthy to boost breaks for the working class, Michael Steed, spokesman for the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, said in a statement, \u201cMore Washington tax hikes and spending is the same old top-down approach we\u2019ve come to expect from President Obama that hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d\u201cThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code,\u201d Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement,Josh Bivens, the research director at E.P.I., said in an email that the proposals did indeed \u201clook like a shift in the Democratic Party on economic policy.\u201d He said his hope was that \u201cthe next two years becomes a competition about who is willing to be the most aggressive in trying to boost low/middle-class incomes.\u201dWhile none of the proposals, or their advocates, acknowledge this explicitly, one of the objectives of the evolving Democratic economic agenda is to get back support among whites without college degrees \u2013 the polling shorthand version of what is sometimes still called the white working class.While the new agenda has no chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats plan to use the tenets of inclusive capitalism in the 2016 elections. One Democratic goal in putting specific policies forward is to use them as wedge issues to force Republicans to choose between their affluent backers and their supporters in the white working class. This will be no easy task because a decisive majority of whites without college degrees has been voting against Democratic candidates for two decades, making it very difficult for the party to break what has been a Republican hammerlock since 1994.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Faces Crucial Test of 'Whatever It Takes'", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeLONDON \u2014 The European Central Bank faces a crucial test of its resolve to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro when it decides this week on buying government bonds to combat deflation and revive the economy.The adviser to the European Union\u2019s top court and the Swiss National Bank have smoothed the way for quantitative easing, or Q.E. \u2014 in effect, printing money. But fierce opposition from Germany\u2019s central bank, politicians and public may yet shackle the E.C.B.At issue is no longer whether the bank buys bonds issued by eurozone governments, which has been widely flagged, but how the program is designed and whether it is seen as credible and sufficient.The risk is that the institution that has held the single currency area together through five years of debt crisis adopts a \u201cQ.E.-lite\u201d plan that sends the wrong signal to markets, misses its target and jeopardizes the central bank\u2019s credibility.News that the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, met privately last week with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, highlights the acute political sensitivity of the decision. While Germany\u2019s central bank, the Bundesbank, is opposed to quantitative easing, which it sees as a back door to financing of feckless governments, creating potential liabilities for German taxpayers, the E.C.B. is hoping Ms. Merkel won\u2019t denounce it and will restrain her conservative allies.Some supporters of quantitative easing fear Mr. Draghi may make too many concessions to Germany by framing a program that is limited in volume and scope, doesn\u2019t share risk across borders, and excludes buying bonds of the countries with the lowest credit ratings.A draft plan circulated by E.C.B. staff this month would cap purchases at 500 billion euros, or $578 million. Some market analysts say it may need to be twice that size \u2014 or open-ended \u2014 to reach its objective.Mr. Draghi and his supporters are a majority of the E.C.B.\u2019s policy-making Governing Council, but the two German members \u2014 Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, and Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, a member of the E.C.B.\u2019s executive board \u2014 seem sure to vote against quantitative easing. A few other governors may join them. One option would be to make each national central bank in the 19-nation eurozone shoulder the risk of default on all or most of its own country\u2019s bonds that the E.C.B. purchases.\u201cThis would be at best ineffective and at worst dangerous,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, an economic think tank in Brussels. It \u201cwould be a strong signal that the E.C.B. is no longer a \u2018joint and several\u2019 institution.\u201dThe veteran Danish economist Niels Thygesen, one of the experts who designed the original blueprint for the euro in the 1980s, told Reuters: \u201cIf these are the circumstances for some Q.E., it may not be worthwhile even for strong enthusiasts.\u201d It would be a limited program designed by lawyers as much as economists.Yet by declaring E.C.B. bond-buying legal and urging courts to be cautious in challenging the central bank when they lack the expertise, an advocate general at the European Court of Justice, Pedro Cruz Villal\u00f3n, last week effectively gave a green light for full-blooded action.Although Mr. Cruz Villal\u00f3n\u2019s opinion concerned a lawsuit brought by German euro-skeptics against an earlier, unused bond-buying program, it had clear implications for quantitative easing. In particular, he argued that announcing limits on bond-buying in advance would undermine its effectiveness, that the E.C.B. should not be given seniority over private creditors in case of a debt restructuring, and that there was no bar on its buying bonds of countries with low credit ratings.This should give Mr. Draghi a free hand to buy bonds of all eurozone states proportionate to their contributions to the E.C.B.\u2019s capital for as long as needed to get inflation back toward the central bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent, from close to zero now.But the politics involved may make that impossible. Economists distinguish two main ways in which quantitative easing \u2014 used in the United States, Britain and Japan \u2014 works to revive an economy and raise prices: the \u201csignaling effect\u201d and the \u201cportfolio effect.\u201dIn layman\u2019s terms, the signaling effect describes an unambiguous message to financial markets that a resolute central bank is determined to use unlimited resources to achieve its goal. The United States Federal Reserve is the frequently cited model.\u201cJust as markets know never to fight the Fed, they need to understand that you don\u2019t bet against the E.C.B.,\u201d said a senior Eurosystem official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The portfolio effect describes the mechanism through which a central bank creates money in order to buy bonds from banks, insurers and pension funds, which reinvest it in higher-return assets like stocks and corporate bonds, often outside the eurozone. That exit of funds lowers the exchange rate, making exports cheaper and imports dearer, hence raising the inflation rate.The euro has already fallen from nearly $1.40 in May 2014 to $1.15 last Friday, its slide gathering pace as expectations mount that the E.C.B. will begin quantitative easing.Switzerland\u2019s central bank lifted a hand brake on the euro\u2019s fall last week when it abruptly abandoned a three-year-old cap on the Swiss franc\u2019s exchange rate, which had forced it to buy tens of billion euros to defend the peg of 1.20 francs to the euro.The shock move, which sparked global currency turmoil and inflicted heavy losses on some banks and brokers, showed how hard it is for central banks to tame volatile markets and how easy long-accumulated credibility can be put at risk. That carries lessons for the European Central Bank as it contemplates one of the toughest decisions in its 16-year history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Takes on Quantitative Easing, and Its Risks", "Date": "2015-01-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 As central banks have injected cash into their nations\u2019 economies, a question has raged over whether they have helped average people or simply made the rich even richer.Germans are grumpy that the European Central Bank chose to adopt quantitative easing over their objections. Populist parties from Helsinki to Madrid are feeding on the resentments generated by seven years of economic crisis.Official economic data due Friday is expected to underscore the region\u2019s problems. Unemployment in the eurozone will remain stuck at 11.5 percent, according to analyst estimates. Inflation is forecast to fall to minus 0.5 percent, reinforcing fears that the region is being pulled into a downward price spiral \u2014 deflation \u2014 that would discourage hiring and growth.There is little doubt that some people, countries and industries will cash in more than others. The winners include commercial banks that hold a lot of government bonds and will be able to sell them for higher prices.Another beneficiary will be exporters in Germany and elsewhere in the eurozone, whose goods have become more attractively priced around the world because of a decline in the value of the euro prompted by central bank policy. Investors have been selling euros because they can find better interest rates elsewhere.And people who own eurozone stocks are already reaping the rewards, as market indexes have soared since Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement.And then there are unpredictable chain reactions that quantitative easing could set off.But proponents of Mr. Draghi\u2019s quantitative easing argue that, whatever the potential downside, the most important thing is to do something to prevent an even more severe economic crisis that would hit poor people the hardest.For Mr. Draghi the only objective \u2014 officially, at least \u2014 is to push inflation back up toward the central bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent. Inflation that is too low \u2014 or worse, outright deflation \u2014 undercuts corporate profits, forces down wages and leads to higher unemployment.The stimulus of pumping money into the economy is supposed to automatically raise inflation, although the strategy has not worked in the United States very well because the stronger dollar has lowered the price of oil and other imported goods.The only relevant criterion \u201cis the mandate of the E.C.B. to achieve an inflation target of close to 2 percent,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.Germany, for all its criticism of quantitative easing, stands to be one of the big beneficiaries. But not all Germans will share in the bonanza.For example, the German benchmark DAX index has hit highs since Mr. Draghi\u2019s announcement. Analysts at DZ Bank in Frankfurt forecast that the index would climb even higher.That is great for Germans who own shares or stock mutual funds. But only about 14 percent do. That is in stark contrast to the United States, where about half of all families own stocks directly or indirectly and have profited from the market-stoking effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing.Germany might also be benefiting disproportionately from the recent decline of the euro against the dollar. If Germany were not part of the eurozone, its currency would probably be doing what the Swiss franc is doing \u2014 rising to its highest levels since 2011, as investors look for a haven from global uncertainty. The strong franc is already creating problems for Switzerland\u2019s tourism industry, as well as its watchmakers and other exporters.But German companies are not the only ones that could enjoy a quantitative easing bonus. Italian and French exporters will benefit even more from a weak euro than German companies, Mr. Wolff of Bruegel said, because they are more likely to sell consumer goods like fashion or food products whose price tags are an important competitive factor. German companies tend to sell products like machine tools, where reliability and precision are more important than price.Commercial banks around the eurozone are other possible beneficiaries of the new Draghi policy. The central bank plans to spend 60 billion euros a month, or about $68 billion, in the bond market, which will push down yields, the market interest rates on debt. When yields fall, the value of a bond with a fixed interest rate goes up. Higher bond prices should especially help banks in Italy and some other countries that have large holdings of their own country\u2019s debt.If bankers feel better about their financial health, they may be more willing to lend to small and midsize businesses, which will in turn create jobs. Economists suspect that is exactly what the central bank is hoping for.\u201cA big part of this is just cleaning the bank balance sheets after the sovereign debt crisis,\u201d said Viral V. Acharya, professor of finance at Stern School of Business at New York University.But Mr. Acharya said central bank bond buying was an inefficient way to fix eurozone banks. At the rate that the European Central Bank plans to buy bonds, he said, it will take months for banks to unload their holdings.\u201cBanks are the ones that will have to transmit this policy,\u201d Mr. Acharya said. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic this will happen very fast.\u201dOverly indebted homeowners in Spain and Ireland have reason to raise a toast to quantitative easing, to the extent banks do become more willing to lend. They should be able to refinance their homes at even lower interest rates and make smaller monthly payments.But that benefit will be smaller in Germany, where most people rent their homes and debt levels are low. And besides being renters, Germans are also savers who will earn even more dismal interest rates.As for the most vulnerable people in the eurozone \u2014 the unemployed and the working poor \u2014 there is no certainty that any benefits from monetary stimulus will reach them.The big hope seems to be that the program will improve the mood among businesses, which will be inspired to hire.\u201cIt could have some good implications in terms of the business mind-set,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International.But because the rewards of euro-style quantitative easing are so uncertain, some economists propose a more radical solution to ensure that all citizens get their share.That idea does not sit well with central bankers, though. \u201cIt would be very complicated to do that,\u201d Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, told the broadcaster Europe 1 on Monday.\u201cIf there are things to be done that target citizens directly, it is up to governments to do it,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said. \u201cThat is not our work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gauging Funds\u2019 Emergency Preparedness ", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHENEVER markets are hot, mutual fund companies tend to go far off the beaten track in their hunt for better returns.Perhaps too far.The ultralow interest rates of the last several years have stoked a demand for mutual funds with higher returns. Most of that mom-and-pop money has gone into mainstream mutual funds that make simple bets on the major stock and bond markets. But a large chunk of it has been plowed into funds that have taken much more adventurous approaches. Hugely popular in recent years are funds that invest in opaque debt markets or deploy hedge-fund-like strategies.But now, regulators and even some fund company executives are asking what might happen to such funds if their shareholders want to redeem them en masse during severe market turbulence.Many of these funds have investments that are \u201cilliquid,\u201d the Wall Street word for assets that rarely trade or would be hard to sell quickly. In a market rout, when many shareholders are trying to get out, illiquidity of assets could become a big problem. Specifically, the funds might not be able to sell the investments fast enough to raise the cash needed to make timely payments to the departing shareholders.The commission has a longstanding rule that says fund investors must be able to get their money out of a mutual fund within seven days.Mutual fund specialists who cater to retail investors have been highlighting the potential dangers of funds that have illiquid assets. \u201cAs investors go through the process of picking mutual funds, it\u2019s something that everyone in that process needs to be thinking about,\u201d Sumit Desai, an analyst at Morningstar, said.Ms. White said the commission was scrutinizing funds to assess several potential areas of risk. She noted that one focus was the liquidity of mutual fund holdings. The review may lead the commission to propose new rules for mutual funds, including new regulations on illiquid assets.The commission is not setting out to shield retail investors from losses when markets fall. Instead, its aim is to make sure that mutual funds have not strayed beyond their core mission, which is to provide transparent investments that don\u2019t spring nasty surprises.And the danger of that happening increases as fund portfolios veer from the main stock and bond markets, some asset management analysts say.\u201cIn mature bull markets, you do see people in the mutual funds space going into illiquid assets,\u201d said Stephen Tu, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service who covers asset management companies. \u201cAnytime the funds venture into investments that are not publicly traded, it entails new risks.\u201dThe fund companies say they have taken precautions that will ensure that the mutual funds have the cash to make payouts to shareholders \u2014 and they note that mutual funds held up well during the 2008 financial crisis.But the growth of funds that might have illiquid assets has caught the eye of several regulatory agencies.The S.E.C., for instance, is currently reviewing \u201calternative funds,\u201d which, like some hedge funds, may engage in complicated strategies that can be difficult to unwind. Ten years ago, alternative funds had $33 billion in assets under management; now they have $456 billion, according to data from Lipper. During the financial crisis, many hedge funds had to restrict withdrawals by their investors. And another severe market shock could test these alternative mutual funds, Mr. Tu said.Some concerns right now revolve around mutual funds that invest in leveraged loans.These are bank loans made to companies with low credit ratings. The loans are mostly illiquid and they have yields below those on junk bonds. Even so, mutual funds have found certain features of the loans attractive. The assets of the borrowing company secure the loans. And the interest rate on the loans moves higher if benchmark interest rates go up.An archaic feature of the leveraged loan market could present particular problems for mutual funds. When funds sell stocks and most types of bonds, they can count on getting the cash from the sale in three days. But with leveraged loans, it can often take two weeks or more, far longer than the seven days mutual funds have to make redemption payments to shareholders. So if many shareholders tried to leave a leveraged loan fund at once, the fund might struggle to raise enough cash in time.Companies that manage leveraged loan mutual funds say they have made preparations to deal with potential illiquidity problems. Mutual funds can also focus on loans that are more liquid and could be sold more easily to raise cash. These might include loans to large and prominent companies. Mr. Welsh\u2019s fund, for instance, holds leveraged loans made to Hilton and American Airlines. \u201cPeople ought to know we\u2019re lending to some of the biggest companies in the country,\u201d he said. The fund had $19 billion of assets under management at the end of 2013 and experienced outflows of $1.56 billion last year, according to data from Morningstar. It returned 0.55 percent in 2014, in line with the 0.58 percent average gain for bank loan mutual funds.FUND companies say they have been able to meet redemptions during past periods of turbulence because they have taken very seriously the requirement to be able to pay out within seven days, said Robert C. Grohowski, senior counsel at the Investment Company Institute, which represents asset management firms. \u201cThat is one of the bedrock, sacrosanct legal-regulatory requirements for anyone who runs a mutual fund,\u201d he said, \u201cThat is one section that you don\u2019t play fast and loose with.\u201dFund managers also point out that the recent outflows from leveraged loan funds have not stopped departing shareholders from getting their cash in a timely manner.Appetite for leveraged loans has fallen in recent months as investors have pulled money out of a range of riskier markets around the world. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in bank loans \u2014 mostly leveraged loans \u2014 experienced $13.8 billion of outflows from the end of 2013 through November 2014, according to Morningstar. The outflow is equivalent to nearly 10 percent of the $144 billion in assets held by the loan funds at the end of 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Wallenberg, Patriarch of a Swedish Dynasty, Dies at 88", "Date": "2015-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Wallenberg, who helped build a global conglomerate out of his family\u2019s closely held businesses, a dynasty that was often referred to as a Swedish version of the Rockefellers, died on Monday at his home on the island of Varmdo, in Stockholm County. He was 88. His death was reported by his family\u2019s foundation. For years, starting in 1982, Mr. Wallenberg was chairman of Investor, a company whose various holdings once amounted to roughly 40 percent of shares traded on the Stockholm stock exchange. Its portfolio included stakes in Ericsson, Electrolux, SAS airlines, Astra, Scania, Saab, Gambro \u2014 just about any Swedish company known to Americans. Outside Sweden, the Wallenberg name typically conjures Raoul Wallenberg, the World War II humanitarian credited with saving the lives of thousands of Jews, who was a distant relative. In Sweden, Wallenberg is synonymous with an industrial and financial empire founded by Peter Wallenberg\u2019s great-grandfather Andre Oscar Wallenberg, starting with the bank that he opened in 1856. The Wallenbergs vastly expanded their stature and wealth under the leadership of Peter Wallenberg\u2019s father, Marcus Wallenberg Jr., a former diplomat and tennis star, who controlled the family fortune with a combination of charisma and iron will for decades. He often said that Peter lacked the intelligence and vision to run the company, and Peter was sent for three years to Montclair, N.J., where he sold portable compressors. Marcus intended his older son, Marc, to inherit the company. But Marc committed suicide in 1971, and Peter outmaneuvered the onetime chief executive of Volvo, Pehr Gyllenhammar, whom Marcus regarded as yet another candidate better suited as a successor. Peter Wallenberg was born on May 29, 1926, in Stockholm. He was married and divorced three times. He is survived by two sons, Jacob and Peter Jr.; a daughter, Andrea Gandet; a sister, Ann-Marie Bonsor; seven grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.\u00a0As a businessman, Peter Wallenberg proved formidable. He was portly and often described as disheveled, though always in well-tailored clothes. He was tireless and more than capable of adapting to a business environment that was increasingly focused on international megamergers. He was chairman until 1997. His son Jacob is the current chairman. For years, the family\u2019s motto had been \u201cEsse non videri,\u201d Latin for \u201cTo be, not to seem,\u201d reflecting a quiet, almost provincial approach to deal-making. But by the 1990s, there was a limit to how much Investor could grow without venturing beyond Sweden\u2019s borders. Under Mr. Wallenberg, Investor stepped directly into foreign markets. In 1996, for instance, it sold 50 percent of Scania, a truck manufacturer, on the London, Stockholm and New York exchanges in what was then one of the world\u2019s largest initial public offerings, raising $2.7 billion.

{"Headline": "When Judging Financial Advisers, Look Beyond the Annual Return", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWith the 11.4 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index in 2014, chances are most investors saw their portfolios rise in 2014. But does that mean their advisers did a good job for them? Answering that may be more difficult.\u201cReturns are a piece of the puzzle,\u201d said Tom Robinson, managing director for the Americas at the CFA Institute, which administers the chartered financial analyst designation. \u201cBut I\u2019d probably look at those last.\u201dWhat comes before returns when assessing your adviser? Communication tops most lists, but that is a pretty fuzzy thing to measure. Helping clients set goals and then holding them to them is on the list. But so, too, is the humility to admit what they know and do not know.With the new year off to a bumpy start, it is a good time for investors to ask whether their financial adviser is working for them in a meaningful way.Every investor wants more years of good returns than bad ones. But better advisers are going to get their clients to look away from the ups and downs of the markets and look more deeply at the risk-adjusted portfolio created for that client.Mr. Robinson said advisers should customize benchmarks for individual clients, so they understand how they performed against other investors with a similar risk tolerance.\u201cThey should create an index and say, here\u2019s how you performed relative to that and here\u2019s why you underperformed or outperformed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be for the investor to look at straight under- or outperformance. It should be the adviser explaining why they under- or outperformed.\u201dBeing mindful of these, he said, was a way to keep clients away from \u201ccocktail party benchmarking.\"\u201cYou can\u2019t be a jack-of-all-trades,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go to an attorney, you can have one who closes on your house, but that\u2019s not the attorney you want to draft your wills and trusts.\u201dHe said clients usually come to him in their late 40s or 50s with retirement in their sights. When he analyzes their existing portfolios, he often finds them diversified for risk but not diversified for tax purposes in retirement.This, he said, is the result of previous advisers managing their portfolios for rate of return, not for how those investments can be maximized when there is no longer income coming in.Not surprisingly, Mr. LoCascio does not have many clients in their 20s and 30s.Of course, an adviser\u2019s expertise is not always so clear cut. Eleanor Blayney, consumer advocate at the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, said investors should look for advisers who are fiduciaries, meaning they put their clients\u2019 interest first. But they should also look for advisers who admit when they do not know something.\u201cA good adviser will draw the line when you have issues beyond their field of expertise,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d be wary of someone who gives advice beyond his area of expertise.\u201dJohn Traynor, chief investment officer of the wealth management group at People\u2019s United Bank, said he wrote detailed quarterly investment outlooks for 11,000 clients as well as monthly strategy pieces. Portfolio managers are expected to reach out to clients at least quarterly, he said, unless the client indicates otherwise.\u201cMy largest single client, I have to fight to get on his calendar twice a year,\u201d Mr. Traynor said. \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable with that.\u201dFor some clients, this structure is out of date, since a lot can happen between meetings and correspondence. John Michel, chief executive of CircleBlack, a technology company that helps advisers communicate with clients better, said his firm had created a platform that allows advisers to very quickly send a tailored text or email to clients who might have concerns about how investments might be affected by fast-moving events, like the declining price of oil.\u201cWe found that a couple of communications a month work well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same idea that if an adviser knew you liked wine, he\u2019d read Wine Spectator and send you a copy of the article so you knew he was thinking of you.\u201dAdvisers should also push their clients to be better versions of themselves. Todd Clarke, chief executive of CLS Investments, an asset management firm that gathers assets through advisers, said the best advisers were like personal trainers.\u201cIf you go to the gym on a regular basis you see improvements, but if you go and use a personal trainer, you\u2019re awfully sore the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cThat personal trainer pushes you to excel. An adviser should have that same role \u2014 to help you create that plan and then maintain that plan.\u201dJust as in the gym, not all of the conversations are going to go well. Sometimes your adviser should push back.\u201cYou know you\u2019re working with a good adviser if that adviser is willing to disagree with you \u2014 or at least explain why your thought process may not be the optimal way to think about something,\u201d said David A. Schneider, founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies.\u201cIf the adviser is only recommending things that the client finds intuitively appealing, I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s a red flag, but the adviser is appealing to that client\u2019s biases.\u201dAnd when your adviser gets something wrong, he should own up to it.Mr. Traynor said last year his firm got one big call right \u2014 selling some high-yield bonds to take profits midyear \u2014 and one big call wrong, on Treasury bonds. But he said the firm explained to clients the intellectual foundation for their calls and why they got the Treasury call wrong. Most people, he said, understood.Susan Fulton, founder of FBB Capital Partners, which manages $850 million for 300 clients, said she used software that tracks how often clients are called and alerts her if a client has not been contacted in a quarter.She said she had to come up with a strategy to deal with clients who are intent on going against the company\u2019s investment advice. \u201cWe tell them we\u2019ll open a separate account for them and we\u2019ll invest in whatever they want to invest in, and we won\u2019t charge for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also won\u2019t take responsibility for it.\u201dMs. Blayney of the CFP Board said clients who wanted to assess their adviser relationship should ask themselves three questions: \u201cWhat decisions has your adviser helped you make this year? What decisions have we made together? What can he help me with?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s just going to be decisions about buying and selling,\u201d she said, \u201cyou may want more.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the 2014 return of the S.&P. 500.

{"Headline": "Suddenly, BRIC Markets Are on a Shakier Foundation", "Date": "2015-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFundamentallyInvesting in rapidly developing economies is an inherently risky proposition. That is why more than a decade ago, investors embraced what seemed a prudent approach: focusing on the BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 which have the largest and most liquid stock markets in the emerging-market world.Late last year, though, the BRIC strategy hit a wall as a worrisome series of developments unfolded.First, as the Chinese economy continued to decelerate, global growth expectations dropped, pushing down commodity prices. Then crude oil fell more than 40 percent in the fourth quarter, dropping below $50 last week. Mr. Jayaraman said that back in the 2000s, the BRIC markets represented opportunities driven by the so-called commodity supercycle. That was when rapid growth in countries like China and India drove up demand for natural resources, turbocharging the fortunes of developing nations that were big exporters of raw materials. Among the winners were Russia and Latin America, including Brazil. In general, strong growth shored up emerging-market currencies, improved the financial standing of developing nations and raised corporate profits in these regions. That virtuous cycle, though, has now morphed into a more vicious one.That\u2019s why investors can no longer focus merely on the biggest markets or even just the commodity-producing nations. Investors should start by focusing on countries that are net importers of oil and other commodities, money managers say. Falling energy costs are expected to bolster profits of companies based in those markets, and households should benefit because consumers will have more money to spend on discretionary items. Government budgets are also likely to get some help, Mr. Strabo said.Unlike China, which has excess capacity in major sectors of its economy, India is only now embarking on major infrastructure initiatives, just as prices on steel, copper and other commodities are weaker than they have been in several years.What\u2019s more, India is the world\u2019s third-biggest importer of oil. \u201cAs oil prices have fallen, that has helped lower India\u2019s current account deficit to under 2 percent of G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. Concerns about inflation have eased while the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been able to reduce fuel subsidies without hurting economic growth.One way to tell which economies are more fundamentally sound is to look at the volatile currency markets.For much of the past decade, the currencies of developing nations enjoyed relative strength, as these countries\u2019 economies were growing faster than those of the United States and Europe while also being less mired in debt. But as global economic risks have risen, investors have begun shifting out of emerging-market currencies and into the United States dollar.If other central banks in the emerging-market world followed Russia\u2019s lead, the higher rates could further brake economies that were already slowing.\u201cWe are entering a period of rising rates, so people need to gravitate toward the stronger currencies and countries that are running current-account and fiscal surpluses,\u201d said Mr. Jayaraman at Causeway, adding that he liked Taiwan and South Korea for that reason. At the same time, he said investors should be careful with Russia, Turkey and possibly Brazil.What are other economic signs to look for?Mr. Gray noted that years of cheap credit had sent money pouring into the developing world, making some of these countries vulnerable to turbulence now. \u201cIt\u2019s still an awfully troublesome time for this part of the world,\u201d he said.PAUL J.

{"Headline": "Those Who Nailed 2014 See Volatility This Year", "Date": "2015-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseVolatility will be the new normal in 2015.That\u2019s the overriding theme that emerged in my annual survey of investment professionals who got it right last year. And if this week\u2019s market action is any indicator, their prediction is already being borne out. Stocks soared on Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining over 300 points, the fourth straight session of triple-digit moves. Interest rates and oil prices have also gyrated.Volatility could also be called the old normal, given how common it was before the relatively tranquil years after the financial crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to get a lot more volatility than we\u2019ve become used to,\u201d said William Miller, who runs the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust. \u201cEvery time we get a correction or even close to it, everybody flips out. I\u2019d say that\u2019s more of an observation than a prediction.\u201dMr. Miller returns for a fourth consecutive appearance in this column on the strength of his forecast for the stock market last year. He was far more bullish than most, and said then that he expected the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to gain \u201cin the low to midteens,\u201d which turned out to be exactly right. (It gained 13.7 percent.)\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot trickier this year,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cBut I\u2019m very bullish on the United States economy over all. I\u2019m looking at high single-digit to low double-digit gains for the S.&P. 500, and I could see the S.&P. 500 gain 15 percent if things break the right way. Absent some weird geopolitical thing, I\u2019d be very surprised to see negative returns.\u201dVolatility was also the forecast, if that\u2019s the right word, at the AlphaSimplex Group in Cambridge, Mass., the research and asset management firm founded by Andrew W. Lo, author of the \u201cadaptive markets hypothesis,\u201d which examined whether markets are rational, and director of M.I.T.\u2019s Laboratory for Financial Engineering. \u201cWe don\u2019t forecast rates or valuations,\u201d said Duncan Wilkinson, the firm\u2019s chief executive. That didn\u2019t stop the firm\u2019s Tactical U.S. Market Fund from posting a 14.7 percent return last year, a full percentage above the S.&P. 500.Its quantitative model accurately assessed that risk remained low. \u201cThere was some turbulence in October, but our model suggested it was only middling, and it wasn\u2019t time to do anything,\u201d said Peter Lee, senior research scientist and co-portfolio manager of the Tactical Market Fund. \u201cThis very disciplined approach has stood us in good stead. It takes the emotion out of investing.\u201dWhether the fund can repeat last year\u2019s success remains to be seen, since it\u2019s little more than a year old. (AlphaSimplex has two other liquid alternative mutual funds with longer track records and just started a global macrofund.) The firm\u2019s model currently shows that risks in the United States market are rising. \u201cWe\u2019re still at 130 percent but we\u2019re close to ratcheting that down,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very carefully for the contagion risk of developed non-U.S. markets.\u201d Whither Bonds? If 2014 was a tough year for active stock managers, it was even worse for fixed-income managers. A year ago, almost everyone expected higher rates, including a bearish Bill Gross, a founder of the investment firm Pimco, who told me then that investors should expect \u201cslim pickings\" and stick to cash or low-yielding money market funds. (It was an especially turbulent year for Mr. Gross, who abruptly left Pimco and joined Janus Capital Group.) His advice for this year is much the same, \u201cBe cautious and content with low positive returns in 2015,\u201d he recently wrote in his monthly newsletter.In what has to be considered the biggest market surprise of 2014, interest rates dropped sharply and bonds rallied. The Barclays United States Aggregate Bond Index returned just under 6 percent. United States Treasuries with longer maturities fared even better.Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management (and a widely followed market analyst), was one of the few to forecast lower rates last year in his annual list of \u201csurprises\u201d for 2015. This year, in what he called \u201cthe polar opposite of what I saw last year,\u201d he\u2019s predicting no less than the \u201cend of the three-decade bull market in bonds,\u201d he told me this week.\u201cRates will go lower at first,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will shock people, and everyone will throw in the towel on higher rates.\u201d (So far, he seems to be right about that.) But, he said, once people realize that the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus policies are too little, too late, he expects European rates to rise, followed by those in the United States. \u201cYou could see a spike in European rates without any improvement to their economies,\u201d he said. \u201cItalian sovereign debt interest rates are lower than in the United States. That\u2019s insane.\u201dA fund that capitalized on lower rates last year was Delaware Investments\u2019 Extended Duration Bond Fund, which returned over 17 percent. This year, Delaware\u2019s fixed-income specialists are predicting a modest rise in rates, to just over 2 percent for 10-year United States Treasuries. \u201cWe feel the fundamentals suggest rates can stay in the low 2 percent area, and could end up lower because of dislocation in other markets,\u201d said Roger A. Early, Delaware\u2019s co-head of fixed-income investments.He said he was \u201copen-minded\u201d about whether the Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate this year, as nearly everyone expects. \u201cThe market may be surprised that the Fed takes a step back and doesn\u2019t move forward so quickly,\u201d Mr. Early continued. \u201cWe believe United States economic growth is still quite fragile. So current low yields can be sustained for some time.\u201dWhither Oil Prices?In nearly every forecast for the year, the wild card is oil. The steep fall in 2014, from more than $100 a barrel to less than $50, surprised and rattled many investors, stoked fears of deflation and battered emerging market economies, even as it put more cash in consumers\u2019 pockets. Almost no one saw it coming, but one who did is Michael Levi, senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of \u201cThe Power Surge: Energy, Opportunity and the Battle for America\u2019s Future.\u201d\u201cEarly in 2014, oil prices had been high and steady for a long time, and people extrapolated that this would be indefinite,\u201d Dr. Levi told me this week as prices fell below $50 a barrel. \u201cThat didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dLooking ahead, \u201cAnything is possible,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cbut all the conditions for high volatility remain in place. That\u2019s the natural state of the oil market unless a cartel is in control. Part of the lesson from last year is that a small mismatch in supply and demand can result in a large and rapid change in prices. That works in both directions. If there\u2019s an increase in global growth, geopolitical disruptions or a faster shutdown in North American production, then oil prices could definitely go up.\u201dNor, he said, should Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential influence be ignored. He noted that the kingdom waited until oil prices got into the $30-a-barrel range before curtailing production in the midst of the financial crisis. \u201cJust because Saudi Arabia hasn\u2019t acted yet doesn\u2019t mean it never will,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tempering a Worldview With Freedom and Fairness", "Date": "2015-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyHow is it possible to construct a free-market economy that is also fair? That should be the central question for this year\u2019s annual gathering of the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Free enterprise and globalization, the cornerstones of the Davos worldview, have delivered many benefits over the decades. But since the global financial crisis, the goodies have been few and far between in developed Western economies. Much of Europe has been mired in recession. Unemployment, especially among the young, is rife.Even in better-performing economies like the United States\u2019, the middle classes have experienced stagnant living standards. The fruits of economic growth, such as it is, have been gobbled up mainly by the elite.Hence, the growing inequalities across almost every society that have been extensively documented by the French economist Thomas Piketty.So it should be no surprise that the Davos worldview is under assault. One manifestation is the continuous attacks on the banking industry. But the backlash has gone far beyond finance.It is most visible in the rise of populist political parties across Europe. Their instincts vary, depending on whether they are coming from the left or the right, but they often wish to stop immigration and control free trade. And many want to write off debts or increase public spending \u2014 or do both.A response to the inequality backlash might be to try reasserting free-market values. One could point out that bankruptcy will lead to disruption and even more joblessness. One could argue that protectionism will impoverish countries. One could stress that immigration often enriches the recipient countries, as it is mostly hard-working youngsters who venture abroad. One could even say that globalization has helped hundreds of millions of people escape poverty in developing countries.All this would be true. But it misses the point that the average person in most Western countries hasn\u2019t been doing well, either. Such a situation is probably unsustainable. Most people think it isn\u2019t fair either.The challenge is to devise a modern social market approach to the economy that celebrates freedom and enterprise while also being fair.What, though, is fairness? After all, every political philosopher has a different conception. But any reasonable definition should have at least three elements.The first is that a society should help all its citizens get a decent crack at building a good life. This is not the same as ensuring that they end up with such a life. Governments cannot do this, and, even if they could, it would be wrong to take over people\u2019s lives in this way. There has to be room for individuality, effort, enterprise, creativity and failure.Helping people get a decent crack at building a good life isn\u2019t even as strong a condition as \u201cequal opportunity.\u201d Equality is an impractical objective \u2014 and would run into objections from people who want to give the best they can to their own children. A society has to allow scope for that.Fairness does, however, mean helping the young get a good education and a good start in the job market \u2014 something that many do not get. Only then will they have the tools to thrive in an increasingly competitive world.The second element of such a conception of fairness is that the economy should not be distorted in favor of particular segments of society. This typically means sweeping away monopolies, privileges and restrictive practices.The two most popular targets are politicians and bankers. In much of the world, politicians are considered corrupt. Meanwhile, financiers are hated because they kept their profits in the good times but taxpayers ended up covering many of the losses.The final element of fairness would be a tax-and-benefit system under which those with the broadest shoulders carry the heaviest burden and those in the greatest need receive help.The least contentious aspect of this is to crack down on tax evasion and to close loopholes that allow multinational companies to pay little tax. There is also a strong case for using benefits to support workers with low incomes. That distorts the market less than ramping up minimum wages, a policy that can inadvertently increase unemployment.Some left-wingers also want bigger taxes on wealth, and high tax rates for top earners. The snag is that, beyond a certain level, such taxes undermine enterprise and \u2014 as a result \u2014 jobs. Hefty taxes also give the wealthy a strong incentive to engage in elaborate schemes to hide their money and move it offshore.On the other hand, it would be seem reasonable to put income tax rates and capital gains taxes on more equal footing. Capital gains \u2014 the profit on stocks, real estate and other assets \u2014 tend to be enjoyed by the wealthiest people, but are often more lightly taxed than income.There is also scope in some countries for higher property taxes. The great advantage of such taxes is that people can\u2019t hide property or move it offshore.In Britain, there is a further reason for overhauling property tax. The current \u201ccouncil tax\u201d system is highly regressive, with low-income people paying a disproportionate share of their income compared with the wealthy. Even if one does not want to impose punitive rates on particularly expensive homes, which is the opposition Labour Party\u2019s plan, the tax should at least be proportionate to the value of the property.Such measures would not please most of the Davos crowd. But the people wining, dining and opining this week at the World Economic Forum should look to their enlightened self-interest. Unless enterprise can be made fair as well as free, there is a risk that what is good about the Davos worldview will be swept away with the bad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth Rate Put at 2.6% as Economy Pulls Ahead", "Date": "2015-01-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPowered by healthy spending from increasingly optimistic consumers, the American economy is emerging as an island of relative strength in the face of renewed torpor and turmoil elsewhere in much of the world.Just hours after Russia unexpectedly cut interest rates on Friday in response to a shrinking economy and worries over its banks, and European officials reported more signs of weakness on the Continent, new government data showed the American economy grew at a decent 2.6 percent rate in the final quarter of 2014.That pace represents a downshift from the blistering 5 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter and was modestly below what economists had been expecting. Nonetheless, most economists viewed the report in a positive light and saw the robust consumer spending as pointing to an improving economy in 2015.The combination of plunging energy prices and a healthier job market in late 2014 helped consumer spending rise last quarter by 4.3 percent, the fastest rate of growth since early 2006. And in a separate report on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment in January rose to its highest level since January 2004.\u201cThe windfall to consumption from lower energy prices is showing up,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cAnd we all know that over the long term, where the consumer goes, the economy goes.\u201dNot everything was rosy, though. While consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic output in the United States, there were weaknesses elsewhere that could drag on growth in the months ahead and which are likely to foster continuing turmoil in markets for stocks, bonds and currencies. The country\u2019s trade balance deteriorated, shaving a full percentage point off the overall growth rate, as export gains slowed sharply from earlier in the year, while imports surged.Although any single quarter represents a snapshot of the economy, rather than a nuanced portrait, experts suggested the falloff in net exports reflected a stronger dollar, which makes imported goods more competitive domestically while increasing the price of American products abroad. It also reflected weakness in Europe and other overseas markets, which are becoming tougher for American companies.\u201cAlthough cheaper imports are a boon for shoppers, import growth will subtract significantly from growth in G.D.P. in 2015 and 2016,\u201d said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS. He expects the economy to expand at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015, as lower energy prices encourage shoppers to keep spending, overwhelming other headwinds.Friday\u2019s estimate by the Commerce Department of economic output last quarter is the first of three the government will make; as more data is reported, upward or downward revisions are possible. One clue will come next week, when trade figures for December are released.For all of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of 2.4 percent, roughly in line with the underlying trend of the last five years.One notable negative in late 2014 was a 1.9 percent fall in spending on new equipment by companies, reversing increases of more than 11 percent in the previous two quarters. Many economists expect business spending to be lackluster in the coming months, hurt by deep cuts among drillers and other energy companies because of plunging oil prices.Military spending, which tends to be volatile, plunged last quarter and was another major drag on the overall trend, subtracting about 0.4 percentage point from the growth rate.\u201cThe composition was what we thought: strong private consumption, modest growth in investment and drags from trade and government spending,\" Mr. Gapen added. \u201cBut I think the government spending drag is a one-off and there is tangible evidence that the consumer is in a much better place than in previous years.\"Looking ahead, many economists expect 2015 to start off at about the pace of last quarter\u2019s trend, with growth picking up over the course of the year.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, is looking for the economy to grow by about 2.7 percent in 2015. As was the case last quarter, he expects consumers to more than make up for whatever softness there is in spending by companies.In a separate but closely watched announcement also released Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that its employment cost index rose 0.6 percent in December, slightly better than the figures for hourly wages and about what was expected.This quarterly survey of compensation costs is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, as well as many private economists, to gauge overall wage growth for American workers.This week, the Fed signaled it would not raise short-term interest rates before June, at the earliest. Although Fed policy makers have been encouraged by stronger hiring, they remain concerned about very weak inflation along with paltry wage gains.The 0.6 percent rise in compensation costs was healthy, Mr. Berger said, but not big enough to persuade Fed policy makers to move up their expected rate increase, which he predicts will come in September.By contrast, the outlook in Europe seems to be getting grimmer.In Western Europe, officials said on Friday that prices in the eurozone fell for the second month in a row in January, underscoring weak demand there and highlighting the challenges facing the European Central Bank in getting inflation closer to its annual target of 2 percent, which would help encourage more spending by business and consumers.In Moscow, the Central Bank of Russia abruptly cut interest rates by two percentage points to 15 percent, in an effort to ease the strain on the country\u2019s financial system but risking a further fall in the ruble. Russia, a major energy producer, is also reeling from falling crude prices as well as sanctions imposed as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.\u201cWe\u2019re leading the pack here in terms of economic growth,\u201d Mr. Handler, crediting the Fed\u2019s aggressive efforts in recent years to stimulate the economy, which the E.C.B. has only very recently begun to emulate after years of more timid steps. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do the navel gazing we had in Europe.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Strong Dollar Is Always Good, Except When It Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2015-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesUnited States Treasury secretaries routinely say that they favor a strong dollar, regardless of circumstances or economic conditions. And the dollar is strong right now, thanks in no small part to actions by foreign central banks.The European Central Bank significantly loosened its monetary policy on Thursday, in the process driving down the euro and bolstering the dollar. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar\u2019s value has soared 19 percent since May, and the momentum seems to be building.But is it really a good thing \u2014 for the United States and the global economy?A weaker dollar was, arguably, one of the reasons for the health of the American economy, compared with other nations. The stronger dollar that has resulted from that period of American advantage could reverse some of the progress that the United States has made. That\u2019s not obviously a good thing for the United States.No matter. The dollar is a potent symbol of America\u2019s global power, and United States government officials habitually bow to it, even when their comments aren\u2019t firmly linked to policy or geopolitical reality, said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell University professor of economics who is the author of the \u201cThe Dollar Trap,\u201d a study of the dollar\u2019s role in global finance.\u201cThe notion that a strong country always has a strong currency isn\u2019t something that many countries subscribe to,\u201d he said. As a continental power that doesn\u2019t rely on exports to the extent that many other nations do, he said, \u201cthe United States has been able to sustain the illusion of the importance of a strong currency, but really, when the dollar is fairly strong, as it is now, it\u2019s a mixed blessing for the economy of the United States.\u201dDisentangling the factors that affect foreign exchange rates \u2014 and that make the dollar strong \u2014 isn\u2019t simple. Supply and demand in the marketplace can be masked temporarily by canny trading and improper market activities.For the most part, though, it appears that the dollar has strengthened for substantive reasons: It has become more attractive than other currencies, on a relative basis, because it\u2019s linked to the American economy, which has been growing more rapidly than those of most other developed countries.What\u2019s more, the monetary cycle in the United States has diverged from that in many other countries: The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is considering interest rate increases, and it has ended bond purchases \u2014 or quantitative easing. That reflects the growth of the American economy, a big contrast with Europe and Japan, which are struggling. Last week, the European Central Bank embarked on a new, 1 trillion euro ($1.16 trillion) campaign of quantitative easing, and it has been further lowering interest rates that are already extraordinarily low and sometimes in negative territory.In Japan, the central bank has also been aggressively expanding its quantitative easing program and keeping interest rates low.Furthermore, the dollar has worldwide appeal as a \u201csafe haven,\u201d a destination currency in times of global trouble. That role is likely to become more crucial now that the Swiss franc, another traditional haven, has begun to gyrate wildly in value. That has occurred since Jan. 15, when the Swiss National Bank eliminated the franc\u2019s peg to the euro and started charging banks interest of 0.75 percent to hold their reserves.The Greek elections on Sunday, which have already unnerved financial markets, could well add more immediate luster to the dollar.Whether this is truly good for the United States is another matter.There are some clear benefits, which Mr. Prasad enumerated. Global money flooding into dollar-denominated investments tends to lower interest rates in this country. That typically makes home mortgages cheaper, and a variety of assets more valuable, including houses, bonds and stocks. Americans abroad can buy more with dollars, and imported goods like clothing are cheaper. Add that to the windfall for consumers coming from lower oil prices and it could stimulate the economy.But there are obvious problems, too. There could be negative spillover effects in emerging markets, where corporate debt has increasingly been dollar-denominated. As that debt becomes more expensive in local currencies, financial stress is likely to heighten.American exports tend to become more expensive abroad, too, hurting businesses that make them and reducing the rate of job creation. \u201cIf the dollar were to become much stronger and it persisted, there will be an outcry,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.More than 40 percent of revenue for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index come from abroad, and those with significant foreign operations will have earnings problems, if they haven\u2019t hedged their currency exposure.Bespoke Investment Group offered a good example of how two companies\u2019 fortunes have diverged in the last year, as the dollar has strengthened. In 2008, Altria, the old Philip Morris tobacco group, divided in two, based mainly on revenue source: Altria\u2019s revenue is generated in the United States; Philip Morris International\u2019s revenue is generated abroad.Since the dollar began to rise last year, Altria Group, the domestic company, has skyrocketed, while Philip Morris, the international company, has \u201cflatlined,\u201d Bespoke said in a report to clients.All of which suggests that a strong dollar isn\u2019t entirely and always good, whatever the Treasury secretary says. But it is something we will have to learn to live with.An article last Sunday about the drawbacks of a strong dollar misstated the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing campaign in United States dollars. It is $1.16 trillion, not billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Decoding the Paradox of Rising Cable Stocks", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market is often an early indicator of major developments in finance, the economy and geopolitics. But sometimes that collective wisdom generates signals so difficult to decipher that they seem contradictory. That\u2019s the situation right now for net neutrality and the future of the big cable and telecommunications companies. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to issue a draft proposal on Feb. 5 for significantly tighter regulations for Internet carriers. But the issues involved are so complex and far-reaching that the market is having difficulty interpreting them. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in the stock market have caught up to events yet,\u201d Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG, said in an interview last week. \u201cBig things are happening. The prices don\u2019t seem to reflect all of this yet.\u201dWhat they do reflect is the critical position that the cable companies occupy as the principal pathways to the Internet in America \u2014 a fundamental role that makes them uniquely valuable as well as extremely vulnerable to regulation and political pressure. Oddly, the value of the cable companies\u2019 landlines has been substantiated by the soaring auction prices being offered for the rights to airwaves used to feed data to smartphones, tablets \u2014 and gadgets and services yet to be invented.Then consider that despite the merger\u2019s evident problems, the share prices of both companies have actually risen since early November. That was when President Obama made a speech calling for much tighter regulation of cable and telecommunications companies because they dominate the most important infrastructure for content distribution and communications in the 21st century, a.k.a. the Internet. You might have expected the opposite to have taken place, but, in essence, those increasing prices are saying that both Comcast and Time Warner Cable are more valuable today than they were before the Obama administration toughened its stance on regulation of Internet carriers \u2014 including big cable and telephone companies. On the face of it, that makes little sense.One perfectly valid way of looking at this is to assume that it is simply a market malfunction and that prices will eventually adjust, downward, once the risks of owning the cable stocks are more widely appreciated. Mr. Greenfield, who recently downgraded his assessment of both cable companies, takes this view. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen with regulations, but the chance that we\u2019ll be facing much tighter ones has definitely gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way that these companies would be trading at these price levels if they were being regulated like the old phone companies. Even if that level of regulation isn\u2019t likely to happen, it\u2019s certainly much more possible now. And that should be reflected in the price.\u201dIt\u2019s arguable, at least, that the Internet is even more important to commerce, communications, entertainment, intellectual discourse \u2014 indeed, all of civil society \u2014 than the old phone companies ever were. Celluloid movies, vinyl records and printed books, newspapers and magazines had an independent life that did not depend on the phone companies. But increasingly, our commercial and intellectual creations live in digital clouds and on servers that are embedded in the Internet. Yet until now, the companies that constitute the infrastructure of the Internet have not been subject to the same regulatory constraints that the old phone companies were.That could change very soon. The president\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t a one-off utterance. Since then, the position of the Obama administration has, if anything, become tougher. On top of that, the F.C.C. has been signaling that it favors a more stringent definition of high-speed, or broadband, Internet than it has used in the past, observes Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. Given technological advances, the agency now considers a basic Internet speed of 25 megabits per second \u2014 that\u2019s more than 1,000 times the speed of the early AOL dial-up connections \u2014 as the minimum standard for broadband service. \u201cThat has very serious implications for the merger, and for Internet regulations,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. His calculations indicate that at that speed, a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would control more than 40 percent of the American broadband Internet market, a percentage that might be considered troublingly high for a critical telecommunications artery. That implies that high-speed connections provided by cable companies \u2014 and telecommunications companies with fiber optic connections, as Verizon and AT&T provide in some markets \u2014 are, at the moment, the only real options most people have for access to a service that is becoming more vital every day. And the soaring spectrum prices may have a broader significance: They suggest that wireless service in most locations won\u2019t be a realistic substitute for wired broadband Internet access, Mr. Moffett said: \u201cIt\u2019s just not a realistic option.\u201dThe core regulatory issue is how to best ensure an open Internet, sometimes called net neutrality. President Obama has said that in an open Internet, for example, there shouldn\u2019t be Internet fast lanes, in which companies with deep pockets pay cable or telecommunications companies for faster access to consumers. Banning such practices could limit cable company revenue. On the other hand, Mr. Wheeler and President Obama have both said that while Title II regulations would give the F.C.C. the power to set prices charged by Internet carriers, they have no intention of using it. The idea, favored by Tim Wu, the Columbia Law School professor who coined the phrase \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d is to \u201cforbear\u201d from price setting \u2014 leaving that to the markets, which are usually better at it. The government\u2019s powers would be used to guarantee that this most important communications pathway remained open to all comers. \u201cIt would take an epic change to overthrow the market pricing revolution and to return to price setting for the communications carriers,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the intention here.\u201dThat campaign was focused on net neutrality. But Mr. Greenfield predicted that Mr. Oliver \u2014 or someone else \u2014 was likely to start another campaign over price setting if Title II regulations were put in place. The cable companies are not very popular, he said. \u201cI can start writing the script now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe F.C.C. is saying that cable companies have a monopoly but should be trusted to set prices themselves? Really? Any prices they want? Does that make any sense at all?\u201d Government price setting may not be realistic, but at the very least, Mr. Greenfield said, investors need to understand that there are tough times ahead for many communications companies: Some of them will flourish, but the market has certainly become much more risky.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s So Bad About Cheap Oil?", "Date": "2015-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe sharp drop in oil prices will benefit American consumers, many of the nation\u2019s businesses and the economy as a whole. So why are stock market investors behaving as though oil under $50 a barrel and gasoline prices hovering around $2 a gallon are bad news?But fears about losses emanating from a devastated oil patch have weighed heavily on broad stock indexes, investment strategists say. This response appears to be a case of investors seizing on the industry\u2019s highly visible losers while ignoring the far larger number of winners.\u201cThe stock market has reacted negatively, and some of that comes down to the fact that you can see what the impact is on large energy firms,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s harder initially to see the positive impact that spreads around the rest of the economy. The big benefit to consumers is not as noticeable.\u201dSince the beginning of 2015, the broad market averages have lost roughly 2 percent of their value. The collapse in oil company shares, of course, has been far greater.The Standard & Poor\u2019s index of 80 oil and gas exploration companies is down 11.14 percent in 2015 and 35.4 percent over the last 52 weeks. The S.&P. index of six large oil services companies has fallen 5.2 percent so far this year, and 12.4 percent over the last year.Both indexes reflect the undeniable pain that oil and gas producers, their investors, suppliers, service providers, workers and lenders are going to feel.Layoff announcements, disclosures of capital spending cuts and falling rig counts are all highly visible to investors. So are anecdotal tales of woe from former boomtowns in North Dakota.Less conspicuous, however, are the winners in a world of cheaper oil, economists say. The good news is, they far outnumber the losers.David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., estimates that the economic output among oil companies and related businesses could decline by as much as $150 billion this year because of the oil price collapse. But an increase of about $400 billion is expected in other areas of the economy, he said. The net effect is double the annual value of the two percentage point payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012, which provided a big increase to consumer spending.\u201cThe market\u2019s first reaction to almost any shock is not to like it because it raises the uncertainty premium,\u201d Mr. Kotok said. \u201cMeanwhile, the beneficial effects happen over a longer period, when the change is perceived and anticipated to become more permanent. The difference between temporary and permanent may explain the behavior of the markets here.\u201dTo some degree, investors are operating in an information vacuum: They don\u2019t yet have clarity on the full effects of under-$50 oil.News items about companies mothballing projects that are no longer economically viable have been common: Last week, for example, Royal Dutch Shell canceled a $6.5 billion petrochemical plant deal it struck with Qatar Petroleum in 2011.Still, few of the major oil companies \u2014 which must plan over a long time horizon, building in expectations that prices will eventually rebound \u2014 have disclosed their spending plans for 2015.Another wild card in assessing the impact of the oil decline is the shale oil industry. Because the economics of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are not the same as those of traditional wells, it is unclear how investment and production in this industry will be affected by the price decline.Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics in London noted in an analysis last week that many shale projects had short-term variable operating costs as low as $20 a barrel. Production in such projects won\u2019t necessarily be stopped just because oil prices have fallen to $45 a barrel, he concluded.\u201cMy guess is that in 2014, energy companies spent over $200 billion, mostly on structures but also on equipment,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He now expects that figure to fall by half or more.That\u2019s not pocket change, but capital spending cuts will be small when set against the overall $17 trillion size of our economy. And even if the industry lost half its jobs \u2014 which it won\u2019t \u2014 that would be equivalent to less than a single month\u2019s gain for the overall economy, which added about 275,000 jobs a month last year.\u201cThat completely dwarfs any hits in the oil business, capital spending and oil services business,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said.Investors also seem to be ignoring the benefits of lower-cost oil to small businesses. In December, as the oil price was dropping, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019s optimism index returned to its prerecession average and rose to the highest point since October 2006.The overall economic benefits of the collapse in oil prices are significant, Mr. Shepherdson said. He predicted that it could add almost one percentage point to real gross domestic product growth in the United States this year. In an economy trending at 2.25 percent annual growth, that\u2019s a sizable gain.\u201cThe oil business and everything to do with it is a very small share of the economy,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cCould it possibly be more than 5 percent of G.D.P? No, and the other 95 percent of the economy is saying, \u2018Thank you very much.\u2019 \u201dThe Fair Game column last Sunday, about the benefits to the economy of falling oil prices, misstated the size of the payroll tax cut in 2011 and 2012. It was two percentage points, not 2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Bond Investors, Ignoring Expert Advice Has Been Profitable", "Date": "2015-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersOVER the last three or four Januarys, the advice for investing in bonds has been remarkably consistent. It\u2019s gone something like this: Beware of them, because inflation is going to rise, interest rates are going to spike and bond holders are going to lose enormous amounts of money. When it came to losses, comparisons were made to what happened to equities in 2008.There were exceptions to this analysis, of course. But for the most part, this view was repeated year after year, with charts, graphs and reams of historical data marshaled in its defense. On paper it made sense.In portfolios, not so much. In fact, the exact opposite occurred: Inflation failed to materialize, interest rates went down, and bond holders made money on their investments.But for investors, knowing what to expect from their fixed-income portfolio is essential. Bonds serve as ballast for rough times.This year, the call is for the Federal Reserve to raise the target rate midyear by a quarter- to half-percent and for trading to push the yields on the 10-year Treasury to around 3 percent. Will it happen? Maybe, but then again. ...Jonathan Mackay, senior markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said recent predictions anticipated a normal recovery after a recession, which would have meant bond yields moving back to a range of 4 to 5 percent. The 10-year United States Treasury bond was trading this week around 2.2 percent.\u201cThis doomsday scenario of significantly higher rates hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Mr. Mackay said. \u201cWhat firms got wrong, including us, is the pace of recovery has been slower than expected. Bond yields follow growth.\u201dBut seen from another angle, the interest rate the United States has to pay to borrow money for 10 years is far higher than that paid by economies that are not as solid. This shouldn\u2019t be. Germany and France both pay less than 1 percent on their government bonds; even weak economics like Spain and Italy have been paying less to borrow money, with both under 2 percent.\u201cPeople at this point are incredibly confused,\u201d said Heather Loomis, director of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u201cThis is the point where people are at risk of throwing in the towel.\u201dMs. Loomis said there were at least three reasons for this situation. First, the global recovery hasn\u2019t been consistent. Those low European borrowing rates have pushed investors in those countries to put their money into United States Treasuries, driving down the yield.Third, that adage of never betting against the Fed hasn\u2019t held true. \u201cWhen the Fed says, \u2018We\u2019re going to raise rates,\u2019 and they don\u2019t, that\u2019s also influencing rates,\u201d Ms. Loomis said.Of course, hindsight is perfect. Given the poor track record of recent predictions, how should investors think this year? \u201cMoney flows to the highest yield and that\u2019s the U.S.,\u201d said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, which has $325 million invested in domestic bonds. \u201cIt won\u2019t be exactly the same script in 2015, but it will sound very similar.\u201dShe said that might not cheer United States investors who were used to much higher rates for decades. \u201cSome mom and pops say, \u2018Who would want 2.15 percent on our 10-year?'\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cEveryone who is outside the U.S., that\u2019s who.\u201dFor investors worried about Treasury rates rising suddenly, Mr. Cohen advises clients to buy bonds with shorter maturities, like one, three and five years.Chris Dillon, a global fixed-income portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price, said this year could bring the return of the historical link between 10-year Treasury rates and gross domestic product not adjusted for inflation, known as nominal G.D.P. \u201cThat\u2019s the alive and open debate for 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes the debate more complicated is the complexities of what\u2019s happening on the global stage.\u201d\u201cUltimately, there is much uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.Mr. Mackay of Morgan Stanley, who says he thinks the Federal Reserve will not raise rates until 2016, is still counseling clients on taking credit, not rate, risk on their bonds. (Credit risk, for example, would be high-yield bonds, while rate risk would be a bet on how the yield curve on Treasuries might shake out this year.)\u201cYou still want bonds, even though yields are going to be lower, as an anchor to your portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cInevitably you\u2019ll get some clients who say equities have done well and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to do. Down the road the equity market is going to collapse.\u201dSimilarly, Ms. Loomis said she had been talking to clients about the need to manage their portfolios with fundamentals in mind, even though certain markets have not been obeying those rules.\u201cI\u2019d rather say, \u2018We didn\u2019t make you an additional 50 basis points,\u2019 as opposed to, \u2018We were managing against this trend and it went against us and we lost you 6 percent,'\u201d she said.In a time of uncertainty for fixed income, unconstrained bond funds promote their flexibility. They don\u2019t have to invest just in Treasuries, or in corporate bonds, or in any country or region. They invest in all of it as they roam the world searching for the best bonds. Some even add equitylike investments to the mix.This is certainly true in some instances, but here skill matters: Just because a portfolio manager can roam the globe doesn\u2019t mean he is roaming it in a profitable way, any more than a manager confined to one class of fixed income is good at assessing credit and rate risk in just those bonds.David Hoffman, co-lead portfolio manager of Brandywine Global\u2019s fixed-income strategy, runs an unconstrained global bond fund that since its inception has beat both the World Bond index and the Barclays United States Aggregate Bond index, according to Morningstar.\u201cWe\u2019ve done generally well because we\u2019ve had the opportunity to select where in the world is the best area for bonds and not just select in one country and get the timing precisely right \u2014 that\u2019s really hard to do,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cMore important for us is what we don\u2019t buy. If you don\u2019t own something, you don\u2019t make money for clients, but you don\u2019t lose money.\u201dBut the style of these funds, even Mr. Hoffman admits, isn\u2019t for everyone, particularly those investors concerned with how their investments are performing against a single benchmark.Naturally, all of this thinking about fixed income may be wrong again this year \u2014 at least that\u2019s the contrarian view of John E. Lekas, president and chief executive of Leader Capital and senior portfolio manager on the Leader Capital Total Return Fund.\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you rates are going to stay low for a long time, longer than people think,\u201d Mr. Lekas said. \u201cCountries are not being allowed to grow organically because of free lunch programs.\u201d Instead of inflation, he is worried about the risk of deflation, judging by indicators in the large and liquid markets for commodities, currencies and Treasury bonds.\u201cThose three pools of money tell me we\u2019re heading to a slowdown and it\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden we\u2019re going to get real pricing.\u201dHis advice for this year is asset-backed floating-rate bonds because they have higher credit quality than similarly yielding bonds. But his biggest piece of advice, and one he employs in his own fund, is to have some cash set aside for fixed-income investments that appear during the year.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got the cash, you can really get ahead of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the money to execute your strategy, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dAs for who will be right, there\u2019s only one way to know: Check back in 2016.Advertisement"}

Economists refer to this phenomenon as \u201cincomplete exchange rate pass-through.\u201dWhy that would be is the subject of much academic research, but, using wine as an example, as the euro declines, the \u201cmarkups are also changing,\u201d he said.\u201cThe wine producer will increase its markup in the United States, canceling out the decline in marginal cost,\u201d he said. \u201cFrench firms will not fully pass through the benefits of a stronger dollar to United States consumers, but will get a cut from it in the form of higher markups.\u201dAlison Kenney Paul, vice chairwoman for the retail and distribution sector for the consulting and accounting firm Deloitte, agreed that many European producers of luxury goods were using the strong dollar to pad their margins.\u201cDemand is good enough that they\u2019ll just take the exchange arbitrage and put it into higher margins,\u201d Ms. Paul said. \u201cYou may never see a price difference, and prices could keep inching up. The folks who are buying these brands aren\u2019t that price-sensitive. The luxury of having a great global brand is that you don\u2019t have to rely on price incentives.\u201d(While bigger profit margins may not do much for consumers, they should be great for profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of European exporters to the United States.)Ms. Paul noted that there was also a lag between a change in exchange rates and consumer prices. \u201cThe supply chain for automobiles or even wine is quite extended,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in the pipeline already. It may take six months or more before you start seeing an effect.\u201d Bordeaux wine producers, for example, are expected to announce prices this spring for the 2014 vintage, most of which won\u2019t appear on retail shelves for several years.Harald Hendrikse, European auto analyst for Morgan Stanley in London, said that Porsche was something of a special case, even among luxury automakers. \u201cPorsche has the highest margins in the world. It\u2019s not a high-volume manufacturer,\u201d he said. With demand growing and manufacturing already near capacity, \u201cthey don\u2019t really have any incentive to cut prices.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to get a tremendous benefit on the margins,\u201d he continued.While I didn\u2019t find any bargains among the specific items I went looking for, I did find some on other products, even luxury brands, in the same categories. Sherry-Lehmann was offering a case of 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Cabri\u00e8res Cuv\u00e9e Tradition, another Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, for $399.95 (about $33 a bottle), marked down from $559.35. It was throwing in a free magnum (the size of two regular bottles) to boot.Alex Casella, director of wine sourcing for Vinfolio, said buyers who stockpiled French wines, betting on future price increases, were taking advantage of exchange rates to release stocks now at lower prices. \u201cOlder vintages of Bordeaux, the \u201909s, \u201910s, even the \u201905s, are where we\u2019re seeing some great deals right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much movement yet in the midtier wines, like the Vieux T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe.\u201dBut Mr. Colman agreed that older Bordeaux vintages coming out of warehouses may be the first to show the effects of the weak euro. \u201cAfter that, you may start to see declines in other categories,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competition out there, and I think people in the supply chain have good reason to keep prices down and try to gain market share. It would be great to see prices take a break. I\u2019d drink to that.\u201dAmong luxury automakers, Mercedes-Benz and BMW appear to be in a fierce battle for the crown of best-selling premium import, and they were offering big incentives in December \u2014 up to $5,000 per car in the case of Mercedes and $6,000 for BMW, according to Mr. Hendrikse of Morgan Stanley. Some of this may be seasonal, since the end of the year is typically a good time to buy a car. But he noted that the incentives were higher than in the past.\u201cThe reality is that every carmaker around the globe is facing lower costs thanks to the dollar, except those producing in the United States,\u201d Mr. Hendrikse said. \u201cSo there is going to be more price competition.\u201dAs Ms. Paul of Deloitte told me, some bargains are likely to materialize, but \u201cif you want to find them, you\u2019re going to have to look harder.\u201dAfter my trip to the Cucinelli boutique, I visited the sixth floor of Barneys, just across the street, where the store features its high-end imported brands. An Isaia sports jacket from Italy in a beautiful fabric that fit perfectly was 60 percent off at $1,149, marked down from $2,895.Tempting, but I didn\u2019t buy it. At least not yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil\u2019s Fall Continues Into 2015, and Stock Markets Shudder", "Date": "2015-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices tumbled below $50 a barrel on Monday, spooking global financial markets and signaling that the remarkable 50 percent price drop since June was continuing this year and even quickening.The plunge once again sent fear through global markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 37.62 points, or 1.83 percent, to 2,020.58. The Vix, a measure of market volatility that is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, leaped about 12 percent. And in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 tumbled more than 2.5 percent Tuesday in morning trading. In response, investors sought safety in government bonds around the world. As bond prices rose, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.03 percent on Monday.The decline in oil was not the only source of concern in the markets.Worries about Greece\u2019s ability to stay in the eurozone have reasserted themselves in recent days, for instance. The dollar continued its surge against the euro on Monday.Still, as the oil price decline has continued, investors have increasingly seen it as a bad omen for the global economy. The drop may point to lower demand for oil and lower economic activity. And the decline suggests that policy makers have not managed to deal with the threat of deflation, or falling prices.\u201cThere is certainly a deflationary mind-set in the market,\u201d said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist for FTN Financial, \u201cand as we enter 2015, it\u2019s beginning to nag some people that there could be a deflationary component to the economy.\u201dLeading the way is oil. \u201cIt is a very shaky start for the oil market,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cThe norm is a lot of money comes into commodity index funds at the beginning of the year, and that can create a market rally. Today, instead of new money coming into oil, you got some more old money going out of oil.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude, for example, dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years, and Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell more than 6 percent, to under $53 a barrel.The drop in prices has led to a rising tide of oil company announcements in recent days of investment cuts for the coming months. Ensign Energy Services, a Canadian drilling contractor, reported that it would be laying off 700 workers, or roughly 10 percent of its work force, in California fields. Several Texas-based companies that have borrowed heavily in recent years to produce in new Texas and North Dakota shale fields are expected to announce steep investment and job cuts in the coming days.The last time oil and gasoline prices fell this low was in the wake of the 2008-9 financial collapse, when crude oil fell from well over $100 to below $40 a barrel in a matter of months. Energy analysts say the current price slump is of an entirely different nature, based primarily on a glut of oil being produced in the United States, along with increased production in Canada, Iraq and a handful of other countries.While in the past the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has sometimes agreed to cut back production to shore up prices, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers have decided to protect their global market share by cutting prices in the United States and Asian markets while increasing production somewhat.In a recent interview with Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, based in Cyprus, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated his country would remain steadfast rather than cut production anytime soon. \u201cIf I reduce, what happens to my market share?\u201d Mr. Naimi said. \u201cThe price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, U.S. shale oil producers will take my share.\u201dAdding further pressure to prices is the weakening demand for oil and petroleum products in Europe and developing nations. That weakness is compounded as increasingly efficient vehicles come onto the market and China seeks to reduce the oil dependence of its economy.There is little reason to believe any of those trends will change until midyear at the earliest, energy experts say. According to Simmons & Company, based in Houston, the 93 million-barrel-a-day global market will continue to be oversupplied by at least one million barrels a day during the first half of 2015.\u201cIt might be the dead of winter, but it looks as though markets will confront considerably more downside risk in the months ahead,\u201d according to a Citi Research report released Sunday night, \u201cand it will likely take well into the year before prices will bottom, let alone achieve a new equilibrium.\u201dCiti says it is most probable that the oil market will stabilize by the end of 2015, with the Brent price averaging $63 a barrel for the year \u2014 several dollars above the current price. But its more bearish forecast, with a 30 percent probability, is for Brent to average $55 for the year, roughly the current price.Citi has projected that global investments in oil exploration and production will decline up to 15 percent this year, but American companies continue to produce more efficiently. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian global consulting firm, issued a report on Monday saying that the average break-even price for the principal shale fields in the United States had dropped to $58 a barrel, with the core areas of some fields remaining economical to produce at $50.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Peter Eavis from New York.Advertisement"}

Based on the conditions and their experience, they had planned to avoid the steeper, more dangerous section of the slope. Then, things changed.After skiing another section of the slope four times, they slowly moved into more dangerous terrain. Skiing so close to potential danger without any issues gave them a false sense of security. I\u2019ve been in this position before, too.You tell yourself a story. Everything has been fine so far. Things must be safe. These long periods of safety sow the seeds of future failure as risk creeps in incrementally. It\u2019s so subtle we rarely notice it.Afterward, the skier who got caught said, \u201cI made a number of mistakes and ignored some obvious red flags that all should have been clear signs to back off. I\u2019m just glad all ended well enough, and I had a great group of partners to dig me out.\u201dIt\u2019s fascinating how often we look back on mistakes and see all the obvious warning signs. They\u2019re so obvious we openly admit how dumb we were to miss them. The cause seems to be associated with something I\u2019ll call risk creep.We start with a plan that offers a clear margin of safety. Then, slowly, we allow ourselves to take just a bit more risk. Of course, we don\u2019t call it that. Most of the time we don\u2019t even recognize we\u2019re doing it. As things go well, our perception of risk goes down. We start to feel safe and as a result we take one small step into territory that we previously labeled out of bounds.The process repeats. Take a small risk. Things go well. Increase risk. Repeat until failure.A new year is a great time to examine our financial lives for signs of risk creep.Start with expenses. The normal response to getting a raise, for example, is to let expenses grow to meet the new income. If we\u2019re not careful, this trend continues year after year until one day we wake up and realize we\u2019re spending two or three times more than we did a few years ago.Next, pull out your investment statements. As the stock market does well, we start to believe that it will always do well. We start shifting more of our 401(k) money into stocks and say to ourselves, \u201cRisk? What risk?\u201d It\u2019s really just like a C.D. earning 10 percent, right? It happens so slowly for many of us that we don\u2019t realize we\u2019ve allocated more to stocks than we promised ourselves we ever would coming out of the terror of 2008 and early 2009.Now it\u2019s time to look at our debt. As the economy rolls along, we start to feel more comfortable with debt. We tell ourselves that we can always pay it off \u2014 eventually. It\u2019s particularly dangerous with mortgage debt. Real estate values do not always go up, in case we\u2019ve already forgotten.The remedy for risk creep happens to be what some would argue is the most important word in the English language: remember. Just remember what it was like to watch a retirement account go down by 50 percent (or more) in 2008. Or what it was like to miss a mortgage payment. Then we need to take a close look at where we are in terms of risk creep and remember: things change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Leave a Mark", "Date": "2015-01-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe big debate during the 20th century was about the relationship between the market and the state. Both those institutions are now tarnished. The market is prone to devastating crashes and seems to be producing widening inequality. Government is gridlocked, sclerotic or captured by special interests. Government is an ever more rigid and ineffective tool to address market failures.So over the past generation many of the most talented people on earth have tried to transform capitalism itself, to use the market to solve social problems. These are people with opposable minds: part profit-oriented and part purpose-oriented. They\u2019ve created organizations that look a little like a business, a little like a social-service provider, and a little like a charity \u2014 or some mixture of the three.Hippie companies like Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream led the first wave in this sector, but now you\u2019ve got a burgeoning array of social-capitalist tools to address problems \u2014 ranging from B Corporations like Warby Parker (which gives free glasses to the poor) to social impact bonds. (For example, a private investor raises money to finance a program to reduce recidivism. If the program works and the government saves money because there are fewer prisoners to house, then the government pays back the investor, with a profit.)Impact investing is probably the most promising of these tools. Impact investing is not socially responsible investing. Socially responsible investing means avoiding certain companies, like tobacco growers. Impact investors seek out companies that are intentionally designed both to make a profit and provide a measurable and accountable social good. Impact funds are frequently willing to accept lower financial returns for the sake of doing good \u2014 say a 7 percent annual return compared with an 11 percent return. But some impact investors are seeking to deliver market-rate returns.Brian Trelstad of Bridges Ventures, has looked at companies in early autism intervention, paid for by Medicaid, that can improve long-term educational outcomes while reducing spending on special education; affordable after-school enrichment programs that bring extra education services to charter school students; and energy efficiency companies that serve people in public housing, which saves long term heating costs.When impact funds came on the scene, seven or so years ago, there was the usual overhyping. A 2010 report by the Rockefeller Foundation and JPMorgan projected that impact investing could see new capital inflows of up to $1 trillion by 2020. That\u2019s looking unlikely given that right now roughly something like only $40 billion has been invested through these funds.There are more roadblocks than anticipated. It\u2019s hard to find a reliable way to measure the social impact of these dual-purpose companies. Impact investors have also had trouble finding scalable deals to invest in. It costs as much to do due diligence on a $250 million deal as on a $25 million deal, so many firms would rather skip the small stuff.The hype created skepticism and a backlash. But impact investing is now entering the mainstream. An older generation used their (rigorous) business mind in one setting and then their (often sloppy) charity mind in another. Today more people want to blend these minds. Typically a big client, or a young heir, will go to his or her investments adviser and say, \u201cI want some socially useful investments in my portfolio.\u201d If the adviser has nothing on offer, the client leaves the firm.New impact funds are being born. In a low-interest-rate era, they can offer comparable returns. The Obama administration has been aggressively supportive. Social stock exchanges are being founded. The big players like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse are now in the field.I recently sat in a beautiful New York meeting room with a nicely and formally dressed banker, Andy Sieg, as he discussed the impact fund he\u2019s helping to create at Merrill Lynch. He said his associates, especially his young associates, were extremely eager to work on the project. People are eager to have this kind of impact.Impact investing is not going to replace government or be a panacea, but it\u2019s one of a number of new tools to address social problems. If you want to leave a mark on the world but are unsure of how to do it, I\u2019d say take a look. If you\u2019re a high-net-worth individual (a rich person), ask your adviser to get you involved. If you\u2019re young and searching, get some finance and operational skills and then find a way to get involved in a socially useful investment proposition. If you\u2019ve got a business mind, there are huge opportunities to build the infrastructure (creating measuring systems, connecting investors with deals).Someday government will get unstuck, with new programs to address this new era. But there\u2019s no prospect of that happening soon. Right now social capitalism is a more creative and dynamic place to spend a life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama to Outline Proposals to Bolster a Lagging Housing Sector", "Date": "2015-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The job market is stirring, gas prices are plunging and stocks are near record levels, but a housing sector that dragged the nation into the worst recession since the Depression remains the black spot in an otherwise resurgent economy.President Obama, often criticized for inattention to the housing sector, will seek to address the problem Thursday, lowering insurance rates on federally issued mortgages to first-time home buyers, minorities and struggling Americans. The move is modest, producing savings of $900 a year per home buyer.However humble, the move illustrates just how difficult it has become to stimulate the housing sector since the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals could bring 250,000 new home buyers into the market and lower refinancing costs for an estimated 800,000 homeowners, administration officials said. That is a fraction of the two million to 2.5 million homes that go to first-time home buyers a year in a healthy market. But there are no quick fixes. While housing usually leads the country out of recession, this time, it is an anchor.The financial crisis chased private lenders out of the mortgage market, leaving the federal government with a virtual monopoly. Tighter lending rules imposed after the crisis have made loans more difficult to come by. And young workers who should be first-time home buyers are saddled with student-loan debt in a job market just gaining steam.\u201cSaving the American auto industry was the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Obama told autoworkers. \u201cBetting on you was the right thing to do.\u201dThe president is only tinkering around the edges, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, the real estate website. Mr. Obama\u2019s new proposal and others like it will have little impact until incomes rise more broadly, savings expand and young adults dump their roommates and move out of their parents\u2019 houses.\u201cIt\u2019s not monkeying around with insurance premiums that\u2019s going to fix demand,\u201d Mr. Humphries said. \u201cThe fix has got to come primarily from fixing the fundamentals, especially income growth.\u201dThere should be room for improvement in the housing numbers. Devastated by the Great Recession\u2019s crash, the homeownership rate, at 64.5 percent, is where it was 19 years ago, Ms. Gordon said, and rates are far lower among minority families.But as members of the Baby Boom generation move into retirement communities, more housing will become available. And rents are soaring, an ideal environment for would-be buyers. The buyers, however, are not showing up as they should.Just before Thanksgiving, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew invited economists, demographers and real estate and credit agency executives to dinner to try to find solutions.The problems laid out by the guests \u2014 who included Mr. Humphries, Mr. Myers, Ms. Gordon and Mr. Zandi, among others \u2014 appear intractable. Members of the millennial generation \u2014 Americans born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s \u2014 are marrying and starting families at a very low rate, and their savings are meager.Private lenders have been reluctant to re-enter a mortgage market that is almost wholly owned by the federal government, either through the Federal Housing Administration or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage consolidators that were taken over by Washington at the height of the crisis. Tight credit is making it virtually impossible for millions of Americans to buy their first homes.\u201cF.H.A. has become a large-scale government subprime lender that doesn\u2019t charge enough to risky borrowers,\u201d said Mr. Oliner, who would prefer that the administration press for a large infrastructure program to improve the working-class job market.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who has been pushing to unwind the government\u2019s control of the mortgage market, called it a \u201chead-scratching decision.\u201d The move will increase competition between government agencies \u2014 pitting the F.H.A. against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and could put the F.H.A.\u2019s stretched capital reserves at risk.Of the roughly 13 million homeowners whose mortgages were once larger than the value of their home, about 10 million have since come up from under water.The president\u2019s F.H.A. move is aimed at the key problem, first-time home buyers, said Juli\u00e1n Castro, the housing secretary. Typically, such buyers account for 40 percent to 45 percent of home purchases. In the bubble years before the crash they made up half of all home buyers, Mr. Zandi said. Now they are less than a third.The president\u2019s proposal could open the market to millions just by allowing mortgage access to people now barred by their credit scores, said Barrett Burns, chief executive officer of Vantage Score Solutions.\u201cThat\u2019s boring,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cbut boring works sometimes.\u201dMichael D.
