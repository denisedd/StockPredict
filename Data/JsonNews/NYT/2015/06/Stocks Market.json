{"Headline": "Britain Expects Initial Losses as It Prepares to Sell Its R.B.S. Stake", "Date": "2015-06-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government is ready to exit the banking business, even if it means that it will record a loss on some of its holdings.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a speech here on Wednesday night that the government would begin to sell down the 80 percent stake that it holds in the Royal Bank of Scotland.The speech was at the Lord Mayor\u2019s annual banquet for the financial industry at the Mansion House in the City of London.The government is projected to sell some R.B.S. shares at a loss \u2014 at least initially. But selling some of its stake in the near future would improve the marketability of its remaining holdings in the bank. Thus, taxpayers would ultimately come out ahead from bailing out banks in Britain, Mr. Osborne said.\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for British businesses and British taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cYes, we may get a lower price than Labour paid for it. But the longer we wait, the higher the price the whole economy will pay.\u201dIn the midst of the financial crisis in 2008, R.B.S. received a bailout of 45 billion pounds (about $69 billion) from the British government, while its British banking rival Lloyds received \u00a317 billion.In a report made public on Wednesday, the firm Rothschild, which is advising the Treasury, said that the British government could have lost \u00a37.2 billion (about $11 billion) if it had sold all of its shares in R.B.S. all at once in early June.The government, however, could ultimately recoup its investment plus \u00a314.5 billion from all of its bailouts of the banking sector through repayments and other stock sales, Rothschild said in the report.Initial estimates were that the British government could lose \u00a320 billion to \u00a350 billion from its rescue of the financial sector in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.In its report, Rothschild advised the government to begin selling R.B.S. shares in hopes of increasing the marketability of those shares, particularly if the market continues to remain strong for financial stocks.Mr. Osborne has been eager to reduce the government\u2019s holdings in R.B.S., the Lloyds Banking Group and other financial institutions that were bailed out during the financial crisis. But, the process has been more difficult than some had expected, particularly with R.B.S., which has struggled to turn around its business.Ross McEwan, who became chief executive in October 2013, has scaled back the bank\u2019s global ambitions and is reshaping the lender into a British-focused retail and corporate bank.He has said 2015 will be another \u201ctough year\u201d as the bank continues to restructure its operations and resolve inquiries into misconduct by its employees.On Wednesday, Mr. McEwan said the news of the share sale was a positive development.\u201cI welcome this evening\u2019s announcement from the chancellor and we are pushing ahead with our strategy to build a simpler, stronger, fairer bank that is totally focused on the needs of its customers and centered here in the U.K.,\u201d Mr. McEwan said. \u201cWhen the government starts selling its shareholding, it will be selling a bank determined to be the best in the country.\u201dBy contrast, the government\u2019s exit of its holdings in Lloyds has been much smoother. The government held as much as 40 percent of Lloyds after the bailout, but has pared its holdings since September 2013 as the bank\u2019s finances have improved. Lloyds returned to an annual profit last year and in May, paid its first dividend since the government bailout.Separately, the Bank of England announced the results of a yearlong review of the fixed income, currency and commodity markets following a series of inquiries into misconduct.The review, which included officials from the central bank, the Financial Conduct Authority and Treasury, made a series of recommendations to improve the public\u2019s trust in the markets and impose stiffer penalties for wrongdoing.The report, known as the \u201cFair and Effective Markets Review,\u201d recommended that criminal sanctions be applied to a wider range of financial instruments and the maximum possible sentence for those crimes be lengthened to 10 years in prison, from seven years.The panel also recommended creating new civil and criminal penalties for market abuse in the spot foreign currency market, which has been lightly regulated, and establishing global standards for conduct.\u201cThis is a major opportunity for the industry to establish common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with markets,\u201d Mark J. Carney, the Bank of England governor, said in his speech at Mansion House. \u201cIf firms and their staff fail to take this opportunity, more restrictive regulation is inevitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t the Markets Freaking Out More About the Greek Crisis?", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThese three things are true:The likelihood that Greece would leave the eurozone, devalue its currency and repudiate its debts increased significantly over the weekend.The possibility of that event had sent tremors of fear through global financial markets from early 2010 through the middle of 2012, creating wild swings in stock and bond markets.And on Monday, the market reaction to seeing Greece finally reach the edge of default was pretty quiet, as these things go. European stocks fell 3 percent. Spanish and Italian bonds fell, pushing rates in those countries up, but only to a mere 2.35 percent and 2.39 percent, respectively, for 10-year-bonds, very low by historical standards. The United States stock market was down a mere 0.6 percent in the morning hours as the market initially priced in Greek developments, and by afternoon was down 1.9 percent as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.In other words, financial markets are concerned, and think that the Greek crisis could damage the earnings of European companies and make investors a bit more wary of the debt of other Southern European countries. But they\u2019re not remotely betting that the situation will spin out of control and lead to a full-fledged unraveling of the eurozone or a recession across Europe.That is in contrast with previous flash points in the Greek crisis, including May 2010; November 2010; July through December 2011; and May 2012, when each day\u2019s trading activity was a referendum on whether some catastrophic outcome had become more likely or less.Consider that the Vix, a measure of expected future volatility in the United States stock market, rose 22 percent to 17.1 on Monday. That\u2019s a big increase in percentage terms, but in the summer of 2011, it bounced around between 16 and 43.The question now is whether markets are right, or are being too sanguine.But there really has been a remarkable amount of work done by European leaders to build the institutions and tools that will prevent a Greek exit from spiraling into something more dangerous. Since those panic days of a few years ago, the European Central Bank has pledged to intervene in markets on whatever scale necessary if there is a run on the debt of a eurozone country, and Europe has moved much closer to a truly unified continental banking system. Most Greek debt is now held by government and quasi-government entities, not by German and French banks.So contagion doesn\u2019t have to happen. But here\u2019s an alternate theory.The hedge funds and other investors who were betting on an unraveling of Europe because of the Greek crisis have lost a lot of money since 2012, as interventions by the E.C.B. ensured that bets against Spanish or Portuguese or Italian debt went unrewarded. Indeed, combined with activism by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, anyone who went \u201cshort\u201d on global markets, betting on declines of stocks and other risky assets, has lost money for most of the last three years.So just maybe the entities that would normally be betting that a Greek crisis would spiral into something more dangerous on Monday were out of the game, either gun-shy after the last few years or broke.In other words, if you\u2019re an ordinary American or British or German citizen just hoping that whatever happens in Greece doesn\u2019t affect your economy, the best hope is that financial markets are being rational and farsighted, not narrow-minded and overly influenced by the recent past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.E.C. Charges Man in Bulgaria in Fake Takeover Offer for Avon", "Date": "2015-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lawsuit, the S.E.C. said the man, Nedko Nedev, tried to fraudulently manipulate the stock prices of the two companies by using the Edgar database to submit bogus takeover bids. He had taken positions in the companies and hoped to profit from artificial inflation of their stock prices after the fake bids became public, the S.E.C. said.The S.E.C. said the bids for Avon and Rocky Mountain Chocolate were submitted by two previously unknown investment firms, PTG Capital Partners and PST Capital Partners, which had been approved to file documents to the Edgar database, which businesses and investment professionals worldwide use to submit regulatory filings.The S.E.C. filed the lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan just weeks after what regulators said was Mr. Nedev\u2019s most recent attempt to manipulate the market with a fake bid to buy Avon, the cosmetics company, for $18.75 a share. The takeover bid, which appeared on Edgar, caused the shares of Avon to jump 20 percent before the company issued a statement saying it thought the offer was a hoax.The false bid for Avon raised concern about the integrity of the Edgar database, which more than 300,000 companies, investment firms and individuals use to electronically submit regulatory filings with information that has the potential to move markets.The S.E.C. requires a notary public to verify the signature on an application to submit filings to Edgar, but the agency does not do much checking on those applicants beyond making sure the paperwork is filled out properly. Officials with the S.E.C. have said that doing background checks on every Edgar filer would be costly and might impede the flow of information to the markets.In the case of the Avon bid, the S.E.C. said the notary signature on the application used by PTG Capital to gain access to the Edgar system to submit the Avon bid had been falsified. It is not clear if the notary signature was similarly falsified with the application submitted by PST Capital with regards to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate bid.In the suit, the S.E.C. said Mr. Nedev\u2019s actions \u201ccaused tremendous intangible harm to the U.S. markets\u201d and potentially undermined investor confidence in the Edgar system. It also said he made tens of thousands of dollars in profit, which the S.E.C. is demanding he forfeit.Although the trading profits were small, the S.E.C. said on Thursday it had also gotten a court order to freeze about $2 million in assets in two trading accounts said to be maintained by Mr. Nedev. No lawyer for Mr. Nedev was immediately available for comment.The S.E.C. said Mr. Nedev, 37, used a brokerage account held in the name of a firm called Strategic Capital Partners Muster, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, to trade shares and derivatives in the stocks he tried to manipulate. The complaint also said some trading was done through a company incorporated in Nevada called Strategic Wealth.The S.E.C. said the first time Mr. Nedev used a little-known investment firm to gain access to Edgar to submit a false takeover bid was in December 2012 with Rocky Mountain Chocolate.The S.E.C. suit suggested that others might have been working with Mr. Nedev in his plot to manipulate the shares of the Tower Group, Avon and Rocky Mountain Chocolate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The High Cost of Investing Like a Daredevil ", "Date": "2015-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesLive in the moment: If you\u2019re skiing, surfing or scuba diving, that\u2019s the way to go. But if you\u2019re investing, that approach can lead to disaster. The numbers show that most people who are lucky enough to have money to invest end up underperforming the markets by staggering margins. A big reason for that is living in the moment \u2014 acting in response to ephemeral events. Most of us would be much better off we focused relentlessly on the far horizon, sticking with a simple and cheap plan for getting there. \u201cWhen investors think short-term and try to time the market, they haven\u2019t done very well,\u201d Louis S. Harvey, the president of Dalbar, a Boston research firm, said in an interview. \u201cThey have been leaving a lot of money on the table.\u201dHis company has been chronicling mutual fund investors\u2019 efforts to beat financial markets for many years, and it has found that as a group, typical investors almost invariably lose. The numbers are devastating.For the two decades through December, Dalbar found, the actual annualized return for the average stock mutual fund investor was only 5.19 percent, 4.66 percentage points lower than the 9.85 percent return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Bond investors did even worse, trailing the benchmark Barclays Aggregate Bond index by 4.71 percentage points. In isolation, these figures, which aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, may seem small. But they aren\u2019t when they recur year after year. In fact, because of the effects of compounding \u2014 in which a positive return in one year adds to your stash and can grow further in subsequent years \u2014 those annualized numbers translate into life-changing disparities. Consider a $10,000 investment in the S.&P. 500 index. Using the Dalbar rates, my calculations show that with dividends, that $10,000 would grow to $65,464 over 20 years, compared with only $27,510 over the same period for the return of the average stock mutual fund investors. That gap grows over time. At those rates after 40 years, with compounding, the nest egg invested in the plain vanilla stock index would grow to about $428,550, compared with only $75,680 for the average returns of stock mutual fund investors, a $352,870 difference. Disparities of this order have been showing up year after year in the Dalbar numbers. And with so many Americans forced to rely on their own investing acumen because of the decline of traditional pension plans and lax government rules about financial advice, these awful returns really matter.Why do typical mutual fund investors do so badly? For multiple reasons, and I\u2019ve written about some of them in recent columns. Briefly, actively managed mutual funds over long periods tend to underperform the market, and, as a group, don\u2019t do markedly better than would be expected from flipping coins. Expenses eat into returns. Buying \u2014 and holding \u2014 a low-cost index fund over an extended period would improve the returns of most people radically, the Dalbar numbers suggest.That\u2019s where living in the moment comes in. People tend to make big mistakes in periods of big up or down market moves, when finance is in the news, Dalbar has found. And while chasing better returns, investors often buy into funds that don\u2019t match market returns, once costs are included. When you factor in those choices, typical investors actually earn less \u201cin many cases, much less \u2014 than mutual fund performance reports would suggest,\u201d the Dalbar report says. By buying and selling too frequently and at the wrong times and not benefiting fully from compounding, people typically do even worse than they would have done if they simply held on to their investments \u2014 even if those investments were in mutual funds that themselves trailed the market, Dalbar found. In short, investors have been penalized multiple times \u2014 for buying funds that underperform, for selling those funds at the wrong times and, often, by generating unnecessary costs by trading relatively frequently.Some clues as to why this happens year after year appear when you review long-term market returns. I did that, using historical data from Morningstar\u2019s Ibbotson unit. I examined the monthly returns of a large capitalization stock index and an index modeling the medium-term United States Treasury market over hundreds of rolling one-, five-, 10- and 20-year periods going back to 1926. I also looked at the blended returns of those two indexes in simple asset allocation portfolios. On the positive side, the numbers show the beneficial effects of simply buying and holding portfolios based on the simplest and most straightforward of plain vanilla market indexes over long periods. Over 20-year periods, if investors had been patient enough to wait that long, they could have had remarkably consistent, favorable returns, as the Dalbar study suggests. Over short stretches, though, the data shows that the pure stock portfolio produced stomach-churning variations. Looking at these numbers, it\u2019s no wonder that investors have been alternately frightened and enticed, driving up their own costs by shifting their holdings incessantly into hot funds, usually at inopportune times. But if you had lengthened your perspective, it would have been easier to stay in the market. As the holding periods extended, the growth in the $10,000 portfolio became more consistent. The $10,000 stock portfolio, after 20 years of compounding, ranged in size from a bonanza of $286,386 in the two decades through March 2000, to the modest sum of $14,539 in the 20 years through August 1949. In every rolling 20-year period \u2014 and there were 833 of them \u2014 the returns were positive.It isn\u2019t hard to set up a portfolio like this, either. It can be done by buying low-cost index funds, either as exchange-traded funds or mutual funds, and rebalancing them every so often; many asset allocation funds will do all the work for you. Investors can diversify further by including foreign stocks and bonds but, as John Rekenthaler, vice president for research at Morningstar, said in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about buying hot mutual funds. It\u2019s important not to chase hot asset classes, either. Long-term and steady, both of them, are important.\u201d But to pull off a strategy like this, you would need to ignore the moment and take the long view. If you had done that, you would have beaten most investors and most comparable mutual funds, and you would have an impressive stash.Past performance definitely does not guarantee future returns, and this approach might not work as well over the next five, 10, or 100 years. But it\u2019s a baseline. I\u2019m not sure that anything else is better, at least not for those of us who don\u2019t invest full time. The beauty of this method is that it can be accomplished at low cost by anyone with enough money and discipline, or obliviousness, to take a really long view. Live in the moment, by all means. But invest in the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Index May Add Chinese Stocks, Fueling Investment", "Date": "2015-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stocks do not really need an extra boost. They have tripled in value over the last year to nearly $10 trillion \u2014 overtaking Japan, Hong Kong and Britain and coming in second only to the United States.But new overseas money may soon pour into the mainland, providing more fuel to the country\u2019s already racing markets.On Tuesday, MSCI, a company that compiles indexes widely tracked by money managers around the world, said it could soon add China\u2019s domestic shares to its benchmarks.Mutual funds and other global investments totaling about $1.5 trillion are pegged to MSCI\u2019s emerging-markets index. A decision to include domestic Chinese stocks, or so-called A-shares, in the index means that billions of dollars will be channeled into mainland markets.MSCI, though, wants to make sure the Chinese markets are ready before the floodgates open. The Chinese have made it easier for foreign investors to buy stocks, but they still face significant barriers.MSCI said that in the coming months it would work with China\u2019s main securities regulator to address its concerns and then make a final decision.The decision \u2014 and the waiting period \u2014 reflects the changing face of China\u2019s financial system. While China\u2019s markets and other areas of the economy have rapidly evolved in recent years, they still have not completely opened to the rest of the world.In its decision, the index company cited concerns over China\u2019s cumbersome investment quotas, restrictions on money flows, and questions over the legal status of foreign shareholders. While \u201cinvestors around the world are eager,\u201d Remy Briand, a managing director and global head of research at MSCI, said in a statement, \u201cwe have a strong interest in ensuring that remaining issues are addressed in an orderly and transparent way.\u201dIn the last two years, China\u2019s leaders have pledged sweeping overhauls to the country\u2019s financial system.Progress in some sectors, such as reforming state-owned companies, has proved slow. But other areas have seen a steady drumbeat of changes, including overhauls of the banking system and measures to clean up local government finances.Perhaps nowhere has China moved faster \u2014 and with more immediate implications for global investors \u2014 than with its financial markets.Despite all the new channels into China, foreign investors have moved cautiously, in part because they continue to face challenges in gaining access to domestic markets.\u201cThe bigger story remains, are global institutions prepared to invest in the A-share market?\u201d said Charles Salvador, the director of investment solutions at Z-Ben Advisors in Shanghai, a consultancy that specializes in overseas investment in China\u2019s onshore markets.\u201cTo this day, it has been difficult for global institutional investors to get a clear understanding of the mainland capital markets, thus they have been inactive in pursuing exposure,\u201d Mr. Salvador said. \u201cThe rapidly changing regulatory environment and introduction of accessing platforms in the last two years likely added to the confusion.\u201dThe hesitation has been evident in China\u2019s tremendous stock market rally, which has nearly doubled the total value of the mainland\u2019s A-shares in the year to date. Despite the surge, foreign investors have largely remained on the sidelines.The link between the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets caps the total amount of A-shares that overseas investors can buy at 300 billion renminbi, or roughly $50 billion. But only half of this quota has been used.The situation is similar for other, more established programs that give foreigners access to Chinese markets.For more than a decade, the so-called qualified foreign institutional investor scheme has allowed overseas investors to buy A-shares. The program has been expanded greatly over the years, and now allows for a maximum of $150 billion in investment. But as of the end of May, only about half that amount was used.Under a newer program for renminbi-denominated foreign investment, investors in a dozen countries can buy as much as 920 billion renminbi of Chinese stocks. Less than 400 billion renminbi is actually being used.Still, the broader trend of China\u2019s markets opening up remains clear. MSCI may have delayed including A-shares for now, but other companies that compile such indexes have already made the switch.Last month, FTSE Russell said it would include China\u2019s domestic stocks in its indexes of shares in emerging markets. Likewise, S&P Dow Jones Indices has said it may add A-shares to some of its benchmark indexes later this year.\u201cIt is clear from MSCI\u2019s announcement today that it is only a matter of time before A-shares are added to global indexes,\u201d Louis Lu, a portfolio manager at CSOP Asset Management, which invests in mainland shares, said in email comments. \u201cThis delay will likely prompt the Chinese government to accelerate the opening of its capital markets and provide greater accessibility to international investors in the near term to increase the chance of inclusion as soon as possible.\u201dFor MSCI, analysts estimate that a decision to add A-shares to its emerging market index would lead to several billion dollars of new investment in China initially. The figure, by many estimates, could rise to more than $200 billion over time.On Tuesday, MSCI said it may make a special decision to include Chinese stocks among its benchmarks before its next scheduled annual review, which takes place a year from now. The company added it had reached an agreement with China\u2019s main securities regulator to work on addressing the foreign investment community\u2019s outstanding concerns.\u201cWe look forward to a fruitful collaboration that will contribute to the further opening of the China A-shares markets to international investors,\u201d Mr. Briand of MSCI said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focus Media Reaches $7.4 Billion Deal to List in Shenzhen", "Date": "2015-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Years after delisting in the United States after a short-selling attack, one of China\u2019s biggest advertising companies is hoping to cash in on a market rally on its home turf.Focus and its investors, which also include the Chinese companies FountainVest Partners, Citic Capital Partners, CDH Investments and China Everbright, are trying to tap into China\u2019s surging domestic stock markets. The main Shanghai share index has risen 51 percent this year, while the Shenzhen index, where Focus will be listed, has more than doubled, increasing by 114 percent.Other Chinese companies that retreated from American markets, as well as their private equity backers, are likely to be watching the Focus deal closely. If it goes through and the new shares rise sharply, it could offer an incentive for others to follow suit \u2014 and give private equity firms an easier way to sell their stakes.Focus is coming back to the market through a so-called backdoor listing, in which its main assets are sold to a company already listed in exchange for a controlling stake in the listed firm. Such an approach can offer a more direct path to the market than an initial public offering \u2014 especially in mainland China, where hundreds of companies are waiting for regulatory approval for their I.P.O.s.But such deals can also be complex. In mainland China, they often subject shareholders to lengthy periods during which they are prohibited from selling or transferring shares. Also, unlike an I.P.O., the moves tend not to help the companies involved raise cash.\u201cAll backdoor listings are convoluted exercises, not capital-raising events,\u201d said Peter Fuhrman, the chairman of China First Capital, an investment bank based in Shenzhen, which is in southern China. \u201cWhen you do them domestically in China, they become even more hair-raising.\u201dDozens of Chinese companies retreated from American exchanges in the last five years after a wave of accounting scandals and attacks by short-sellers. Some of those companies were forcibly delisted by the Securities and Exchange Commission; others were taken private by management after their share prices slumped.Focus was the biggest of those privatizations. In November 2011, the company was targeted by Muddy Waters Research, a short-selling firm founded by Carson C. Block. Muddy Waters accused Focus of overstating the number of digital advertising display screens it operated in China, and of overpaying for acquisitions.Focus rejected the accusations, but its shares fell 40 percent on publication of the initial report by Muddy Waters. In summer 2012, the company\u2019s chairman, Jason Jiang, and a group of Chinese and foreign private equity firms announced plans to delist Focus and take it private, a deal that was completed in early 2013.On Wednesday, Jiangsu Hongda New Material, a Shenzhen-listed manufacturer of silicone rubber products, said it would pay 45.7 billion renminbi, mostly by issuing new stock, to acquire control of Focus. Shares in Jiangsu Hongda have been suspended from trading since December, when it first announced plans for a restructuring that did not mention Focus. The shares remain suspended pending further approvals of the Focus deal, including from shareholders and regulators in China.If completed, the deal would leave Mr. Jiang, the Focus chairman, as the biggest single shareholder of Jiangsu Hongda, with a 25 percent stake.The mainland China brokerages Huatai United Securities and Southwest Securities are acting as financial advisers on the deal.Just a few of the Chinese companies delisted from stock exchanges in the United States in recent years have attempted a new listing elsewhere.Last year, China Metal Resources Utilization, a small metal recycling company, successfully listed in Hong Kong. It had been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the name Gushan Environmental Energy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Debt Crisis Sends Stocks Falling Around the Globe", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal markets shuddered on Monday after Greece closed its banks amid fears that the country was headed toward default.Stocks slumped on Wall Street, after markets in Europe were buffeted by worries that the Greek debt crisis would prove contagious and Chinese investors endured another topsy-turvy session.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2 percent, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 was down 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq fell 2.4 percent. The losses wiped out all the gains for the Dow and S.&P. 500 indexes this year.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, comprising the eurozone\u2019s big blue chip companies, closed 4.2 percent lower, after being down about 5 percent at the opening. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 2 percent.Investors have been concerned by the probability that Athens will be unable to meet a 1.6 billion euro, or roughly $1.8 billion, loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund that is due on Tuesday, with uncertain consequences for Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone and even in the European Union.While investors were clearly concerned about the events of the weekend, there was no sign on Monday of widespread panic. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a note that the current situation was \u201ca tragedy for Greece,\u201d but that it was \u201cnot a \u2018black swan\u2019 moment.\u201dThe European Central Bank and other eurozone authorities have had four years to prepare for this moment, Mr. Schmieding wrote, and \u201cwe expect contagion control to work, by and large.\u201dCarl Weinberg, managing director of the research firm High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said the real test would \u201ccome on Tuesday when the I.M.F. payment comes due.\u201dIf Greece fails to make payment, Mr. Weinberg said, the country could be declared either in arrears or in default, with such a determination taking several days. If Greece is declared in default, \u201ca clock starts for creditors to deal with it, and just the existence of that uncertainty will be a cloud over the market, because we won\u2019t know for a while,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd when the big money starts to reposition itself, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see the big moves,\u201d he added.The euro recovered from a drop to trade positive against the dollar, rising to $1.1242 from $1.1160. The 19-nation currency had gotten off to a shaky start as investors initially sought the haven of dollars on fears that Greece\u2019s troubles would have a spillover effect and would make European assets less attractive.Bonds of the most exposed European governments, including Italy and Spain, fell sharply, while their yields \u2014 or interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of prices \u2014 rose. The prices of bonds sold by countries considered safe investments, like Britain, Germany and the United States, all rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent.Greek two-year bond prices plummeted, with their yields rising almost 14 percentage points to about 34 percent, a sign that investors believe default has become increasingly likely. Comparable German bonds were trading to yield less than 1 percent.Greece has been struggling to find a solution to its debt troubles for years. But the speed with which its government called a referendum on the bailout terms and shut its banks appears to have caught at least some investors off guard.\u201cMost people\u2019s consensus forecast was for them to muddle through with some kind of a deal,\u201d said Kymberly Martin, the senior market strategist at the Bank of New Zealand, \u201cso it has taken people a little bit by surprise.\u201dIn the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 350 points, or 2 percent, to 17,596. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sank 43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,057. The Nasdaq tumbled 122 points, or 2.4 percent, to 4,958.European markets fell even more. In Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX lost 3.6 percent while France\u2019s CAC-40 lost 3.7 percent.Protesters held signs reading \u201cno\u201d in Greek and English during an antiausterity rally before the Greek Parliament.The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.9 percent, and the Australian market barometer S & P/ASX 200 fell 2.2 percent in Sydney.The price of gold, which tends to become more popular during times of financial or political instability, edged up $5.80 to $1,179 an ounce.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, reduced one-year lending and deposit rates by a quarter percentage point, effective on Sunday, and reduced the reserves that some banks are required to hold, allowing them to lend more money.The central bank had previously refrained from acting so quickly after a market downturn, so its action over the weekend was interpreted as a clear sign that the government was reluctant to see the Chinese stock markets lose their gains after doubling in the past 12 months.From a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.\u201cIt marks a slight departure from the previous P.B.O.C. moves, because this time it looks to be directly timed as support for the equity markets,\u201d said Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy in Hong Kong at Macquarie Capital Securities, referring to the Chinese central bank.Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for Asia at IHS Global Insight, said that if Greece defaulted and left the eurozone, the effects on Europe\u2019s economy and on exporters in Asia would depend on whether European leaders could prevent financial troubles from spreading to Portugal, Spain and possibly Italy.If the damage is not contained, economic output in Asia could drop 0.3 percent next year on lower exports to Europe, Mr. Biswas said.Ms. Martin of the Bank of New Zealand said such calculations were not at the front of investors\u2019 minds. \u201cI think people are still more concerned about the immediate impact, not the longer-term effects on eurozone growth,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Belgium\u2019s Strawberry Fields, Perfection\u2019s in the Picking", "Date": "2015-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeads UpFor many Belgians, W\u00e9pion has long been synonymous with strawberries. Carefully picked berries from this village, which has been in the strawberry growing business since the mid-17th century, are renowned for their fully ripe flavor. In Brussels, 50 miles to the northwest, W\u00e9pion berries fetch a premium price, roughly twice what the competition is going for.In recent years, though, the W\u00e9pion strawberry has faced stiff competition from growers within Belgium as well as from producers in the Netherlands, Spain and elsewhere. Yet despite being outgunned in both volume and price, the W\u00e9pion growers maintain a strong hold on their small share of the regional strawberry market.The growers rally around their brand, La Cri\u00e9e de W\u00e9pion, and remain a presence in supermarkets in Brussels and area outdoor markets during the late spring and much of the summer. The growers\u2019 big selling point is that with a limited distribution radius they can wait to pick berries at peak ripeness, then quickly ship the fruit to stores in refrigerated trucks. Stocks of W\u00e9pion berries often sell out.I spotted my first box of strawberries with the distinctive W\u00e9pion logo a year ago in May in an outdoor food market in Brussels, where I lived at the time. I bought that first half-kilo box (about a pound) for 6 euros, about $8 then. Given how much I was enjoying the W\u00e9pions \u2014 I was averaging a box or more a week \u2014 and their intriguing context, I decided to visit the village on the Meuse River last June to discover what all the fuss was about.The strawberries come from the region\u2019s cooperative production center and auction house (in French, \u201cla cri\u00e9e\u201d). My Sunday trip coincided with its annual open house.Situated amid strawberry fields, La Cri\u00e9e de W\u00e9pion was not an easy destination. I began with an hourlong train from Brussels to Namur, then by bus 30 minutes south into W\u00e9pion, and then by foot on country roads for the final three miles.I walked into the warehouse, filled with two waist-high stacks of strawberries in flat wooden trays, a few minutes before Paul Gobiet, the Cri\u00e9e auctioneer and spokesman, greeted about 50 fellow visitors.During the hourlong tour, Mr. Gobiet explained how the cooperative began in 1962 to organize the mom and pop strawberry growers in the region and standardize prices. Despite those efforts, family berry patches gradually disappeared.Regional strawberry cultivation endures on about a dozen large farms in the southern French-speaking Wallonia region, not just around W\u00e9pion and Namur but in the neighboring provinces of Hainaut and Li\u00e8ge.The W\u00e9pion and Namur farms produce about 400 tons of berries a year, the Wallonian region about 4,000 tons. Both are dwarfed by the 40,000 tons grown each year in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern half of Belgium.While the north produces \u201creally good berries,\u201d Mr. Gobiet acknowledged diplomatically, W\u00e9pion berries from La Cri\u00e9e are picked \u201cat full maturity,\u201d resulting in superior sugar levels and taste. He discounted myths that W\u00e9pion berries benefit from the region\u2019s soil or fog rolling in from the Meuse.\u201cIt\u2019s the way we pick them,\u201d he insisted.When fully ripe on the vine, the stems are carefully severed by the picker\u2019s (deliberately) long fingernails and then rolled into boxes without finger contact to prevent bruising. Mr. Gobiet dismissed the strawberries that enter Belgium from Spain, China and elsewhere as \u201cfull of chemicals\u201d and colored water, and beneath contempt.Picked in the morning, regional berries are trucked to La Cri\u00e9e in late afternoon each day. After the evening auction the berries are placed in the refrigerated trucks, chilled to about 46 degrees Fahrenheit and travel overnight to supermarkets and stands.Leaving the museum and walking along the Dinant road, the wide Meuse just to my right, I passed several berry stands. I had already stuffed myself, but the bright, cartoonish signs, the plastic tables and the boxes of glistening red fruit were irresistible. I bought another couple of containers for the road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Buybacks That Hurt Shareholders", "Date": "2015-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWe\u2019re in a stock buyback binge. Companies are tripping over themselves to repurchase their own shares this year, and most investors see this as a bonanza. But not all of these buyback programs wind up benefiting shareholders. In fact, some can be quite costly and destroy value rather than create it. On the positive side, companies that buy back shares reduce the amount of stock they have outstanding. This has the effect of increasing earnings per share and the stakes of existing shareholders. That\u2019s why many investors have been pushing for buybacks, especially at companies sitting on mountains of cash.Such calls are being heeded. April was the biggest month ever for buyback announcements \u2014 $141 billion, according to data compiled by Rob Leiphart at Birinyi Associates. If these buyback plans continue at the current rate, they will reach $1.1 trillion this year, he said, well above the peak of $863 billion in repurchase announcements in 2007. In April, Apple and General Electric announced $50 billion programs. In February, Home Depot said it would buy back $18 billion of its stock, and Gilead Sciences chimed in with a $15 billion plan. Also in February, PepsiCo announced a $12 billion program. The best buybacks occur at companies that have concluded \u2014 after careful analysis \u2014 that their stocks are cheap and that purchasing them is a wise use of their capital. But veteran investors warn that companies must combine stock repurchases with other steps if they want to unlock value in their operations. Problems emerge when companies spend billions of stockholders\u2019 dollars repurchasing shares with little to no effect on the amount of stock that remains outstanding. This can happen when they are buying back shares with one hand and, with the other, issuing stock options or restricted shares to executives and other employees as part of their compensation. Consider Qualcomm, a maker of digital wireless communications equipment. Over its last five fiscal years, Qualcomm has been a big buyer of its own shares. Financial filings show that it has repurchased 238 million shares at a cost of $13.6 billion. You might think a buyback program of that size would have diminished the total share count. In fact, Qualcomm\u2019s average diluted share count has actually increased over the period by almost 41 million shares. That\u2019s a 2 percent rise since 2010. How is this possible? Mainly it\u2019s because the company has been granting a treasure trove of stock and option awards to its executives and other employees over the last five years. In that period, Qualcomm\u2019s financial statements show, the company issued 97 million shares to cover these grants. Two-thirds of the shares were restricted stock units; the remainder consisted of stock options. The prices Qualcomm paid to buy back shares and the prices at which it issued them to executives and other employees raise an interesting and troubling question for shareholders. Financial filings show that Qualcomm paid an average of $56.14 a share to buy back stock that is now priced at around $69. That may look like a good deal for shareholders. But wait.Calculate the costs of Qualcomm\u2019s stock-based compensation and it turns out that the company was issuing shares at an average price of $53.54 during that period. On the 97 million options and restricted shares granted by the company over the last five years, that $2.60 difference represents a net transfer from shareholders of more than $250 million. Other dilution created by past grants would increase that figure to $600 million or more. George Davis, chief financial officer of Qualcomm, acknowledged that its return of capital to shareholders in recent years had trailed that of its peers. \u201cWe were coming out of a period where the company went through a very rapid growth phase and the focus really was on executing well,\u201d he said in an interview\u00a0on Thursday. \u201cAs the growth normalized, we saw that we had some catch-up to do, both on the dividend and on share repurchases.\u201dQualcomm has told investors that its new buybacks supplement a plan to return 75 percent of its free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends in the coming years. But Qualcomm shareholders should pay close attention to the impact the company\u2019s stock and option grants have on its share repurchase programs. That scrutiny is important for two reasons. Over the last five years at Qualcomm, Mr. Mollenkopf has received $105 million in total compensation, Equilar said. Second, Qualcomm has been excluding the costs of its generous share-based compensation from the financial results it uses to measure executives\u2019 performance for pay purposes. These are not insignificant sums: Over the past three years, the compensation cost excluded from the incentive pay calculation has totaled $3.2 billion, the company proxy shows. (These figures represent the value of the grants on the date they were given and include shares that have not yet vested.)Had Qualcomm included share-based compensation in one of the figures it uses to measure executive performance \u2014 a version of operating income that excludes certain expenses \u2014 that number would have been 12 percent lower last year. And that would clearly have diminished its top executives\u2019 pay.In March, Qualcomm announced that it was almost doubling its share buyback program to $15 billion; $10 billion of that is supposed to be purchased by March 2016. It borrowed $10 billion in the public debt markets in May to pay for these buybacks, the company said. Qualcomm\u2019s new program appears to be a response to some of the company\u2019s larger shareholders who have criticized its management. And it may very well be a step in the right direction. But as the company executes the buybacks, shareholders will want to ensure that they reap the full benefits of them. Stock buybacks may look appealing, but they are not all created equal.

{"Headline": "Does a Pistol Belong in Your Stock Portfolio?", "Date": "2015-06-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesA white man sat in a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., on June 17 and then proceeded to gun down nine people in a Bible study group. That mass murder has prompted national soul-searching on racism and renewed calls for stricter national gun control regulations. We don\u2019t know what all the ramifications will be \u2014 already there has been an unanticipated rush to remove Confederate symbols from government property and stores \u2014 but history suggests one thing: There is a very good chance that sales of guns and ammunition will surge and that shares of publicly traded gun companies will, ultimately, rise. It has happened before. On Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and slaughtered 20 children and six staff members. As the nation grieved, President Obama pushed for tighter gun control laws. Public pension funds began to divest themselves of their gun company investments. There were calls for individual investors to do the same, and there was extensive coverage of gun control efforts. Those attempts, as we know, were largely unsuccessful. While some states enacted new restrictions, Congress did not. Neither did the business impact of those efforts turn out to be what many people expected at the time. Publicly traded gun companies didn\u2019t merely survive after Newtown, they prospered. In the year after the Newtown shootings, Americans went on the greatest gun-buying spree in history, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry. It estimates that nearly 14.9 million new guns may have been sold that year, more than double the figure for 2000. In Texas alone, its numbers suggest, more than 1.3 million firearms were sold.\u201cThat surge started before Newtown, in anticipation of gun control efforts by President Obama before his second term,\u201d said Mike Bazinet, public affairs director of the foundation. Sales took off after Newtown, he said, as gun buyers sped up purchases.\u201cA lot of people were afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able to buy the guns and ammunition they wanted, or felt they needed, under tighter control,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that gun control didn\u2019t happen.\u201d By 2014, when consumers perceived that gun control efforts in Congress would not succeed, he said, sales began to decline. But they began to pick up again earlier this year. Investors have noticed. Since Newtown, the stock of two long-established publicly traded gun companies \u2014 Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Company \u2014 have turned in remarkable performances, ones far better than the overall market. Thanks in part to a strong earnings report on June 18, the day after the Charleston massacre, Smith & Wesson shares have continued to rise, and they have returned 77 percent in 2015. Sturm, Ruger & Company is up 67 percent this year, dividends included. By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has returned 3.1 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 1.9 percent, with dividends. Now a third company provides a way of investing on a public exchange in guns and ammunition: Vista Outdoor, the product of a merger and a spinoff, began trading in February, and its shareholders have prospered, too. Shares of Vista Outdoor, which says that 65 percent of its revenue comes from guns and ammunition, have risen 34 percent this year. Not long after Newtown, I observed in a column that if you had a 401(k) account through your workplace, there was a very good chance that you were, indirectly, an investor in Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger. That\u2019s because they were widely held in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, so they showed up in 401(k)\u2019s or nearly any broadly diversified stock portfolio that includes small-capitalization stocks or, for that matter, that doesn\u2019t specifically screen out gun companies. That is all still true, despite public calls for divestment of ownership of gun companies on ethical grounds. For example, BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard are the three top owners of Smith & Wesson, according to its March 31 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BlackRock and Vanguard also have large holdings of Sturm, Ruger, with smaller amounts held by Fidelity and other fund companies. Vista Outdoor shares are widely held, too.The three publicly traded gun companies did not respond to requests for comment. Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for BlackRock, said in an email: \u201cAs a provider of passive investment strategies, we have a fiduciary responsibility to replicate the indices our clients have chosen to invest in. However, we also manage hundreds of billions of dollars for investors that choose to screen out certain types of companies or industries.\u201d Adam Banker, a spokesman for Fidelity, said the firm would not comment about specific companies but said that Fidelity, too, offered funds that exclude gun investments. Similarly, John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, said in an email that Vanguard invested in those companies for its fund shareholders. Ten Vanguard funds hold Smith & Wesson shares; 15 hold Sturm, Ruger; and 18 hold Vista Outdoors, he said. For investors who find firearms objectionable, he said, \u201cWe offer the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, which seeks to track a benchmark of large- and midcapitalization stocks, and excludes companies that are involved with firearms, tobacco, alcohol, adult entertainment, gambling, nuclear power, or those that violate fair labor practices and equal opportunity standards.\u201dWhile they may not be available in 401(k) plans, other mutual funds run by firms like Domini Social Investments operate on similar principles. The Domini fund excludes companies with interests in tobacco, alcohol, gambling, nuclear power or pesticides, as well as makers of weapons and other military equipment, said Adam M. Kanzer, the managing director and general counsel of Domini. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be putting our money into guns,\u201d Mr. Kanzer said. \u201cThere are plenty of other ways of investing.\u201dSince the Newtown killings, many pension funds have been shedding their holdings in publicly traded gun companies, as well as in private equity funds, like those run by Cerberus Capital Management, that hold private gun makers in their portfolios. Cerberus controls the privately held Remington Outdoor, formerly known as the Freedom Group. Remington\u2019s Bushmaster assault rifle, also known in the industry as a \u201cmodern sporting rifle,\u201d was used in the Newtown shootings. Cerberus said it would sell Remington; instead, it has allowed pension funds, like the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, that invest with Cerberus to sell their stakes in Remington, while Cerberus maintains its holdings in the gun company. They found that over periods ranging from two to 30 days after a major shooting, those prices tended to be depressed \u2014 a development that has not been obvious after the Charleston shootings. After that 30-day window, typically, this factor is no longer evident in price movements, they said, and the stocks resume their trajectory \u2014 which has generally been upward.In the polarized environment that dominates American discourse, mass shootings in recent years haven\u2019t merely galvanized movements for gun control. They have also led to increased purchases of guns as a form of personal insurance or an act of defiance. The gun industry foundation\u2019s estimates, based partly on federal gun purchase background checks, suggest that in 2013 firearm sales may have exceeded 500,000 weapons in each of these states: Texas, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Missouri. Sales in Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Colorado, Illinois and Indiana weren\u2019t far behind. There were substantial sales in nearly every part of the nation. Shooting is a beloved American sport, and as much as guns terrify many people, they provide a sense of safety to others. \u201cPeople want to protect themselves,\u201d said Mr. Bazinet, of the gun industry foundation. \u201cGun buyers want to make sure they can get the guns they want and are comfortable with.\u201dAs Mr. Anandasivam put it, \u201cOther, deeper factors prevail, and it\u2019s obvious that guns are very popular in much of America and that there has been a lot of money made selling guns.\u201d In fact, sales of semiautomatic weapons \u2014 the very type of firearm used in Newtown \u2014 soared after the killings, as have sales of attachments that convert these rifles into what amount to fully automatic weapons, said Rommel Dionisio, a managing director of Wunderlich Securities. That may have happened partly because of concerns by gun buyers that these weapons would become difficult to obtain. Such rifles are among the most lucrative items made by major manufacturers like Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, Mr. Dionisio said. What may be most remarkable in the years since Newtown is that demand for new guns appears to be strong even though the supply of privately held firearms in America is already mind-boggling. The National Shooting Sports Foundation reports that \u201cmore than 128 million firearms have been made available to the U.S. market\u201d \u2014 meaning, they were produced here or imported for use here through legal channels \u2014 from 1991 through 2012. Yet millions of new guns are sold each year. Gun owners are adding to their collections, and the industry is reaching out to new customers \u2014 marketing its wares to young people and to women, who may not be immersed in gun culture.P. James Debney, the chief executive of Smith & Wesson, said in an investor conference call the day after the deaths in Charleston that long-term prospects for the company were good and that recent earnings had been at the \u201chigh end\u201d of the company\u2019s expectations. Mr. Debney did not mention, and was not asked about, the shootings in Charleston.Over the last year, sales of assault weapons \u2014 he called them modern sporting rifles \u2014 increased, as did sales of pistols, \u201cdemonstrating the ongoing consumer preference for our concealed-carry firearms,\u201d he said. Permits to carry concealed weapons have generally become easier to obtain across the country, despite the efforts of gun control advocates in the last two years, Mr. Dionisio said.Mr. Obama acknowledged the failure of those efforts at a news conference the day after the Charleston killings: \u201cAt some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is in our power to do something about it. I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it.\u201dIf people aren\u2019t running out to buy guns and ammunition right now \u2014 we don\u2019t yet know whether they are \u2014 it may be because they heard the weariness in Mr. Obama\u2019s voice and see little threat of new restrictions. At any rate, the gun companies are trying to give people reasons to buy. New products goose gun sales, as they do other commodities. At Sturm, Ruger\u2019s annual shareholders meeting on May 5, for example, Michael Fifer, the chief executive, spoke of recent innovations. One top handgun, the LCP Custom, \u201chas a lot of improvements to it,\u201d he said, adding that the guns had one cosmetic feature \u2014 a red trigger \u2014 that made them stand out in crowded stores, where they competed for attention under glass in long counters. \u201cThe new red aluminum trigger really pops up under the counter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so folks who already have several LCPs now have excuse to go buy another one, and it\u2019s working.\u201dRed triggers can be exciting in some eyes, disturbing in others. Under the current alignment of regulations in the United States, gun companies will be offering new weapons of a variety of shapes, colors and capacities in coming seasons. Investors \u2014 and that includes people who own small parts of gun companies through mutual funds in their retirement accounts \u2014 may want to judge for themselves whether they will continue to profit from those sales, and whether they feel comfortable doing so.

The S.E.C. filing lists JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank as underwriters.If the expected interest rate is confirmed on Monday\u2019s bond issue, Petrobras will be paying a high price.Before this offering, the company was paying an average interest rate of only 4.4 percent on its $76.4 billion in dollar-denominated debt. Its 30-year bonds sold in 2014 paid a 7.25 percent coupon.\u201cI do not see this move as a positive,\u201d said Mariana Bertone, a petroleum analyst with the brokerage firm GBM in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe cost is very high.\u201dOther issuance is expected soon. Petrobras said late last month that it planned to issue up to 4 billion reais, or $1.26 billion, in debentures in the local market, where interest rates tend to be higher than in the global market.But to keep its heavy debt load \u2013 nearly $130 billion \u2013 from rising too much further, Petrobras announced in March that it would sell $13.7 billion of assets this year and next.Offshore petroleum reserves, electricity generation plants, chains of service stations in other South American countries and parts of its distribution network are all likely to be on the auction block.The company needs the cash to pay for its five-year investment plan, which despite cuts is still expected to total more than $130 billion when it is announced next week. So far this year, Petrobras\u2019s petroleum production has fallen slightly since peaking last December.Despite the company\u2019s problems, it may have a promising future, if global energy prices recover.\u201cIt has the best expertise in the world for deepwater petroleum production,\u201d Ms. Bertone said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Road Map for Eradicating World Hunger", "Date": "2015-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Food for TomorrowThe campaign\u2019s ambitious target of eradicating hunger, experts say, helps lend structure and clarity to efforts to ensure that even the very poorest have enough to eat and to make food systems more resilient in the face of climate change, droughts, floods and other pressures.Zero Hunger \u201cis a challenge and it\u2019s a hope,\u201d said Danielle Nierenberg, president of Food Tank, a research and advocacy organization in New Orleans. \u201cIt gives us a concrete framework so we can get to a situation where everyone is well fed. I think that\u2019s a realizable goal over the next 50 years.\u201dThe goal is more complex than it may sound, however. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not simply for the world as a whole to produce enough food, though the pressures of a warming climate and a growing global population are likely to make that more difficult.Ending hunger has more to do with making sure that the poorest have the means to buy or grow enough to keep their families well nourished and that infrastructure is strong enough and markets sufficiently robust to get food to where it needs to be, the experts say.Even among those who are well fed, infections or other ailments caused by poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water can prevent their bodies from absorbing necessary nutrients, a problem that is particularly acute in India.\u201cWe used to many years ago think of hunger as just growing enough food to feed the world, and I think we\u2019ve now understood it\u2019s not a matter of sufficient aggregate supply,\u201d said Homi Kharas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of making sure the people who really need the food are able to produce and buy it.\u201dIn a world where some of the estimated 2.1 billion overweight and obese people are also malnourished, changing unhealthy and unsustainable food production systems is critical, Ms. Nierenberg said.In Ethiopia, government-backed efforts to strengthen small-scale farmers and lift their productivity by improving fertilizer and herbicide use and expanding irrigation have made a big difference, said Amare Haileslassie, senior researcher at the International Water Management Institute in Addis Ababa.The world is falling short of the goal that presidents and prime ministers agreed to in 2000 of halving the hunger rate by this year. Worldwide, 10.9 percent of people are undernourished, down from 18.6 percent in 1990-92, the food agency reported. In developing countries, the proportion fell to 12.9 percent from 23.3 percent. \u201cWe have come close\u201d but not reached that target, Mr. Sundaram said. And the bar is low, because only those who are hungry year round are counted, and the caloric threshold is conservative, given the need of many poor people to do manual labor, he said.Progress has been concentrated in Latin America, the Caribbean and East, Southeast and Central Asia, Mr. Sundaram said. While the proportion of hungry people in Africa has fallen, the absolute number has increased, he said.Central Africa is one of two areas to have gone backward. The other is West Asia, which includes Iraq, Syria and Yemen. The reversal in both regions, Mr. Sundaram said, highlights the role that political upheaval and accompanying warfare can play in undermining food security.When Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was the country\u2019s president, from 2003 to 2011, improving nutrition \u201cwas obviously something that was very personal to him,\u201d given his focus on fighting poverty, said Mr. Kharas, the Brookings Institution senior fellow.In Brazil and China, school meal programs buy from farm cooperatives, Mr. Sundaram said. That has bolstered small-scale producers, while also requiring them to grow more nutritious crops, a demand that has the added benefit of improving the variety on offer in local markets, he said.In Pakistan, on the other hand, 58 percent of the population still does not get enough to eat, said Abid Qaiyum Suleri, executive director of Sustainable Development Policy Institute, a research organization in Islamabad. While leaders have begun a Zero Hunger effort, and promised more school meals and supplements for young children and pregnant women, \u201cthat plan could never take off, because the Ministry of Finance never allocated any funds,\u201d Mr. Suleri said.Announced in 2012, the Zero Hunger Challenge comprises five elements: ending stunting in children under 2 years old; ensuring universal access to food year round; making all food systems sustainable; doubling the productivity and income of small landowners or workers; and ending food waste.Mr. Kharas, of the Brookings Institution, said a number of interrelated efforts were needed, including linking small-scale farmers to larger supply chains, bolstering international trade in food and expanding agricultural research.Ending hunger \u201cis an achievable goal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s only achievable if we do things a little bit differently from what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly at one point to the United Nations\u2019 role in the creation of the Zero Hunger Challenge program. As the article correctly noted in a later reference, the campaign was an initiative of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. It is not a campaign that the United Nations as a whole began in 2012.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Stagger to End of Rough Week", "Date": "2015-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stocks plunged on Friday, capping their worst week in years and prompting the perhaps inevitable question: Has the country\u2019s tremendous stock market rally finally come to an end?The benchmark Shanghai share index \u2014 which has more than doubled in the last year \u2014 fell 6.4 percent on Friday. From their peak a week earlier, Shanghai stocks have now lost 13.8 percent \u2014 their worst weekly decline in seven years. The main index for the Shenzhen stock market, which tends to include smaller, nonstate companies, fell 12.7 percent for the week.Although China\u2019s frothy markets have for months displayed signs of being in a bubble, naysayers have so far been proved wrong. Shanghai stocks have approached double-digit declines twice this year \u2014 both times in May \u2014 but quickly regained their footing to continue their ascent.Before the sell-off on Friday, mainland stocks had risen to nearly $10 trillion in market value, up from $3 trillion a year ago and second only to the value of stocks in the United States, in terms of overall size.So some analysts said it was too soon to assume the rally had run out of steam.\u201cI would say we are in for a very sharp, volatile correction,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief China strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s too early to say everything is finished and this is the peak.\u201dAt the same time, China\u2019s efforts at financial overhauls have helped lift its domestic stock markets \u2014 which are still broadly closed to foreign investors \u2014 onto the global stage.Analysts pointed to several factors that contributed to the sell-off this week. Among them was a large number of companies seeking initial public offerings in the mainland, which had the temporary effect of locking up about 5 trillion renminbi, or more than $810 billion, in investors\u2019 funds. Additionally, Monday is a public holiday in the mainland \u2014 the traditional Dragon Boat festival \u2014 and many investors probably sought to cash out of their riskier trades, given the recent market volatility.\u201cThe culprit of this very sharp correction is very high valuations and a very strong run-up in the market before this \u2014 this was an accident waiting to happen,\u201d Mr. Hong said.China\u2019s central bank has already cut interest rates three times since November, and most economists expect it to take some form of further easing action in the coming weeks or months. At the same time, the central bank is wary that such steps may simply end up inflating share prices. \u201cThere\u2019s not such the dichotomy between the real economy and stock market as we are sometimes led to believe by the debate in China,\u201d Louis Kuijs, the chief economist for greater China at Royal Bank of Scotland, said this week. \u201cBut definitely, policy makers have to be seen as not making things worse in terms of stimulating the stock market while the economy remains very weak.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protections for Late Investors Can Inflate Start-Up Valuations", "Date": "2015-06-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarning: Some unicorns may be smaller than they appear.The recent proliferation of so-called unicorns \u2014 start-up technology companies valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 has been greeted variously as a sign of healthy innovation or an indication that valuations have become dangerously overheated.Led by the likes of the car-hailing service Uber at $41 billion and the home-rental website Airbnb at $10 billion, the global ranks of unicorns have more than doubled, to 102, over the last 15 months, according to PitchBook Data, which tracks private financial markets.Less noticed is that the reported valuations of many unicorns have been inflated by the terms of the private investments that set those valuations before any initial public offerings of stock \u2014 often with little or no disclosure of those terms.Increasingly, venture investors say, late-stage financing terms include extra protections, like a discount to the price of any eventual initial offering, a minimum return on investment or extra shares if the company later raises money at a lower valuation.For example, the cloud software provider Box Inc. raised $150 million in July 2014 from two investors, Coatue Management and TPG Capital, at $20 a share \u2014 a reported valuation of $2.4 billion. Under terms of their investment, Coatue and TPG were entitled to receive additional shares if Box later went public at a lower price, and a 10 percent discount to the I.P.O. price to boot. When Box priced its initial offering at $14 a share in January, the lower price dropped the Coatue-TPG purchase price to $12.60 a share and increased the number of shares they received by 58 percent. Box\u2019s current stock market value is about $2.1 billion. Such protections, which Box disclosed because it had already filed plans to go public, are controversial among start-up investors. Early-stage investors warn they can jeopardize a company\u2019s financial stability, diluting the value of their original stakes and worsening a company\u2019s prospects in a downturn.But the protections appeal to company founders because they provide new cash at the highest nominal valuation, reducing dilution if all goes well. And later-stage investors argue that they provide valuable insurance.The protections, known among investors as structuring or ratcheting, can inflate a unicorn\u2019s indicated valuation 10 percent to 25 percent, according to Rick Kline, a lawyer at Goodwin Procter whose firm does legal work on start-up and initial offering financings. He said the phenomenon has been part of a general \u201cfrothiness\u201d in late-stage valuations.The cost of the extra insurance against a downturn \u2014 borne by the company and its other investors \u2014 effectively counts against the sale price and thus should reduce the valuation. But companies generally do not count such implied costs in reporting the valuations, venture investors say.The Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West recently analyzed 37 United States unicorns that raised money in the year ended March 31. It found that five of them promised to pay additional shares to late-stage investors if the companies\u2019 initial offerings were priced below their pre-I.P.O. investment valuations, and six others allowed the investors to block an offering below the price of their investment. Fenwick did not identify the companies.As a result, the firm said, about 30 percent of unicorn investors \u201chad significant protection against a down round I.P.O.\u201d The same report noted that one-third of the companies had valuations at or just above $1 billion, \u201cindicating that the companies may have negotiated specifically to attain the unicorn level.\u201dIn an interview, the report\u2019s co-author, Barry Kramer, noted that unicorns could also increase their reported valuation by increasing the number of shares in the option pool set aside for employees, even if those options have not been issued, much less exercised.Samuel Schwerin, managing partner of Millennium Technology Value Partners, which invests in mid- to late-stage technology start-ups, noted that some late-stage investors had sought such protections partly because many start-ups have gone public or subsequently traded at prices below those paid by late-stage investors.Venture capitalists invest in companies in search of breakout hits. These rarities, called unicorns, have grown in size and number as investors chasing returns have bid up their value.Since the start of 2014, Mr. Schwerin noted, 11 technology companies have priced their initial offerings below the investment price of the last financing rounds before the offerings. In addition to Box, they include the software providers Apigee and Globant and the big-data manager Hortonworks. Mr. Schwerin also estimated that more than two-fifths of venture-backed technology companies had fallen below their initial offering price in the same period.Like Box, Globant also gave late-stage investors price protection, although it expired before Globant\u2019s initial offering, and its stock price has since doubled from its offering price. The developments in late-stage financing have taken on greater importance as more companies stay private longer, allowing their valuations to blossom before public investors have a chance to get in on the action.During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, companies often went public within a few years of being founded, and their stock prices doubled or tripled soon after their initial public offerings. Now, a greater share of such gains is being reaped by investors before the offering.As a result, the amount of money flowing into late-stage investing has swollen, and the value of such investments has sometimes ballooned as unicorn valuations have shot up. Wellington Management, for one, is raising a fund devoted to late-stage investments.But recent losses have made some investors more cautious. One investing partner at a big venture capital firm, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussions on the matter, said there was a \u201csea change\u201d in requests for protection by late-stage investors after some suffered temporary paper losses at several companies like Hortonworks, which went public in December, and the home-goods shopping website Wayfair, which had an I.P.O. in October. Mr. Schwerin, whose firm decided two years ago to proceed more cautiously in making new investments because of prevailing high valuations, said, \u201cOnly time will tell whether providing companies with such monster valuations in exchange for such sophisticated structures\u201d is a good idea.Companies are also considered more likely to grant such protection if their path to profitability or a successful initial offering is less assured. That was the case with Box, which was burning through cash at the time of its $150 million fund-raising in mid-2014.Investors are reluctant to discuss their arrangements, and those that did spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize their relationships with the companies.Among current pre-I.P.O. start-ups, Uber has offered to sell stock at a discount of 20 percent to 30 percent of an eventual offering price to investors that participated in a $1.6 billion debt financing led by Goldman Sachs in January, according to Bloomberg News. And it gave minimum-return protection to at least one investor, TPG, in mid-2013, two investors said.Lynda.com, an online learning company, also gave protection to investors led by TPG in raising $186 million in January at a valuation of nearly $1 billion, one investor said. LinkedIn agreed to acquire Lynda.com in April for $1.5 billion. A LinkedIn spokesman declined to comment.And one fantasy sports site, FanDuel, is negotiating a late-stage round that may also include investor protections, two investors said. A FanDuel spokeswoman said she could not discuss any funding details. \u201cI think entrepreneurs get starry-eyed about the high valuations and don\u2019t realize they come with all sorts of caveats if everything doesn\u2019t work perfectly,\u201d said Daniel Ciporin, a venture capital investor at Canaan Partners.Neeraj Agrawal, a general partner at Battery Ventures, said such structures work for companies when, \u201clike \u2018The Lego Movie\u2019 theme song, everything is awesome.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthings won\u2019t always be awesome, and when they aren\u2019t, a company can blow up over this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A rout in European bonds continued.The Shanghai composite index closed nearly 1 percent higher, despite having slid more than 5 percent in the course of trading on Thursday. The index has gained a remarkable 53 percent thus far in 2015.That fluctuation carried into Europe, where the Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chips fell 1.5 percent in midday trading only to rally to roughly unchanged in the afternoon, while the FTSE 100 index in London had given up 0.7 percent by the afternoon.In New York, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.2 percent in midmorning trading. The S.&P. 500 had gained about 0.4 percent the day before.While the wild ride in Chinese stocks was the most visible sign of market volatility on Thursday, uncertainty over Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors also weighed on European stocks.The creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2014 \u201chave been kicking the can down the road for a very long time,\u201d Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, said on Thursday. \u201cBut they don\u2019t seem to have made much progress, and there are some deadlines ahead.\u201dBig swings in prices, he said, are to be expected when interest rates are very low. And he emphasized that the central bank would continue a plan announced in March to buy 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, of government bonds and other debt each month through September 2016 as part of an economic stimulus program.Investors on Thursday were selling off European bonds. Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to bond prices, reached astonishingly low levels this year in the eurozone, as investors sought safe assets amid expectations of poor growth and fears that deflation would take hold in the euro currency bloc.But the bond rally has reversed as the eurozone economy has gathered momentum faster than many market watchers had expected, and as deflation fears have ebbed. The yield on German government 10-year debt, the eurozone benchmark, is back around 0.8 percent, after having fallen almost to zero.Investors who bought 10-year Italian and Spanish bonds, so-called peripheral eurozone debt, pushed yields down to lows of around 1.1 percent in March. On Thursday, those bonds had yields closer to 2 percent.\u201cYou can no longer justify yields near zero on 10-years,\u201d Mr. Gijsels said. As a result, investors who bought in at a time of low yields are now rushing for the exits to avoid losses.Mr. Gijsels said investors were also nervous about the May jobs report for the United States, due to be released Friday morning in Washington. Because recent data has not given a clear indication of the direction of the American economy, he said, markets will be closely watching the unemployment report for indications of how soon the Federal Reserve plans to begin raising interest rates from their current levels, near zero.\u201cWe\u2019re in a perverse world where bad news is good news for the market,\u201d he said, because a weak jobs report \u201cwould mean that rates stayed low.\u201dThe dollar fell early Thursday against most other major currencies but recovered slightly in afternoon trading. The euro was a touch higher at $1.1283. The dollar was steady against the Japanese currency at around 124.5 yen.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Climate Change Calls for Science, Not Hope", "Date": "2015-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneNow, environmental experts are suggesting that some parts of the strategy are, at best, a waste of money and time. At worst, they are setting the United States in the wrong direction entirely.Efficiency gains are also critical. The Obama administration\u2019s plan for the electricity generating industry has not been completed yet. But the E.P.A.\u2019s original proposal estimated that energy efficiency would account for almost one-fifth of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.Mr. Lovins, a longtime advocate of investment in energy efficiency, argues that such targets are easily achievable. \u201cThere is a lot of cheap efficiency to be bought out there,\u201d he told me.But forecasts like his must contend with the fact that worldwide improvements in energy efficiency are slowing. While there may be great investment opportunities, residential retrofits do not seem to fit the bill.What this evidence suggests is that climate change strategies too often lack strong analytical foundations, and are driven more by hope than science. Policy makers would be making a mistake to proceed as if their favored methods are working, when the data shows they aren\u2019t.The task of replacing the world\u2019s entire energy system within the next few decades requires experimenting intensely along many technological avenues, learning quickly from failures and moving on. Yet too often the goal of bringing the world\u2019s carbon emissions under control is put at the service of other agendas, ideological or economic, limiting the world\u2019s options.The pope sees in climate change an opportunity to reform humanity\u2019s ways. So he called on the world to address the challenge by tempering overconsumption. In so doing, however, his encyclical deprived people of the tools humanity will need to prevent climatic upheaval.\u201cWe need to look at it as a program of carbon management, not of reforming society,\u201d said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.Michael Greenstone, who runs the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and was one of the authors of the energy efficiency study, puts that in practical terms. \u201cThere is a limited appetite to devote resources to mitigating carbon emissions, so we should aim to pursue the least expensive ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk that we do a bunch of policies that make us feel better about ourselves but do not hit the climate target directly.\u201d\u201cPeople are taking things off the table that historically have worked, and only putting things on the table that are untried,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.He welcomes investment in newfangled renewable energy, but argues for much more experimentation with nuclear power, too. Powering an entire grid with the wind and sun, he notes, requires building generation capacity to satisfy peak demand many times over, to keep the lights on when the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun is down. Or it requires a fossil-fuel-based backup grid with the capacity to satisfy 100 percent of peak demand.The King Canute strategy cannot protect us and our children from climate change. We need experimentation that will deliver genuine breakthroughs. And that requires putting wishful thinking and phobias aside and letting science guide the way.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Loan Deadline Looming, Europe Offers Greece a Last-Minute Deal", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith only a day left before Greece\u2019s current bailout package expires and the deadline arrives for a loan repayment of about $1.8 billion, alarm that it might miss the payment and eventually crash out of the group of 19 countries that use the euro prompted a flurry of statements from Brussels and major European leaders. They mixed reassurance and rebukes directed at Greece\u2019s left-wing government with grave warnings that Europe\u2019s future was at stake.Late Monday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Union\u2019s executive branch, offered the Greek prime minister, Alex Tsipras, a last-minute proposal that offered the possibility of a concession on demands for cuts in bonus payments for the poorest pensioners, European officials said. In return, however, Mr. Tsipras would have to accept all of the other creditors\u2019 demands, which he had already turned down, and request an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday.Greek officials said they had received Mr. Juncker\u2019s proposal but did not say how the government would respond. In an interview on Greek state television\u00a0on Monday\u00a0night, Mr. Tsipras strongly suggested that Greece would not make the payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, and seemed to express surprise that the fund expected to be paid. \u201cHow is it possible the creditors are waiting for the I.M.F. payment while our banks are being asphyxiated?\u201d he said. \u201cIf they decide to stop the asphyxiation, the installments will be paid.\u201dIn Athens, thousands of demonstrators, encouraged by the governing Syriza party, gathered in Syntagma Square, waving flags, banging drums and chanting against austerity.Some analysts warned Monday that the tussle could drag into late July, when Greece owes the European Central Bank \u20ac3.5 billion for purchases of Greek government bonds.\u201cThe real hard stop for the Greek government is the E.C.B.\u2019s repayment on July 20,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.While insisting that Greece must stay within Europe\u2019s common currency and the 28-nation European Union, Mr. Juncker displayed the depth of anger in Brussels and elsewhere at Greece\u2019s leftist government, complaining earlier Monday that he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Athens and that negotiations were \u201cnot a game of liar\u2019s poker.\u201dPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France assured Greece and financial markets that an agreement was still possible and that Paris wanted Greece to stay in the euro, while also assuring the French public that it would be safe from the turbulence that shook Europe four years ago, when it last looked as if Greece might drop out of the euro.France, Mr. Hollande said in a statement, \u201chas nothing to fear from what could happen.\u201dAn aide to the French president, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic matters, said Mr. Hollande had spoken by telephone with President Obama. \u201cThey agreed to pool their efforts to facilitate a resumption of the talks so as to find a solution to the crisis as soon as possible and ensure Greece\u2019s financial stability,\u201d the aide said.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Ms. Merkel, at a news conference in her chancellery in Berlin after meeting with Germany\u2019s political leaders, said Greece, by interrupting talks and deciding on a referendum, had shown no willingness to compromise.It was clear from her demeanor and her meetings with the party leaders that Ms. Merkel did not want Greece to leave the euro or to see European unity fail.Mr. Juncker, looking to avoid responsibility in the event of a rupture between Greece and Europe, accused Mr. Tsipras of acting in bad faith. \u201cAll elements were on the table,\u201d he said in Brussels. But, he added, Mr. Tsipras \u201cleft the talks at the worst moment\u201d and without warning.In an unusually blunt critique of a member government, Mr. Juncker said Mr. Tsipras\u2019s negotiating tactics were \u201cnot worthy of the great Greek nation.\u201dFrom a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.Ms. Merkel, who has been in power almost a decade and has been criticized in the Greek crisis for rigidly advocating austerity, advised against appearing to tell the Greeks how to vote. \u201cThey are mature citizens\u201d and can make up their own minds, she said, calling the crisis a \u201cdecisive challenge\u201d for Europe.Europe is better equipped to deal with that challenge than it was a few years ago, she added, voicing confidence that the euro was stable and secure.Sigmar Gabriel, head of Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, said European unity was facing its greatest crisis in 60 years. He stopped short, however, of echoing calls from the German opposition for heads of state and government to meet as soon as possible. He stressed that Greece was not the only crisis facing Europe and cited the flow of migrants and the rise of nationalist movements.\u201cEurope cannot give permanent financial aid with no conditions,\u201d he said.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, Aurelien Breeden from Paris, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Fall Into a Bear Market", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Like a growing number of other investors, Wang Jiacang, a 48-year-old driver in Beijing, is caught in the falling Chinese stock market with no easy exit.Chinese rules halt trading in a company\u2019s shares when they drop 10 percent, and some of the more speculative listings declined by the limit on Friday and again on Monday, while giving investors like Mr. Wang few chances to sell. \u201cI\u2019m quite worried \u2014 a fifth of my investment has been trapped,\u201d he said. \u201cWho will buy stocks in a bear market?\u201dThe markets gyrated on Monday from initial gains of more than 3 percent, in response to the central bank\u2019s action, to losses of more than 7 percent by early afternoon. The Shanghai market closed with a loss of 3.3 percent, while the especially volatile Shenzhen market plunged 6.1 percent. The losses pushed both stock exchanges into bear markets, with stock prices declining more than 20 percent since their peak on June 12. Much of those losses came in just the last two trading days, as indexes at both exchanges fell more than 7 percent on Friday.Heavy losses among individual investors pose an economic and financial dilemma for the government and possibly a political challenge as well, if unhappy speculators start protesting that the government should do more to help the market.Even with Monday\u2019s losses, Chinese stock markets have doubled in the past year. Much of that increase has stemmed from a series of signals from the government that it wanted buoyant stock markets. The official Xinhua news agency even produced a prominently distributed analysis on Sunday that the markets remained healthy and sound.As the markets have sunk, they have begun to take a heavy toll on the many investors who borrowed much of the money that they eagerly invested in what had seemed like a robust bull market. Mr. Wang said that one of his friends, who owns his own company, had lost all of his accumulated earnings from years of stock market investments and half the principal that he originally put into the market.\u201cHe almost wants to kill himself,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cI asked him out Saturday. He didn\u2019t come out. He was lying at home, listless.\u201dMarket strategists and economists have had varying views on the reasons behind the Chinese stock market rally that lasted through mid-June. Some have suggested it was underpinned by a genuine and sustainable increase in demand for Chinese shares, as interest rates have been falling, the stumbling real estate market has seemed unappealing and households have had lots of cash in bank deposits paying just 2 percent interest.Moreover, China has been in discussions with companies managing the leading international stock indexes on when its shares might be included in those indexes. When that occurs international money managers will need to pump tens of billions of dollars into mainland Chinese stocks or else risk having their investment returns diverge substantially from the best-known benchmarks.But skeptics have suggested for months that China\u2019s soaring share prices were really a case of pure speculation. They point out that China\u2019s economic growth rate has been steadily slowing. Many corporations, particularly state-owned enterprises, are struggling to make timely interest payments on their heavy debts. Wages are rising steeply, pinching corporate profit margins, because of a shrinking supply of young workers, a result of increasingly stringent enforcement of the \u201cone child\u201d demographic policy through the 1990s.Why the Chinese stock markets finally peaked and began descending is also the subject of vigorous debate. Some have suggested that the market was so high that a drop was inevitable. Others point out that an easing of regulations on home purchases has started to kindle a recovery in prices of apartments, the main alternative to investing in stocks.Almost no one thinks that the Chinese markets\u2019 troubles reflect issues in Europe or elsewhere. \u201cI do not believe the situation in Greece has that big an impact on the mainland stock market,\u201d said Andy Wong, a longtime Hong Kong stockbroker.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 2.6 percent on Monday and had smaller losses last week. The city\u2019s more sophisticated investors did not bet as heavily on a bull market over the past year, as the Hang Seng lagged considerably behind mainland indexes. But that has left Hong Kong investors less perturbed by recent losses.\u201cYou would think that with the rate cuts, the markets would go up,\u201d said Alice Yam, a 55-year-old office worker. \u201cAnyway, I am not afraid of this volatility. There is a Chinese saying: If you choose to eat salted fish, you should be prepared to withstand the subsequent thirst.\u201dPatrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahold-Delhaize Deal Would Create One of Largest Grocery Chains in U.S.", "Date": "2015-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe merger agreement between the Dutch supermarket operator Ahold and the Delhaize Group of Belgium on Wednesday reflected yet another sign of the malaise hanging over the grocery business in the United States.While the deal would, if approved, create one of the largest supermarket operators in the United States, marrying Delhaize\u2019s Food Lion and Hannaford chains to Stop & Shop and Giant stores owned by Ahold, the move followed a string of grocery store mergers and a burst of new competitors across the United States.With the companies generating roughly two-thirds of their sales in the United States, their merger is expected to help them compete better with Safeway and Albertson\u2019s, which recently merged, and with Walmart Stores, which has the largest grocery business in the country.The grocery business historically is one of razor-thin profit margins, and in the last decade, mainstream grocers have faced greater competition from warehouse stores that sell in bulk like Costco and retailers like Walmart and Target that have melded grocery operations with a broader product mix. Then, too, dollar stores, convenience stores, private label-based discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe\u2019s, and even higher-priced \u201cnatural\u201d foods stores like Whole Foods and Sprouts, have cut into traditional grocery sales.Thus, over the last three years, Spartan Stores has merged with Nash Finch and Safeway with Albertson\u2019s, while Kroger has bought Harris Teeter.\u201dAll this activity is a product of what is just a very flat business in terms of sales growth,\u201d said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of the consumer analytics firm TABS. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grow the top line, you need to find synergies and efficiencies that will help the bottom line.\u201dSome privately held regional chains, like Wegmans and H-E-B, however, are holding their own.Under the deal, the combined company would be called Ahold Delhaize and would be worth about 26.2 billion euros, or about $29.5 billion, based on market capitalization. It would have more than 6,500 stores and 375,000 employees in the United States and Europe, and sales of \u20ac54.1 billion.Ahold and Delhaize said they expected \u20ac500 million in annual cost savings by the third year after the transaction, after taking one-time charges of about \u20ac350 million. The two companies\u2019 stores have little overlap, but they will be able to save money through shared advertising and promotions and consolidating distribution and warehousing.Such cost savings, rather than consolidation, are driving mergers in the industry, said Meredith Adler, an investment analyst at Barclays, noting that, at the same time, new grocery chains are appearing. Walmart has been introducing smaller, grocery-only stores called Neighborhood Market, and Whole Foods recently announced plans to open a chain of stores to appeal to more budget-conscious consumers.\u201cThere have been some transactions, yes, but they seem to be really logical for the most part,\u201d Ms. Adler said. \u201cThese companies seems to have thought hard about how the companies fit strategically and what they can achieve in terms of efficiencies and synergies.\u201dSuch synergies will not extend to putting a single name, or banner, on all of the stores, an Ahold spokesman said.And Ms Adler said, \u201cThere is lots of evidence that to really do it right, you want to keep the individual identities conveyed by the different banners since there\u2019s often great loyalty to the banners among customers.\u201d She added, \u201cThe challenge is then to get the benefits of scale and efficiency that come with being one company without harming those individual identities.\u201dIn the first quarter, pricing pressure cut into Ahold\u2019s margins in the United States, with net sales dropping about 2 percent, to \u20ac7 billion, and Food Lion, which once sprawled to Texas and Florida, has really struggled. \u201cIf you look at their market share, it\u2019s still very low, other than in North Carolina, where its heritage is,\u201d Mr. Jetta said.He said Food Lion\u2019s attempt to institute an \u201ceveryday low pricing\u201d strategy to compete with Walmart also had fallen flat, as it deprived the chain of the ability to use promotions to attract customers.A bright spot among the two companies\u2019 businesses is Ahold\u2019s grocery delivery service, Peapod, which is one of the largest. But those types of businesses, which include FreshDirect and Amazon Fresh, account for just a tiny sliver of the overall grocery market.Delhaize shareholders would receive 4.75 shares of Ahold for each share of Delhaize they own. Ahold shareholders would own 61 percent of the combined company, while Delhaize shareholders would own the remaining 39 percent.Ahold said it would terminate its continuing share buyback program, return about \u20ac1 billion to shareholders and conduct a reverse stock split before the deal closes.Shares of Ahold fell about 1.3 percent to \u20ac18.70 in trading in Amsterdam on Wednesday, while shares of Delhaize declined about 5 percent to \u20ac83.42 in trading in Brussels.The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close in mid-2016. The boards of each company have unanimously recommended that shareholders support the deal.If the merger is completed, Mr. Jansson, the Delhaize chairman, would be chairman of Ahold Delhaize, and Dick Boer, the Ahold chief executive, would continue in that role at the combined company.Mr. Hommen, the Ahold chairman, and Jacques de Vaucleroy, a Delhaize director, would serve as vice chairmen.Frans Muller, the Delhaize chief executive, would serve as deputy chief executive and chief integration officer.The merged company would be based in the Netherlands, with its European head office in Brussels.In a research note on Wednesday, Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the potential cost savings were \u201csensible\u201d but expressed concerns about the potential execution risk because similar large-scale mergers in the food sector have not succeeded. The Albertson\u2019s-Safeway merger, in particular, has been difficult, according to analysts.\u201cOn initial inspection the deal looks good for Ahold shareholders, they are getting \u20ac1 billion in cash and paying only a 27 percent premium for Delhaize, well below some of the initial estimates,\u201d Mr. Monteyne wrote.Ahold, which is based in Zaandam, the Netherlands, operates about 3,200 stores in Europe and the United States and employs 227,000 people. It posted sales of \u20ac32.8 billion in 2014. The company\u2019s brands include Albert Heijn in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands; Etos in the Netherlands; and Albert in the Czech Republic.Delhaize, which is based in Brussels, operates about 3,400 stores in the United States, Europe and Asia and employs 150,000 people. The company posted sales of \u20ac21.4 billion in 2014. Its brands include Tempo in southeastern Europe and Super Indo in Indonesia.Ahold was advised by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and by the law firms Allen & Overy and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Delhaize was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Lazard, and by the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Linklaters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mergers Might Not Signal Optimism ", "Date": "2015-06-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookA boom in mergers and acquisitions usually signals confidence in the economy, and recent headline-grabbing deals evoke images of chief executives and directors cheering about their business prospects and overall growth.So far this year, deal-making activity in the United States has topped $775.8 billion, up nearly 50 percent compared with figures in the period last year, just behind deal volume in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters. A steady parade of multibillion-dollar deals have been announced: Charter Communications\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Teva Pharmaceuticals\u2019s $40 billion hostile bid for Mylan and Avago Technologies\u2019s $37 billion takeover of Broadcom are among them.But in contrast to previous merger booms, this recent spate of deals shouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered a barometer of a healthy economy. If anything, it might be an indicator of the troubles that lie beneath an overheated stock market.In many cases, companies are pursuing takeovers not because they are excited about a growing economy, but because their own growth prospects have waned.The numbers tell the story: Revenue growth at United States companies has declined every year for the last five years, to about 5 percent now from 11.2 percent in 2010, according to a report by Citigroup. The bank put the problem bluntly: \u201cMany companies will therefore require a source of inorganic growth to meet analyst revenue projections.\u201dIf you can\u2019t build it, then maybe you can buy it.Mergers and acquisitions have always, to some degree, been a way for companies that are struggling to grow to purchase revenue. But top-line growth for most American companies has been particularly hard to come by in recent years, and to the extent that businesses have been able to continue to increase their profits, it\u2019s been largely a function of cutting costs. That differs significantly from other economic rebounds in which merger volume has tracked increases in revenue.According to the Citigroup report, \u201cstrategic actions, such as M.&A. and asset restructurings, have become a key priority to generate growth in the current environment. The lack of an organic impetus to growth is apparent in the outlook for capital expenditures.\u201d The report said \u201cglobally, growth in capital expenditures rose sharply from 5 percent in 2010 to almost 19 percent in 2011 following the financial crisis but has decelerated every year since, reaching 4.6 percent in 2013. Over the next 12 months, the forecasted capital expenditure growth is below 2 percent globally.\u201dEven among the current crop of deals, there is little expectation of huge jumps in revenue growth. Charter Communications\u2019s news release for its deal with Time Warner Cable was completely devoid of any revenue projection, as was Avago\u2019s announcement of its deal for Broadcom.Indeed, cost-cutting continues to be one of the chief rationales in recent deals. \u201cSynergy,\u201d an overused word in deal-making, has returned as \u201csavings.\u201dCompanies also may be turning to deals as buying back shares, another method for managing earnings per share, runs its course.\u201cTactically, repurchases may lift share prices in the near term, but in our view it is a questionable use of cash at the current time when the P./E. multiple of the market is so high,\u201d David J. Kostin, the chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients, referring to the price-earnings ratio. \u201cManagements are often poor market timers. In 2007, companies allocated more than one-third of their cash use to buybacks ($637 billion) just before the S.&P. 500 plunged by 40 percent during the following year. Conversely, at the bottom of the market in 2009, firms devoted just 13 percent of their annual cash spending to repurchases ($146 billion).\u201dIf share buybacks are becoming too expensive, does that mean acquisition prices are getting too heady as well?Maybe.Still, Mr. Kostin says, \u201cFirms should focus on M.&A. rather than pursue buybacks at a time when P./E. multiples are so high.\u201d He recommends that companies use equity to pay for deals. The problem with Mr. Kostin\u2019s argument is that companies are sitting on trillions of dollars in cash and can still borrow money inexpensively. In all likelihood, another spurt of deals is in the offing over the summer, ahead of expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as soon as the fall.Shareholders seem to agree with Mr. Kostin \u2014 or are looking the other way about the potential for problems. Of 74 deals that Citigroup has classified as transformational since 2011, it found that the buyer\u2019s stock price appreciated by 1.5 percent. \u201cHistorically, the market reaction to large M.&A. transactions has been mixed in the short term. However, since 2011, transformational transactions have been met with share price appreciation around their announcement.\u201dBut as deal-making appears to move ahead with a full head of steam, with the blessing of investors, no one should mistake it for a vote of confidence in a robust economy.

Rather, it wants to preserve the integrity of its game.After the league clarified its rules, Bo Brownstein, the founder of the Fantasy Sports Combine, which will hold its own event next month in Las Vegas, removed several players, including Brandon Marshall and Von Miller, from its program.\u201cIt\u2019s not a popular position, but they are protecting a major business,\u201d Brownstein said of the N.F.L.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest hypocrisy in sports,\u201d said Scott Andresen, a sports and entertainment lawyer who teaches at Northwestern. \u201cThe N.F.L. and other leagues are in opposition to legalized sports gambling because they haven\u2019t quite figured out how to monetize it. Once they do, they\u2019ll all be on board.\u201dAndresen and other critics note that the N.F.L. already does business with casinos, and contend that trying to keep players from working in casinos is impossible because gambling and gamblers are everywhere. As Andresen put it: \u201cMobsters can travel, too.\u201dSports leagues have long wrestled with how to keep gamblers at bay while also making money for their owners. Leagues bar players from working at or with a casino, yet those same casinos advertise in stadiums around the country. All but five N.F.L. teams play in markets where legal casinos operate, according to Sara Rayme, a spokeswoman for the American Gaming Association.\u201cIt is only a matter of time before such thinking in organizations like the N.F.L. evolves and acknowledges the reality that gaming, like professional sports, is a form of mainstream entertainment,\u201d she said in a statement.\u201cWe generate a lot more fan engagement,\u201d said Jason Robins, the chief executive of DraftKings, which runs daily fantasy tournaments and has deals with five N.F.L. teams. Fans, he said, watch \u201cblowouts on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 because it could affect their fantasy scores.\u201dThe league\u2019s measured approach may be because daily fantasy, in which players draft lineups whenever there is a new slate of games, is closer to gambling than seasonlong fantasy. Some have compared the games to day trading and investing.Both, ultimately, are betting on stocks, which is why some fans view fantasy football as no worse than playing poker in a casino or in a basement with friends. That logic will continue to ensnare the N.F.L.\u201cYou have this space that can both positively and negatively affect your brand,\u201d said Craig Amazeen, senior vice president at Scout, a digital sports network and the home of the Official Fantasy Football World Championships. \u201cThey are trying to dance on a dance floor, but the boundaries of the floor keep changing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But when it comes to average investors, regulators want more safeguards in place. An earlier version of the Regulation A rule allowed companies to raise up to $5 million from nonaccredited investors \u2014 but it required those companies to first file an extensive, financially detailed offering document, subject to review by the S.E.C. and regulators in every state in which securities would be sold.More than 22,000 companies used Regulation D last year to raise money from investors. Only seven jumped through all the hoops to use Regulation A.But some entrepreneurs say they do consider it necessary, for either financial or philosophical reasons.Mr. Harrington is a serial entrepreneur who made a fortune as an infomercial pioneer and gained fame by appearing as an investor in the first two seasons of \u201cShark Tank,\u201d in which entrepreneurs compete for financial backing. StarShop, based in New York, opened for business just weeks ago, but he is already envisioning its long-term future: \u201cThis is a business that will require tens of millions of dollars in funding if we\u2019re going to build a billion-dollar company,\u201d he said.He could try to raise that money the traditional way, from venture capitalists and large investors \u2014 Sprint already owns a minority stake in the business \u2014 but Mr. Harrington is a populist who likes the idea of having a broad network of investors.\u201cWhen I did segments on \u2018Shark Tank,\u2019 I would get texts from people saying, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you invest in that company!? You should have done that deal!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to be a shark. If we have a huge base of small owners, they become very vocal about their involvement in StarShop, and they can spread the word.\u201dRegulation A deals will not be fast, or cheap. Kendall Almerico, the lawyer preparing StarShop\u2019s paperwork, says a typical company will need to spend $50,000 to $100,000 on legal, accounting and filing fees. Every offering must be reviewed by and gain approval from the S.E.C., a process that takes more than 300 days, on average.Living on the outskirts of the Bay Area, Mr. Paisley is surrounded by venture firms and private investors, but they are not interested in slow-growth, midtier businesses like his.Mr. Paisley plans to market his offering with a direct-mail campaign to thousands of lawyers and paralegals, the kinds of potential investors he thinks will understand his business and its prospects.Like Mr. Harrington, he is hoping to find a few patient, enthusiastic sharks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panic Sets in Among Hardy Hedge Fund Investors Remaining in Greece", "Date": "2015-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 For investors around the world looking at Greece, there was but one question Sunday: What is going to happen when the markets open?On Sunday night, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said in a televised address that Greece\u2019s banks and stock market would be closed on Monday, as Athens tries to avert a financial collapse.Through the weekend, Nicholas L. Papapolitis, a corporate lawyer here, was working round the clock comforting and cajoling his frantic hedge fund clients.\u201cPeople are freaking out,\u201d said Mr. Papapolitis, 32, his eyes red and his voice hoarse. \u201cThey have made some really big bets on Greece.But there is no getting around the truth of the matter, he said. Without a deal with its European creditors, the country will default and Greek stocks and bonds will tank when the markets open.Panicky depositors spent the weekend pulling an estimated one billion euros from the banking system, stashing the cash in their houses or exchanging them for bulging bags of gold coins.The yields on Greek government bonds, now around 12 percent, are expected to soar as investors rush to unload their positions in a market that of late has become extremely hard to trade.There are not as many hedge funds in Greece as there were a year ago, when it is estimated that around 100 foreign funds were sitting on big investment stakes. Their bet was that the previous Greek government would be able to complete the arduous process of economic reform in Greece that started five years ago.When it became clear that a radical Syriza government under Mr. Tsipras would come to power, many investors quickly turned heel, dumping their Greek government bonds and bank stocks in large numbers before and after the election.But a brave, hardy few stayed put \u2014 around 40 to 50, local brokers estimate \u2014 taking the view that while the new left-wing government could hardly be described as investor friendly, it would ultimately agree to a deal with Europe. It would be a bumpy ride for sure, but for those taking the long view that Greece would remain in the eurozone, holding on to their investments as opposed to selling them in a panic seemed the better course of action.For now, at least, that seems to be a terrible misjudgment, especially if Greece defaults and leaves the euro.Most of the hedge fund money in Greece is invested in about 30 billion euros of freshly minted Greek government debt securities that emerged from the 2012 restructuring of private sector bonds.The largest investors include Japonica Partners in Rhode Island, the French investment funds H20 and Carmignac, and an assortment of other hedge funds like Farallon, Fortress, York Capital, Baupost, Knighthead and Greylock Capital. A number of hedge funds have also made big bets on Greek banks, despite their thin levels of capital and nonperforming loans of around 50 percent of assets.Big positions have also been taken in some of Greece\u2019s largest companies. Fortress Capital bought $100 million in discounted debt belonging to Attica Holdings, Greece\u2019s largest ferryboat holder. York Capital has taken a 10 percent stake in GEK Terna, a prominent Greek construction and energy firm.In 2014, Blackstone\u2019s credit arm bought a 10 percent chunk of the Greek real estate developer Lamda Development. And Third Point, one of the earliest, most successful investors in Greek government bonds, has set up a $750 million Greek equity fund.Many of these forays were made during the heady days of 2013 and early 2014, when the view was that, in a rock bottom global interest rate environment, risky Greek assets looked attractive, especially if the reform process continued.Among the most dubious of these was a 10 percent equity stake, then worth about $137 million, that Mr. Paulson\u2019s hedge fund took last year in the Athens water monopoly. The company had little debt and was set to be privatized, making it an attractive prospect at the time.But the privatization process is now frozen and the monopoly is struggling to collect payment on its bills from government entities that are nearly broke, making it unlikely that Mr. Paulson will get much of his money back.To be sure, many of these hedge funds are enormous, and their Greek investments represent a fairly small slice of their overall portfolio.Mr. Papapolitis, who used to work at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York structuring exotic real estate deals, moved back to Greece in 2008 and has led some of the biggest hedge fund deals in the market.Of the same age and generation as many of his clients, he feels their pain.\u201cThese guys are my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cThey invested in Greece when the economy was improving. And now this happens \u2014 I feel obliged to be there for them.\u201dHe is not the only point man for hedge funds coming to Greece.Last week, a group of about 12 of the largest remaining hedge funds arrived in Athens to attend a seminar organized by George Linatsas, a founding partner of Axia Ventures, an investment bank that specializes in Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Italy, as well as shipping.With all the large investment banks and law firms having largely given up on Greece, Mr. Linatsas and his team of analysts became the main port of call for hedge funds that started buying Greek government bonds in 2012.Then, the bonds were trading at 12 cents on the euro and they soon shot up to 60 cents, making billions of dollars for those early investors.\u201cPeople made their careers on that trade,\u201d Mr. Linatsas said. \u201cThe problem now is politics and whether there is a government that can take this country to the next stage.\u201dThe outlook seems grim.Indeed, in recent months these investors have spent little time breaking down balance sheets or discounting cash flows. Instead, they have spent every effort trying to figure out what the Syriza government is up to.Some have tried to get an edge by listening to Greek radio. Others have hired firms to study video clips of Mr. Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to try and discern whether they are telling the truth. And an increasing number have resorted to begging journalists for inside scuttlebutt.Because few Syriza officials will meet with the investors, a large number of them have banded together, an unusual occurrence in an industry that puts the highest of premiums on secrecy. They exchange tips and theories via emails when they are apart and over wine-soaked dinners in Athens during their frequent trips here.At times, the swankiest hotel in town, the Hotel Grande Bretagne (or G.B. as it is commonly known) is so full of hedge fund executives (mostly in their 30s) that some have called it the G.G.B. \u2014 the acronym for Greek government bonds.In recent days, as it was becoming clear that the Syriza government was not going to accept the latest proposal from its creditors, stress and anxiety, in some cases, turned to outright anger.\u201cI just can\u2019t believe these guys are willing to torch their own country,\u201d one investor with a large holding of Greek bonds lamented in an email. \u201cThey thought this was a game. Now, when the supermarkets run out of food, gas stations run out of gas, hospitals have no medicine, tourists flee, salaries don\u2019t get paid because banks shut \u2014 what are they going to do?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norway Will Divest From Coal in Push Against Climate Change", "Date": "2015-06-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParliament voted Friday to order the fund to shift its holdings out of billions of dollars of stock in companies whose businesses rely at least 30 percent on coal. A committee vote last week made Friday\u2019s decision all but a formality; it will take effect next year.There is no question that the decision by various funds to sell fossil fuel stocks has little or no impact on the vast market capitalization of most companies. For that reason, the divestment movement has long been dismissed by many institutions, especially oil companies, as symbolic.But divestment decisions from funds like Norway\u2019s are important because they require, as a first step, discussions that once seemed taboo, said Bob Massie, a longtime climate activist and a founder of the Investor Network on Climate Risk, an organization of institutional investors affiliated with the business environmental group Ceres.\u201cIt lays the groundwork for the transformation of cultural and political views in a major topic that people would rather avoid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis requires people to say, \u2018What are we going to do? What are our choices? What do we believe in?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDivesting from the economically battered coal industry is a more selective move than a broad action against all fossil fuels, of course. But Jamie Henn, a co-founder of 350.org, a group that has promoted divestment, said that coal was the most environmentally damaging fossil fuel, and that the various divestment decisions \u201csend a clear political signal that we think will hasten the industry\u2019s inevitable decline \u2014 and push governments to take broader action.\u201dMarthe Skaar, a spokeswoman for Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the huge Norwegian fund, said its goal was \u201csafeguarding and building financial wealth for future generations in Norway.\u201d Its reasons for divesting include \u201clong-established climate-change risk-management expectations,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s 30 percent threshold for divestment applies to whether a company\u2019s business is based on coal, as in mining companies, or the percentage of its revenue that comes from coal. The second category would include power companies that burn coal.Norway\u2019s decision underscores its ambivalence about fossil fuels. The fund itself is nicknamed the \u201coil fund\u201d because its wealth comes from the nation\u2019s oil and gas revenues. But proponents of the move say that it helps prevent Norway from compounding the environmental damage that its own production causes by investing in environmentally destructive companies.Svein Flatten, a member of Parliament from the Conservative Party, said that lawmakers acted because investments in coal companies have \u201cboth financial risks and climate risks.\u201d He added, however, that this was not a step toward any other action. \u201cThe fund shall not be, and they really are not, a tool for political purposes,\u201d he said.\u201cWe actually don\u2019t have any investments in coal, but to make an announcement of that type didn\u2019t seem terribly useful,\u201d he said. Dr. Oxtoby, a climate researcher, called the divestment activism a distraction from efforts that could bring about real change, such as getting government to tax oil and gas to reduce consumption.Norway\u2019s decision, Dr. Oxtoby said, is similarly symbolic \u2014 especially when compared with the kind of commitment that might involve leaving significant portions of the nation\u2019s oil and gas reserves untapped.The business trends that have made coal an undesirable investment will ultimately humble oil and gas companies as well, Mr. Massie said. He cited research that suggests averting some of the worst outcomes of climate change will require leaving much of today\u2019s fuel reserves unburned. This means companies with large fossil-fuel reserves could be forced to leave them in the ground.Those who resist calls for divestment often say they prefer to pursue a strategy of engagement with fossil fuel companies, which means using their influence as investors to encourage companies to alter their policies.\u201cThe choice of whether to divest or not is good,\u201d said Geeta B. Aiyer, the founder of Boston Common Asset Management, an investment firm with a focus on sustainability, \u201cbut it\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d She said that engaging with companies across the board could help bring about a future with lower levels of carbon emissions.Mr. Massie said he was skeptical that working with the oil industry companies would lead to any major changes in their strategy or policies. \u201cThe results are not likely to be substantial,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have run out of time.\u201dHe added that his participation in the divestment fight might seem odd given that he was rooted for so long in the financial establishment.\u201cAm I crazy? No. I\u2019m an advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got nine grandchildren.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Greece Calms, Investors Find Other Concerns", "Date": "2015-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreed and fear are the primal forces that in the past have driven the stock market to its highs and lows. Now the dominant emotion among investors seems to be lukewarm enthusiasm.The power of this barely positive thinking can be seen as Greece and Europe appear to edge closer to a debt deal. Avoiding a financial disaster on the Continent would remove a pressing worry that has been hanging over the market for months. Instead of cheering, however, investors will most likely return to fretting over a long list of concerns. And if recent trends continue, they will keep grudgingly buying stocks anyhow.The worries that investors have are numerous and endlessly debated: the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s increasing interest rates, tepid earnings in corporate America, a stronger dollar, conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, and that perennial favorite of the pessimists, something bad happening in China.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 3.2 percent so far this year. But in a testament to the low-energy vibe of this market, the index has not risen or fallen by 2 percent or more on any single trading day in 2015.\u201cThe market would have a heart attack if we did 3 percent,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.From a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.Still, this unappreciated bull market has carried stocks 214 percent higher since March 2009 \u2014 and it recently became the third-longest bull market in the postwar period, according to S.&P. It is now 75 months long, just ahead of the ascent that took place between 1974 and 1980. (It still lags the 86-month rally between 1949 and 1956 and the nearly 10-year bull run that ended in 2000.)Yet as stocks keep rising, investors keep shrugging.\u201cOne thing that has been quite striking about stocks is the lack of participation of the retail investor,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.The Wall Street professionals who prognosticate about the broader stock market are also wanly optimistic. Right now, stock strategists, on average, are recommending that investors have 52 percent of their portfolios in stocks, well below the 60 to 65 percent share that brokerage firms typically recommend as a basic allocation, according to Savita Subramanian, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.But stocks actually tend to do well when analysts have a low level of conviction. \u201cIn the past when strategists have been as or more bearish than they are today, the market has moved higher over the next 12 months 98 percent of the time,\u201d Ms. Subramanian wrote in an email.At some point, however, something will most likely trip up the market \u2014 and it may be some of the concerns that analysts have anguished over in recent years. With a Greek exit from the euro possibly receding as a fear, the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies will most likely now loom as the most immediate concern. The Fed is expected to hold off on raising interest rates until it feels confident that such a move won\u2019t undermine the economic recovery \u2014 and, as a result, it may put off any rate increases until next year. In theory, if the economy is then stronger than it is today, corporate earnings will also be more robust, potentially offsetting the anxiety among investors caused by a rise in interest rates.Higher interest rates could also upset the delicate balance that has helped keep stocks elevated. Company earnings, which typically undergird stock prices over the longer term, have not grown at a strong pace. Investors have been happy to tolerate that at a time when low interest rates have meant investors get low payouts in the bond market. If the Fed were to raise rates, bond yields would also go up, making bonds look more attractive. In the adjustment, the valuations on stocks may come down \u2014 and stay down.And after so many years of low inflation, some analysts are now starting to account for the possibility of inflation rising to a level that causes a big sell-off in the bond market. Productivity indicators are currently low for the United States economy, which means that companies may not absorb a rise in wages, but pass it on to consumers in the form of higher prices, stoking inflation. The Fed may then have to apply the brakes more sharply than investors anticipated, roiling the wider market.\u201cI think the inflation story is turning around,\u201d said David Rosenberg, an economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. \u201cIf we get into an interest rate cycle, things are going to change. Very few Fed tightening cycles ended well.\u201dEven then, the shakeout may not be as bad as the one in, say, 2008. The worst busts in the market tend to follow times of untrammeled excess. The so-so economy of the last few years could stop stocks from tipping into a long slough in the market. Or as Mr. Rosenberg put it: \u201cWithout the boom, you don\u2019t get the bear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Tuna Fishing Melds to Japan\u2019s Taste, Reshaping a 3,000-Year-Old Technique", "Date": "2015-06-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARBATE, Spain \u2014 The fishing boats, swaying in the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, maneuvered one recent morning around an intricate architecture of nets they had laid as a trap. Then the fishermen lifted just one section from the water, heavy with their prize.Dozens of bluefin tuna rose to the choppy surface, thrashing wildly until, exhausted and asphyxiated, the fish gave up the fight, and the fishermen hoisted them onboard by the tail.This trap-fishing method, known as almadraba in Spanish, is considered the oldest form of industrial fishing in the world, dating 3,000 years to the Phoenicians.Even if the tuna\u2019s final struggle and killing with a knife can appear violent, the almadraba has been praised as a sustainable way of fishing. While the boats and nets have been modernized, the method itself has remained largely the same over millenniums.But change is slowly underway. In response to fishing quotas and the demands of consumers in Japan, the world\u2019s largest tuna market, the companies that run the almadraba are shifting to \u201cranch\u201d fishing to help fatten the tuna, rather than lifting and killing their catch.The shift to ranching is \u201cputting at risk a very traditional fishing method, because trying to fatten fish is really different to the original goal,\u201d said Carlos Montero, fisheries manager for Spain and Portugal at the Marine Stewardship Council, a nongovernment organization.Already, one of the four almadraba companies operating along Spain\u2019s southern coast has all but stopped the levant\u00e1, or hoisting of the trap, the most dramatic and spectacular part of the almadraba.The company still uses a labyrinth of nets to trap the fish, but it channels the tuna to an adjacent open-water pool, where they are ranched for four months before being killed, frozen and shipped to Japan.Other almadraba companies are following suit. \u201cFarmed tuna has more fat than wild tuna \u2014 and the Japanese like that,\u201d said Tetsuya Inagaki, a manager at Maruha Nichiro, one of Japan\u2019s largest fish distributors.So valued is the bluefin that by the 1990s stocks were depleted by overfishing, including by tuna boats that drag purse seines, or large walls of netting that can sweep up an entire school.In 2006, tuna-fishing nations responded by agreeing to strict fishing quotas under a 15-year recovery plan. That has helped stocks recover somewhat, but the extraordinarily high value of the bluefin means illegal and unreported fishing continues.But the almadraba fishermen say their method has been unfairly punished for the past fishing excesses of others, not least because in their method, only adult tuna \u2014 weighing on average around 440 pounds each \u2014 are trapped and lifted in their large mesh nets.Rafael M\u00e1rquez, the second officer of the Cabo Plata almadraba, said he was the fourth generation in his family to be part of an almadraba crew. \u201cWe\u2019ve coexisted for 3,000 years with this species \u2014 and certainly as long as we can remember in my family,\u201d Mr. M\u00e1rquez said.The almadraba fishermen work on a seasonal contract \u2014 and then find other work for the rest of the year or, more likely, claim unemployment compensation. The southern Spanish region of Andalusia has a jobless rate of 34 percent.\u201cThe only real change is that it used to be pretty easy to find another job around the port during the off-season, but it\u2019s now almost impossible,\u201d said Fernando Mendoza, who retired last year after 40 years of almadraba fishing.The almadraba season starts in February and runs six months, mostly spent on assembling and then dismantling its complex structure of nets and anchors.The nets form chambers through which the tuna swim until they are trapped in the chamber that is hoisted up.The fishermen even drop white canvas sheets into the water to mimic the underbelly of an orca, the tuna\u2019s predator, and help drive the fish to the last chamber.\u201cSetting up an almadraba is like an architectural project, using all sorts of material, from steel to rubber,\u201d Mr. M\u00e1rquez said.The fishing itself only takes place around May, when the tuna swim through the Strait of Gibraltar into the warmer waters of the Mediterranean to spawn after building up blubber during their winter in the colder Atlantic.The fat is in part what makes bluefin tuna such a delicacy, to the point that the Japanese have recently been paying more for ranched rather than wild tuna, according to Diego Crespo Sevilla, the chief executive of the family-owned Cabo Plata.Mr. Crespo said his company was also considering switching at least part of its activity to tuna ranching next year.\u201cI really believe wild tuna has more flavor, but I understand tastes differ,\u201d Mr. Crespo said. \u201cWhat might work best for the Spanish market isn\u2019t going to be necessarily the same in Sapporo or Tokyo.\u201dPedro Mu\u00f1oz, a partner at Petaca Chico, the almadraba company that now ranches four-fifths of its tuna, said fishing quotas had pushed companies to switch to ranching to remain profitable. For 2015, Spain\u2019s almadrabas were allowed to catch some 756 metric tons, or about 1.6 million pounds, of tuna, about half of what they hoisted a decade ago.\u201cIf there weren\u2019t such quotas, we would just be relying on our old fishing ways,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cMy dream is to reverse the trend and go back only to wild tuna, but dreaming is for free, while running a business requires money.\u201dIn fact, some executives argue that quotas have become unnecessary as tuna have returned en masse to the Mediterranean.Last November, the international commission that monitors tuna fishing agreed to raise the catch by 20 percent \u2014 with strong backing from European fishermen.The European Commissioner for fisheries, Karmenu Vella, said last month that \u201cbluefin tuna, an emblematic stock nearing collapse, is back to life.\u201dStill, Mr. Montero of the Marine Stewardship Council, which runs a sustainable fishing certification program, argued that it would be \u201cvery wrong\u201d to declare victory in efforts to protect the bluefin tuna.\u201cWe\u2019re on the right path but not there yet,\u201d he said. He also noted that, before tough controls came into force, almadraba companies had underreported their catch, like others in the fishing industry.For now, however, tuna ranching is on the rise, according to fishing experts, however attached almadraba fishermen are to their ancient hoisting and killing methods.\u201cTraditions are very important, but pricing drives the market,\u201d said Alfonso Vidal, a Spanish fishing inspector. \u201cA migratory fish doesn\u2019t build up fat in the same way if stuck in a pool, but I\u2019d also be lying if I said that I could easily taste the difference between wild and ranched tuna.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on June 7 about a shift in commercial tuna fishing methods off Spain\u2019s southern coast to respond to the demands of consumers in Japan, the world\u2019s largest tuna market, misstated the 2015 tuna quota for Spanish companies that run an ancient trap-fishing method known as almadraba. It is 756 metric tons, or about 1.6 million pounds, not 2,200 pounds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tsipras Attacks Greece\u2019s Creditors as Pressure Grows on Debts", "Date": "2015-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, on Tuesday blasted his country\u2019s creditors for austerity measures that he said were humiliating and strangling his people as pressure mounted on Athens to present reforms in exchange for bailout funding.With critical deadlines pressing \u2014 the Greek bailout program expires in two weeks, when a huge payment on debt is due \u2014 European Union policy makers were discussing the possibility of an emergency summit meeting to determine a solution if eurozone finance ministers fail to broker a deal at their meeting on Thursday.The standoff with Greece could have severe repercussions for European integration if Greece becomes the first country forced out of the 19-member currency bloc.European stock markets and the euro were little changed on the day, and only in Athens did things appear particularly bleak, as stocks fell nearly 5 percent and bond yields stood at levels suggesting investors believe default on Greece\u2019s bailout loans was a distinct possibility.Michael Heise, chief economist for Allianz, the German insurance giant, said in an interview that he believed the eurozone\u2019s other member states would \u201ctake sensible action\u201d to ensure stability, and that the European Central Bank \u201cstands ready to intervene if necessary\u201d to calm markets.Still, he noted, \u201cno one really knows how this sort of thing would play out.\u201dThe latest round of months of talks between Athens and its creditors broke down during the weekend over the steps that Greece must take to reform its pension and tax systems in exchange for desperately needed financing.Since winning a four-month extension of the country\u2019s bailout program in February, Mr. Tsipras has sought to elevate the talks to the highest political level in order to minimize opposition from the creditors \u2014 the eurozone member states, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Along with the European Commission, the central bank and the fund are also keeping track of whether Greece is carrying out reforms and meeting budget commitments.Preben Aamann, a spokesman for the European Council, the body that organizes leaders\u2019 summit meetings, said on Tuesday that no decision would be made on whether to hold a meeting of euro-area leaders until later this week.The \u201cnext and hopefully decisive step is the Eurogroup,\u201d Mr. Aamann said, referring to the group of finance ministers who are meeting Thursday in Luxembourg.In an address to lawmakers of his leftist Syriza party, Mr. Tsipras said he would keep working with creditors for a deal. But he combined that appeal with a renewed stridency.\u201cWe will keep working for a solution\u201d but any agreement should \u201credistribute the burden\u201d and not hurt salaried workers and pensioners who have already suffered in the five-year crisis, he said in a speech broadcast live on Greek television.\u201cThe creditors want to humiliate the Greek people\u201d and \u201cto send the message that a popular mandate cannot change anything,\u201d he said.Mr. Tsipras, whose left-wing government was elected in January on a platform of putting the interests of Greece\u2019s electorate before those of its creditors, challenged European leaders to move more rapidly toward recommendations by the International Monetary Fund to ease Greece\u2019s huge debt burden.\u201cHow can they accept I.M.F. \u00e0 la carte?\u201d Mr. Tsipras asked. \u201cThey accept its measures but not its call for debt restructuring.\u201dBut Mr. Tsipras also accused the fund of \u201ccriminal\u201d responsibility for errors in Greece\u2019s economic reform program that deepened the recession. As for the European Central Bank, another major creditor, it was \u201ccontinuing with a policy of financial asphyxiation\u201d of Greece, Mr. Tsipras said.The European Central Bank was expected to decide Wednesday whether to extend further emergency funding to Greece\u2019s beleaguered banks.Mr. Tsipras also hinted at a broader impact, beyond \u201csmall Greece\u201d in the event of a default or his country\u2019s departure from the single currency. \u201cThe time has come for Europe to seriously discuss not the fate of Greece but the future of the eurozone,\u201d he said.But euro-area leaders are likely to resist that appeal for direct intervention as long as possible, to avoid capitulating to Mr. Tsipras\u2019s strategy.And in what amounted to a thinly veiled warning to Mr. Tsipras to avoid counting on a gathering of leaders to deliver Greece a better deal than finance ministers, Mr. Aamann of the European Council said that there \u201cshould be no illusions that an agreement becomes easier\u201d or \u201cmore advantageous over time\u201d with the leaders\u2019 intervention.The acute frustration among European Union leaders with the government in Athens was on display Tuesday evening in Brussels, where Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, told a news conference some of his proposals for Greece had been misrepresented.Mr. Juncker said he proposed a plan to Mr. Tsipras to support investment there until the end of the decade. But Mr. Juncker complained that the government in Athens failed to tell the Greek people \u201cexactly what the commission, being one of the three institutions in charge of all this, are really proposing.\u201dMr. Juncker said he had had no contact with the Greek government since Sunday night, when negotiations in Brussels between senior Greek officials and representatives of creditors ended acrimoniously.Mr. Juncker was addressing a joint news conference with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, who said Greece continued to meet the Atlantic alliance\u2019s guidelines for member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Mr. Stoltenberg declined to comment on a suggestion by Mr. Juncker for Greece to make a \u201cmodest cut\u201d in military spending.\u201cGreece has been for many, many years a highly valued and staunch ally,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. Finding a solution for Greece would be \u201cimportant for the European Union, for Greece, and all of us,\u201d he said.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meeting of Eurozone Finance Ministers on Greece Ends Abruptly", "Date": "2015-06-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 A meeting of eurozone finance ministers, hoping to end the impasse in Greece\u2019s bailout negotiations, unexpectedly broke up Wednesday after only about an hour.The quick ending to what had been billed as a make-or-break meeting highlights the acute challenges to keeping Greece from going bankrupt and potentially becoming the first country to be forced out of the eurozone.\u201cUnfortunately we have not reached an agreement yet,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said after that meeting broke up. \u201cBut we are determined to continue work.\u201dThe night still could be a long one for Mr. Dijsselbloem. Officials said he could restart meetings before midnight or early tomorrow morning with Mr. Tsipras, Ms. Lagarde, Mr. Draghi and Mr. Juncker.From a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.A key sticking point was that, according to creditors, the latest Greek proposals did not go far enough. Mr. Tsipras has proposed measures that rein in pensions and raise taxes as a way to meet creditors\u2019 budget targets.The Greek proposals could potentially deliver savings of about \u20ac8 billion, in part by shifting tax burdens to higher earners and companies. But Greece has a spotty record of collecting taxes, and carrying out the plan could pinch economic growth, raising additional concerns for creditors.Further complicating matters, Mr. Tsipras has insisted that the creditors grant some debt relief to Greece. A win here could help Mr. Tsipras head off a potential rebellion in the Greek Parliament. But Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Greece\u2019s biggest eurozone lender, indicated on Monday night that Athens must make concessions first.In reply to Greece\u2019s proposals, creditors sought further tightening of pensions and higher value-added taxes. Mr. Tsipras and his top advisers said those revisions were unacceptable.By midday Wednesday, Mr. Dijsselbloem said there was still much work to do, as the later breakup of the finance ministers\u2019 meeting made obvious.Financial markets, which had been buoyant in recent days in hopes of a deal in the long-running crisis, lost momentum on Wednesday. U.S. indexes slid back, European stocks were mixed, and Greek shares fell sharply. Interest rates on Greek government bonds, a measure of the government\u2019s borrowing costs, rose slightly.The creditors\u2019 new demands included further tightening of Greece\u2019s pension payouts. They also called for an increase in annual revenue equal to 1 percent of gross domestic product from changes to the value-added tax system \u2014 compared with the figure of 0.74 percent of G.D.P. that Greece had offered.The creditors also demanded that Greece increase the value-added taxes in various ways, including raising the sales tax in restaurants to 23 percent, from the current 13 percent. That would be a strong blow to the tourism sector.The I.M.F. is seen as the main proponent of tougher measures. The Washington-based fund\u2019s involvement in eurozone bailouts is a source of frustration for the Greek government, which would prefer to deal directly with European institutions that promote a more flexible approach.But in any case, Greece owes the I.M.F. money from the current bailout program \u2014 including a \u20ac1.6 billion, or $1.8 billion, payment due on June 30, the same day the European part of its bailout program expires. And eurozone lenders like Finland and Germany have insisted on a continued role for the I.M.F. as a way to ensure adherence to the bailout terms and a hard line in negotiations.For the government in Athens, the urgent goal is to unlock frozen payments from the eurozone and the I.M.F. that are worth \u20ac7.2 billion before the end of the month.For powerful creditors like Germany and the I.M.F., a deal must force Greece to make far-reaching changes to its sclerotic economy so the country can return to growth and pay back its debt.The leaders of smaller eurozone countries like Ireland, Lithuania and Portugal are particularly wary of a deal, because their citizens have already weathered years of austerity and could punish their governments for making too many concessions.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After an Era of Ups and Downs, Home Prices Return to Sanity", "Date": "2015-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsWESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. \u2014 Donte and Anjoli Hill postponed their honeymoon indefinitely and squirreled away cash wedding gifts in order to afford the down payment on the four-bedroom house they bought a few months ago in this Tampa suburb.In the process, they weren\u2019t just securing a home where they could start a family one day. They were helping the United States housing market return to normal pricing after 15 years of yo-yoing insanity.A decade ago the market was unquestionably too hot. Four years ago it was too cold. Now, by a wide range of measures, nationwide home prices look relatively normal when compared with incomes, rents and other fundamentals \u2014 and are rising at similar low, single-digit rates.In contrast to the periods of irrational optimism and pessimism, the market is settling into a balance in which buyers are comfortable spending what they can afford given their income and savings, but aren\u2019t willing (or able to persuade lenders) to stretch beyond that. Among buyers there is neither a sense of desperation to buy now on the assumption prices will rise rapidly, nor of fear they will plummet.For a while in 2013 and early 2014, national home prices were rising at a double-digit percentage rate, which if sustained could have rapidly led housing back to its bubble-era extremes. But the reality \u2014 of caution on the part of home buyers and their lenders \u2014 soon set in. In the 12 months ended in March, the S.&P. Case-Shiller national home price index rose only 4.1 percent, not much higher than the rise in Americans\u2019 incomes and broadly consistent with longer-term trends.\u201cThe market is coming back, but we\u2019re not having astronomical growth,\u201d said Thomas O\u2019Bryant Jr., the chief executive of the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors. \u201cWe\u2019re having the kind of growth that is going to be sustainable, and any time you have steady growth it\u2019s much better than having bubble growth.\u201dThe choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.But to see how home prices are now lining up better with fundamentals, consider the transaction history of the yellow 2,700-square-foot house on Spoonflower Circle where the Hills have been busy installing new door fixtures and a ceiling fan with help from how-to videos on YouTube.A person earning the 2006 average weekly wage in Pasco County, where the house is, would have had to pay 73 percent of her income to buy the house, assuming prevailing mortgage rates and a 10 percent down payment. At its foreclosure last year, that fell to 22 percent, given the lower sale price and mortgage rates, along with inflation and income growth. The mortgage on the price the Hills paid in March equaled 29 percent of an average county resident\u2019s income, about the level financial planners recommend.After a long round trip, the price of the house in this particular middle-class suburban subdivision pretty much makes sense given the incomes of middle-class people in the surrounding county.Donte Hill, 31, sells insurance for a living; Anjoli, 33, works in marketing. Their decision to buy after years of renting embodies the new era of balance in the housing and rental markets. \u201cYou want stability, and so you want to make sure you can afford it and sustain the debt you\u2019re taking on, so that you have something no one can take away from you,\u201d Ms. Hill said.She made spreadsheets to figure out what they could afford; he researched risks of things like sinkholes and flooding. By their math, renting a house with the equivalent of their mortgage payment would have covered a somewhat smaller house, and the total costs of renting versus buying \u2014 incorporating things like homeowners\u2019 association fees \u2014 are roughly equivalent.Their lender, they said, carefully vetted their income and where the down payment had come from. \u201cThey verified three years of employment and checked all our stocks, mutual funds, bank accounts,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cThey wanted to know where it came from, why we transferred it. That helps you feel comfortable that they\u2019re looking at it in depth.\u201dIn 2005, home prices in Wesley Chapel rose 29 percent, according to data from Zillow. The same year, rents in the Tampa area rose less than 3 percent, according to Labor Department data, meaning that homes became far less affordable relative to a similar-size rental that year. Over long periods of time, those numbers would be expected to move roughly in tandem.The collapse that began in 2007 created a different set of problems, as the lengthy process of foreclosures and short sales dragged out, and the only buyers in the market seemed to be investors looking to buy cheap houses to rent out. Wesley Chapel home prices fell 49 percent from mid-2006 to early 2012, a span in which Tampa-area rents rose 10 percent.Now, investors are retreating as prices recover, and people buying houses to live in are returning \u2014 though not with the fervor and pay-anything sensibility of a decade ago. \u201cI\u2019m seeing younger buyers being more cautious and approaching this as a longer-term investment,\u201d said Ms. Eddins, who works at Seven Oaks Realty. \u201cI don\u2019t see a mind-set of \u2018We\u2019ll be here a couple of years and we\u2019ll flip it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dStill, the fact that the relatively balanced housing prices of today are dependent on mortgage rates being near record lows does create some risks, argues Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. An abrupt rise could sharply reduce housing affordability and push down prices.It all depends on why rates rise, and how quickly. \u201cIf rates are rising because of stronger economic growth, the housing market should be able to absorb the hit and it will be perfectly manageable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if mortgage rates rise for external factors or for reasons not warranted by growth in the economy, it would be damaging.\u201dIn other words, a reversal in the era of low interest rates and cheap money wouldn\u2019t have consequences just on Wall Street. It could matter a lot on Spoonflower Circle as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Brazil, Investors Pay a Premium for Tradition", "Date": "2015-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney-market funds with no minimum investment charge an average annual fee of 3.14 percent, according to the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association. Stock market mutual funds sold to retail investors charge an average of 2.13 percent.That is more than triple the 0.7 percent average fee that stock market mutual funds charge in the United States, according to the Investment Company Institute.Financial professionals in Brazil say that customers are accustomed to working through their banks and that the three biggest banks have a stranglehold on the largest part of the asset-management business. The banks contend that regulation adds to the cost of doing business.A glance at the funds on offer at the big banks shows expenses that would shock many American investors.Some short-term bond funds, which are 100 percent invested in government debt, charge investors a 4.5 percent annual fee. Many index funds \u2014 which do no research or stock picking but merely emulate part or all of the stock market \u2014 charge 3.5 percent. Funds that do try to pick the best stocks often charge either a 4 percent annual fee or a hedge fund \u201c2 and 20\u201d model, in which investors pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of returns.Big investors can find cheaper options, but even including institutional investors, the average stock market mutual fund fee is still 1.8 percent and money-market funds charge 0.69 percent. Money-market funds in the United States charge on average 0.13 percent, or less than one-fifth the Brazilian rate.Brazilian fees are especially surprising because money managers should have an easier job than their United States or European counterparts.And the entire stock market has only 448 companies, of which only about 80 have enough shares in circulation to interest mutual funds.Stock pickers in the United States must choose from more than 5,000 companies, and with basic interest rates close to zero, many money-market and bond funds must scramble just to break even.It is an axiom among economists that if a business is lucrative, new companies will enter, and the increased competition will bring down prices for consumers and profits for business.That has not been the case in Brazil\u2019s investment industry.\u201cThe banks\u2019 fund divisions have small staffs and fantastic revenues,\u201d said William Eid Jr., a finance professor at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas School of Business Administration in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s the best business in the world.\u201dExcluding Luxembourg and Ireland, which mostly sell to offshore investors, Brazil has the world\u2019s fifth-largest mutual fund industry, bigger than Japan\u2019s and more than double Germany\u2019s.Yet foreign entrants are scarce. Global banks with long-established retail operations in the country, like Santander and HSBC, are significant players but still lag far behind the big three. No pure-play asset manager cracks the top 10 list of assets under management.The biggest is Western Asset, and its Brazilian mutual funds have only about $10 billion in assets, 1.1 percent of the industry total.The chief executive of another independent asset manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his firm, like Western Asset, also depends on the big banks for distribution, highlighted that they keep costs high.\u201cThey take for distribution at least 70 percent of the revenue. If we charge 3 percent on a fund, at least 2.1 percent is going to the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t let us lower costs.\u201dReinaldo Le Grazie, chief executive of Bradesco Asset Management, declined to say what his firm charged, but he said that standard distribution costs in the industry were lower: 50 percent of the management fee for new funds and 30 to 40 percent for established ones.It is impossible to verify the number independently because these costs are not public in Brazil, though that is supposed to change next year.In the United States, \u201cfund supermarkets\u201d like Fidelity or Charles Schwab charge either a set fee \u2014 usually $50 \u2014 or an annual fee of less than 0.25 percent of assets for selling other firms\u2019 funds on their websites.\u201cDistribution here is expensive because almost no sales are over the Internet,\u201d Mr. Le Grazie said. \u201cThey\u2019re done person-to-person through advisers in our branch offices.\u201dMany American banks and full-service brokers sell funds in a similar manner. They often charge a 5 percent sales commission or 1 percent of fund assets each year for distribution, but the market share for these \u201cload\u201d funds is only 20 percent in the United States and is falling rapidly.Carlos Massaru Takahashi, the chief executive of BB DTVM, a division of Banco do Brasil and the country\u2019s largest asset manager, attributed the higher costs to regulations.Even for money-market funds, the manager must send, by mail, an account summary every month and summon investors for an assembly at least once a year, he said. The manager must also compute holdings on a daily basis and present them to any investor on demand.\u201cThese rules make the industry transparent and safe, but they increase costs,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said.Several independent Brazilian brokers have started fund supermarkets, where investors can choose from many mutual fund families and often pay lower fees. But even the biggest, XP Investimentos, is tiny. Its distribution platform has doubled in size since last January, but it still has less than 1 percent of the mutual fund market.\u201cThe problem is cultural,\u201d Guilherme Benchimol, the chief executive of XP Investimentos, said. \u201cWe have to prove to clients that it is as safe to invest with a brokerage as with a big bank.\u201dProfessor Eid echoed his opinion.\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture you see throughout the Brazilian economy that keeps costs high: too much bureaucracy, not enough competition, and consumers who accept high prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Debt Crisis Splits Congress on Party Lines and Draws Muted Response From White House", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the federal response was relatively reserved on Monday. The White House made it clear that Puerto Rico would not receive a \u201cfederal bailout\u201d but expressed some support for an effort to allow the island\u2019s public corporations to use federal bankruptcy protections. As a United States commonwealth, Puerto Rico is not allowed to authorize bankruptcy, which means that impairing its debts could prove practically impossible.But the push in Congress for Chapter 9 faces stiff opposition from many Republicans, particularly conservatives, who say that allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its debts in bankruptcy would amount to a free pass for decades of fiscal mismanagement by local government officials.The debate could have significant ramifications for the 2016 presidential elections, particularly in the critical battleground state of Florida, which has a growing population of people who have left Puerto Rico. Many of these residents departed because of the declining economy but still have families there and stay engaged in local politics.\u201cMy island needs help,\u201d said Janice Lebron-Gerena, a middle school teacher, who moved to Florida from Puerto Rico a few years ago.The most immediate effect of Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s debt warning was felt on Monday by holders of Puerto Rico debt and the companies that insure it. The price of some Puerto Rico general obligation bonds declined as much as 12 percent, to about 68 cents on the dollar, one of their largest declines in recent months, traders and analysts said. Bond insurers\u2019 stocks were down as much as 23 percent.\u00a0While investors have been expecting some kind of restructuring of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt in the coming months, the governor\u2019s statement indicated that even general obligation bonds, whose repayment is guaranteed by the island\u2019s constitution, could be altered.In an interview last week, members of Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s senior staff said they would soon begin reviewing all of the island\u2019s different forms of debt and begin reaching out to creditors about possible restructurings.\u201cWhat we are doing right now is looking at every single issuer and deciding what issuers will be approached,\u201d said Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, which oversees all of the island\u2019s debt deals. One proposal under consideration by Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s team would involve creditors exchanging their current bonds for ones with more favorable terms for Puerto Rico. There has never been a restructuring of municipal bond debt on such a vast scale. Detroit, which declared the largest municipal bankruptcy in history in 2013, owed only a fraction of the debt that Puerto Rico has borrowed.Still, the broader effect of Puerto Rico\u2019s warning on the municipal bond market was initially muted. Prices of most municipal bonds increased, partly mirroring a rally in United States Treasury prices that was driven by the instability in Greece. Municipal bond prices often track Treasuries.Investors said the broad gains in the municipal bond market showed that Puerto Rico\u2019s problems, while dire, would not lead to more systemic disruptions in the $3.7 trillion market that lends money to cities and states.\u201cIt is an overwhelmingly high-quality market,\u201d said Hugh McGuirk, a vice president and portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, who oversees $22 billion in municipal bond assets. \u201cThere are still so many governments doing the right things like cutting expenses and balancing budgets.\u201dThe relative stability in the municipal market may explain some of the reluctance among federal officials to intervene more aggressively in Puerto Rico.It has not been for a lack of trying on the part of the Garc\u00eda Padilla administration. Puerto Rico officials and their lawyers proposed that the Treasury guarantee some of the island\u2019s bonds to lower its borrowing costs, people briefed on the matter said. The Treasury rejected the idea, the people said.Instead, Treasury officials have been advising Puerto Rico officials on fiscal policy and practices \u2014 which the White House said was a similar response to the federal approach to the crisis in Detroit.\u201cDetroit did not receive anything you could say was like a federal bailout,\u201d the White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday. \u201cIt did receive significant advice. And that did have a measurable impact on their ability to turn their problems around.\u201dA key difference is that Puerto Rico \u2014 unlike Detroit \u2014 doesn\u2019t have access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, which provides a legal framework for municipal governments to restructure.Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of the House of Representatives, Pedro Pierluisi, has sponsored a bill, the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act of 2015, which would allow certain parts of the Puerto Rico government to seek bankruptcy protection.The bill would let certain large public corporations on the island declare bankruptcy, allowing them to reduce debt with a current face value of about $25 billion, out of Puerto Rico\u2019s total $72 billion of bonds. The commonwealth itself would remain excluded from bankruptcy.One major public corporation on the island is Puerto Rico\u2019s electric power authority, which has about $9 billion of bonds and owes a cash payment of $416 million to its bondholders on Wednesday. Other large public enterprises provide highways, drinking water, ports and telephone service on the island.In February, the regulatory reform subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bankruptcy bill, which Democrats uniformly supported while Republicans remained lukewarm at best.\u201cBondholders purchased Puerto Rican bonds at a time when Chapter 9 was not an option,\u201d said Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is the full Judiciary Committee chairman. \u201cProposals to retroactively impact investors\u2019 rights should be reviewed with care and caution.\u201dDemocrats said it appeared that Puerto Rico had been denied access to bankruptcy inadvertently, when the most recent amendments to the code were drafted. If Puerto Rico was excluded on purpose, they said, the reason was not clear.Mr. Earnest said on Monday that the White House has urged Congress to consider the proposal. And a spokeswoman for the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement, \u201cHouse Republicans should bring this legislation for a vote as soon as the House is back in session.\u201dHowever much they may support extending Chapter 9 to key parts of Puerto Rico\u2019s government, the Democrats cannot advance the legislation without Republican votes.Puerto Rico\u2019s financial problems may be confined to the island, but they are resonating with the roughly five million people of Puerto Rican descent living on the United States mainland. Many of the most recent migrants have settled in Central Florida, and their political influence has been growing in a state that could decide the 2016 presidential election.Ms. Lebron-Gerena left Puerto Rico for Florida not long after she couldn\u2019t find a job that paid enough. Her brother still works on the island as a police officer, and she worries that his pension will be cut like those of the island\u2019s teachers. \u201cIf a candidate would offer help, that would be very important for us in deciding who we would vote for,\u201d she said.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Variable Annuity Plus Guaranteed Income Merits Careful Scrutiny", "Date": "2015-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringASK retirees to design the perfect investment and it would surely be a guaranteed paycheck for life, providing protection in the market\u2019s darkest hours, yet allowing them to profit during upswings.But all of these promises come at a steep cost \u2014 3.5 percent annually, on average, and often higher \u2014 which will gnaw at even the best-performing portfolios over time. So before signing any contracts, investors should first ask themselves if they fully understand what they are being offered. And then, they should weigh whether they could do better with a simpler investment.\u201cWe needed two Ph.D.\u2019s in math and some of their grad students to use their software normally used to analyze collapsing stars to figure it out,\u201d he said, only half-jokingly. \u201cI purchased it because I did the math and it looked like it was a good deal relative to other products.\u201dThe money held in variable annuities with guaranteed income riders has doubled in the last five years to $843 billion in 2014, from $411 billion in 2009, according to the Limra Secure Retirement Institute, an industry research group. Sales were $67 billion last year, down from a peak of $96 billion in 2011, partly because some insurers have reduced their business.So exactly how do they work \u2014 and how and when, if ever, should they be used?Every contract has unique twists, but here is how a hypothetical variable annuity with a guaranteed income rider could operate. An investor makes an initial payment, say $200,000, which is then invested. The investor might choose to take withdrawals right away, or let the tax-deferred portfolio grow.From here, it gets a little tricky. The size of the guaranteed paycheck is based on what you might think of as a \u201cshadow account,\u201d because its starting value mirrors the initial investment. But the shadow account, technically known as the benefit base, does not hold real money. It exists solely to calculate the amount of the investor\u2019s paycheck.The benefit base is usually guaranteed to grow by a set percentage, say 5 or 6 percent each year, until the investor starts collecting income. But if the investor\u2019s actual portfolio is worth more than the base on a specific date each year, the benefit base will increase to that amount. If the market plunges, the real portfolio will suffer \u2014 but the shadow number and future paychecks will remain intact.The guaranteed paycheck is a fixed percentage of the benefit base \u2014 perhaps 5 percent annually at age 65, or 4.5 percent for a couple \u2014 depending on the investor\u2019s age when the income begins. The paychecks and hefty fees are deducted from the actual portfolio. If the portfolio is eventually depleted, the paychecks will continue based on the shadow account\u2019s value, just as they always have.Some variable annuities with income riders, however, are far more flexible because investors can change their minds. If the stock market is strong \u2014 and a retiree decides she no longer needs the income guarantee \u2014 some riders or contracts can be canceled. However, many contracts charge harsh surrender penalties, which can last for the first seven years or longer so it is important for investors to know which kind they are buying.Investors who stick with the product are likely to find their portfolio may shrink more rapidly than a low-cost mix of investments, particularly when withdrawing 5 percent a year, while paying an added 3.54 percent in total fees, on average, according to Morningstar.That is why investors are told to invest aggressively, particularly when the annuity is part of a portfolio. Yes, this is the one instance where putting 100 percent in stocks is often recommended. The reason: No matter how far the market plunges, investors can still collect the guaranteed paycheck, which can never decline. If the portfolio rises with the markets, the paycheck will as well, which is why insurers increasingly cap the amount that investors may put in stocks.But that also means investors need to be comfortable watching their portfolio plummet in market downturns, while maintaining an unwavering faith in their insurer. One 77-year-old retiree from the New York area, who did not want to be named, could not handle the volatility during the market downturn in 2008 and 2009, even though his guaranteed income stream of 6.5 percent, or $39,000 annually, would continue until he was 85.At that point, his contract required that he collect less, or 5.5 percent, a provision that he said had not been explained to him. He was not confident the lower amount, with diminished purchasing power from inflation, would be enough. After holding the annuity for two and a half years, he terminated his contract in 2012, paying a surrender fee of $42,000.Stan Haithcock, an independent agent who specializes in annuities and calls himself Stan the Annuity Man, said that some brokers oversell the possibility that your paycheck can grow if the markets do well. They also overemphasize the guaranteed returns, which accrue to your benefit base (and not your actual portfolio), implying their money is growing at a high yield. More important, he said, is the promised percentage investors can withdraw.\u201cThat is where the games are played,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need to focus on the very end number.\u201dHe has another suggestion for consumers considering these products. After the broker is done with the sales spiel, summarize the product as you understand it. \u201cWrite it just as you hear it,\u201d Mr. Haithcock said. \u201cSign and date it, and have them sign and date it. That is how you protect yourself.\u201d\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, \u201cin most cases, they don\u2019t sign.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Fly High on Fantasy Accounting", "Date": "2015-06-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameTechnology shares have been powering the stock market recently, outperforming the broader stock indexes by wide margins. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, for example, is up 19 percent over the last 12 months, almost twice as much as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which has risen 10 percent.Investor enthusiasm for all things tech is understandable, given the disruptions the industry is bringing to so many businesses and the potential profits associated with that upheaval.But there\u2019s a more troubling aspect of the current exuberance for technology stocks: the degree to which so many of the popular companies with premium-priced shares promote financial results and measures that exclude their actual costs of doing business.These companies, in effect, highlight performance that is based more on fantasy than on reality.Corporations still must report their financial results under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. But they often play down those figures, advising investors to focus instead on the numbers favored by those in the executive suite \u2014 who, it just so happens, stand to gain personally from the finagling.Among the biggest costs these companies ask investors to ignore are those associated with stock-based compensation, acquisitions and restructuring. But these are genuine expenses, so excluding them from financial reporting makes these companies\u2019 performance look better than it actually is.This, in turn, makes it harder for investors to understand how their businesses are really doing and whether their shares are overvalued or fairly priced.Not all technology companies encourage the use of funny figures. Apple and Netflix report only GAAP results. But they are in the minority.Cooking up funny figures to accentuate the positive at a company is not a new problem. Justifying rocketing stock prices with kooky financial metrics was central to the 1999 Internet mania. We all remember how that ended.But while today\u2019s creativity in financial reporting is more down to earth than it was during the last boom, the use of performance measures that exclude some basic corporate costs seems to be growing among companies.We\u2019re talking real money. In 2013, Mr. Ciesielski also found that the difference between these companies\u2019 GAAP profits and earnings without the bad stuff was $46 billion in 2013. This was down from 2012, but it was more than double the amount in 2009.But perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the funny numbers used by companies is the way they serve to raise executive pay levels. That\u2019s because these companies often exclude the cost of stock grants awarded to executives and employees, significantly improving reported performance.Investors may be focusing on the revenue growth at Salesforce.com \u2014 up 32 percent last year and up 34 percent on average in each of the last four years. Or that the company\u2019s most recent loss was half that generated in 2014.But when Salesforce.com computes its executives\u2019 cash incentive pay, its $146 million operating loss turns into a $574 million operating profit. This transformation occurs because the company excluded $565 million worth of stock grants awarded to employees last year.Investors may be growing concerned about these games of pretend. A sign of the discontent is the increasing support for \u201csay on pay\u201d measures, in which shareholders express views on company pay practices.Chi Hea Cho, a spokeswoman for Salesforce.com, said in a statement: \u201cWe describe our pay practices in significant detail in our proxy statement, including our compensation philosophy and the rationale for our executive compensation decisions. We value the opinions of our shareholders and have engaged in an active dialogue with them on executive compensation practices.\u201dMs. Cho declined to comment on the company\u2019s decision to exclude stock grants from its performance pay measures. But she pointed me to company filings, which note that \u201cstock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.\u201dBrian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains, questioned any company\u2019s exclusion of stock grants when assessing executive performance.\u201cOne has to be very disciplined about how you measure performance,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThese companies are paying out real value in option and stock awards every year, and if those awards are such a key component and driver of overall compensation in such companies, why isn\u2019t the cost of that key component part of the mix when it comes to judging annual performance and sizing senior management annual bonuses?\u201dCompanies can\u2019t play pretend about the true cost of stock grants in their regulatory filings, of course. And vigilant shareholders know that these expenses often become glaringly evident through the prism of billion-dollar share buybacks conducted by these companies. Many technology companies have to pursue these repurchase programs to limit the diluting effect of their generous stock grants. And they pay handsomely to do so.\u201cLots of investors have ever-shorter time horizons and they care less about what\u2019s embedded in the number than whether the company beat the consensus estimate,\u201d he said in an interview on Thursday.Part of it, too, is bull-market thinking. And when the music stops?\u201cThis stuff doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil it does.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paying Off the Mortgage Is Becoming Harder for Older Workers", "Date": "2015-06-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringBut now older workers, stung by a punishing decline in house prices or high consumer debt, are increasingly unable to pay off their mortgages and are heading into their retirement years with substantial amounts outstanding.They have also been hit by unexpected expenses, layoffs, accumulated credit card bills or college loans, leaving them unable to pay off their single biggest debt unless they work longer, downsize or rely on other borrowing for the monthly payments.Although conventional wisdom says you should pay off your mortgage before retiring, there are some exceptions. Those who are reasonably well-off financially could justify keeping the low-interest mortgage and using the money that would have paid it off to get better returns from investments elsewhere, or to fund renovations that would make it possible to stay in their home.And the amounts owed have grown significantly, said Christopher J. Mayer, a Columbia Business School professor of real estate, finance and economics. Inflation-adjusted mortgage debt for homeowners age 60 to 65 more than tripled, from less than $30,000 to about $100,000, between 1992 and 2010, he found.\u201cWhen we updated our data through 2013, the higher amounts remained steady,\u201d he said. \u201cThe share of homeowners in this age group who do not have a mortgage has fallen to about 45 percent. That compares to 55 percent a decade ago. These are tough numbers for retirees to overcome.\u201d\u201cThen my wife had a stroke and could no longer drive, so we needed to move where she could walk for shopping, groceries and to get her nails done,\u201d he said.That meant buying and renovating a home that was closer to amenities, and required taking out another mortgage.\u201cI focused on paying that off and am now debt-free \u2014 again,\u201d said Mr. Welch, the author or several books on finances.Having no substantial debt in retirement is more than just financial, he added. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it twice, and there\u2019s a feeling of freedom and accomplishment that makes a real difference.\u201dSharon Weekes, 57, a public health employee for Westchester County, N.Y., also sought debt-free retirement years. She and her husband bought a two-family home in New Rochelle, renting out one side of it. He died in 2004, and she shouldered the mortgage on one income.She devised a plan with a financial adviser, made available through her employer, to retire next April. The plan took into account her sources of retirement income, which will include a pension, deferred compensation and, later, Social Security benefits.\u201cI keep my credit cards empty,\u201d she said, and has set aside funds to deal with any unexpected house repairs. She said she might downsize eventually but did not want to rely on a reverse mortgage or personal line of credit. \u201cThen you really don\u2019t own the house,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy add to your financial burden?\u201dTapping into home equity is one of the reasons older people run real risks of foreclosure, warned Lori A. Trawinski, who wrote an AARP Public Policy Institute report on mortgage debt.\u201cThe foreclosure rates have fallen since then,\u201d Ms. Trawinski said, \u201cbut they are still elevated compared to historic rates.\u201dDespite less home equity, \u201cpeople have a strong preference for aging in place\u201d so it\u2019s difficult to determine whether carrying a mortgage in retirement is bad advice for them, she said.Marcyne Acker, 77, of Fountain Valley, Calif., chose a reverse mortgage when her husband, David, died last year and she faced some expensive repairs on the house they bought in 1972. The couple had refinanced their three-bedroom ranch home several times to cover family medical and other needs.With less income coming in, she considered downsizing but found that selling the house, appraised around $600,000, would not net her enough to afford even a smaller property in the pricey California housing market. And if she moved, she was not likely to keep her low property tax rate.After \u201ca lot of trepidation,\u201d she said, she took a reverse mortgage with a 2.8 percent interest rate, plus a 1.25 percent annual insurance rate, that covers her $1,472 monthly mortgage. She withdrew about $25,000 to pay for new windows, attic duct work and house painting.\u201cI got rid of all my credit cards so I only have the property tax and insurance to pay,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to try to pay back the money because my sons would have to otherwise pay it back or buy the house eventually.\u201dFor those who have the wherewithal to pay down their mortgages but choose not to, Bert Whitehead, president of Cambridge Connection Inc., a financial advisory firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., urges them to have a 50 percent mortgage.\u201cWe recommend a 30-year fixed mortgage so our clients can earn more after taxes than the mortgage costs, employ the tax deduction and enjoy protection when interest rates rise,\u201d said Mr. Whitehead, the author of \u201cWhy Smart People Do Stupid Things With Money.\u201d\u201cIf interest rates drop, they can pay it off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this only applies if they place the mortgage proceeds in a balanced investment portfolio.\u201dDonald Potter, a retired hospital executive, and his wife, Linda, both 67, of Ann Arbor, Mich., have mortgages on their main home and their Lake Michigan vacation house. Both have pensions that comfortably cover their $3,000 monthly mortgages. Even so, Mr. Potter initially blanched at the prospect of continuing to carry mortgage debt into his post-career years.\u201cThen we did the math and saw that it makes sense to have a mortgage at 3.5 or 4 percent, and be earning money in the market at 7 to 8 percent, plus you get the tax write-off,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cBut if investments turn south, you\u2019re in a safer position if you\u2019re mortgage-free.\u201dFor those who want to be financially unencumbered in retirement, Jane Bryant Quinn, a columnist for the AARP Bulletin and author of \u201cMaking the Most of Your Money Now,\u201d advises people to first pay off their consumer debt and to increase their retirement plan contributions.\u201cDon\u2019t take money out of a retirement plan to pay such debt,\u201d she said. \u201cHang onto tax-sheltered money. If you are a conservative investor whose alternative is U.S. Treasuries or certificates of deposit, pay off the mortgage. If your alternative is stocks, and you will hold them for 10 or more years, take that option.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shares of Axovant, Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Developer, Surge on Trading Debut", "Date": "2015-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 29-year-old former hedge fund manager has pulled off what is perhaps the largest initial public stock offering ever in the biotechnology industry, creating a company with a market value approaching $3 billion on the basis of an unproved drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease that it acquired for $5 million.Axovant raised $315 million in its offering Wednesday, selling 21 million shares at $15 each. That was 3.1 million more shares than it had expected to sell and at the high end of the expected price range.In Axovant\u2019s first day of trading on Thursday, shares nearly doubled to close at $29.90. .The 29-year-old founder of Axovant is Vivek Ramaswamy, who had previously managed a biotech hedge fund, when, he said, he got the bug to do it himself.\u201cI really was inspired by the possibility of more directly being involved in the development of drugs myself,\u201d he said in an interview on Thursday.Last May, he started a company called Roivant Sciences, which in October created Axovant as a subsidiary to develop drugs for dementia. (Roivant still owns about 80 percent of Axovant after the I.P.O.)In December, Axovant paid $5 million to buy the rights to an Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug that GlaxoSmithKline had given up on after testing it in numerous trials.Glaxo will be entitled to additional payments totaling tens of millions of dollars if the drug makes it to market, plus a 12.5 percent royalty on sales.So what does Axovant see that Glaxo did not?In Glaxo\u2019s clinical trials, the drug, which Glaxo called SB-742457, did not work when used by itself. But in one trial, when it was tested in combination with the widely used drug Aricept, patients getting both drugs had a slower decline in certain measures of cognition and daily functioning than those getting Aricept alone.Axovant said that later this year it will start another trial testing the drug, which it calls RVT-101, with donepezil, the generic version of Aricept. It has said if the trial is successful it could file for approval as early as the end of 2017.To some biotech watchers, this is a sign of easy money and overenthusiastic investors.Mr. Ramaswamy, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, said he did not consider his company\u2019s offering a sign of a bubble.\u201cWe have a potential best-in-class drug candidate\u201d he said, that addresses \u201cone of the biggest unmet medical needs.\u201dStill, Harry Tracy, the publisher of a NeuroPerspective, a newsletter on neurology-related stocks, said that based on Glaxo\u2019s trials, RVT-101 would delay the decline in cognition by only a small amount, rather than fundamentally affecting the course of the disease.\u201cThis is molehill territory,\u201d he wrote.Many companies seek to make a living on the drugs cast off by big pharmaceutical companies, and some succeed. One notable example was Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which paid only $100,000 to acquire a decades-old money-losing drug from the company now known as Sanofi. Questcor built that drug, called Acthar Gel, into a blockbuster by jacking up the price by several hundredfold and aggressively marketing it.Moreover, some existing Alzheimer\u2019s drugs have had sales exceeding $1 billion a year, even though Alzheimer\u2019s specialists say the medicines are only minimally effective. There is a great demand for medicines from the more than five million Americans with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families.Mr. Ramaswamy said that his mother and brother were both doctors and employees of the company, and that all employees were given stock options.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New E.T.F.s Appeal to Those With Bigger Appetites for Risk", "Date": "2015-06-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine a fund that offers exposure to the strategies of the world\u2019s sharpest hedge fund investors. Or one that tracks the steady dividends paid by companies like Apple, instead of their more volatile shares.In stodgy mutual fund land, these are distant thoughts at best.But at the far frontier of the booming exchange-traded fund business, everyday investors can have access to an increasingly eclectic menu of investment themes that, traditionally, were available to only wealthy individuals and sophisticated institutions.E.T.F.s are vehicles that trade like ordinary stocks and follow a standard or specially created index of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. Because of their liquidity, transparency and low fees, E.T.F.s have become the fastest-growing component of the fund industry and now stand at more than $2 trillion in assets.With such growth comes an increased appetite for risk though.The firm\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Eric R. Ervin, recalled that when he was a broker to wealthy individuals at Morgan Stanley, his clients were looking for a way to invest in growing businesses that threw off a consistent stream of dividends while reducing their exposure to the whims of the marketplace.\u201cThe dividends of a business are based on reality,\u201d Mr. Ervin said. \u201cThe stock price is based on emotion.\u201dMr. Ervin also notes that in the last 43 years, there have been only three years when companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have not shown positive dividend growth, while there have been many years when stock prices have ended up lower.So Mr. Evin left his job at Morgan Stanley and established Reality Shares, which, with its flagship DIVY fund, gives an investor, via a suite of derivatives, exposure to broad dividend growth, absent stock appreciation or depreciation.In a rising stock market, DIVY is likely to lag the main indexes. But when stocks sell off, as long as dividend payouts don\u2019t decline as well, Mr. Ervin is betting that the Reality Shares fund will stand out.DIVY has seen some asset growth recently but has yet to truly catch on and has funds of just $31 million.It also relies heavily on derivatives to capture its dividend exposure, which increases its risk profile relative to its peer group. Wide gaps between its net asset value and its share price suggest that this reliance on difficult-to-trade derivatives makes the fund less liquid than other dividend-oriented E.T.F.s.\u201cNo doubt they are innovative, but it is also a complicated structure,\u201d said Paul Britt, an E.T.F. specialist at FactSet Research Systems in San Francisco. \u201cThe wide spreads and the liquidity is also a concern.\u201dTo date, the E.T.F. sector has been dominated by giants like BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, which oversee mammoth funds that track major stock and bond indexes.Now, a slew of smaller names like Reality Shares are coming to the market with the idea of democratizing riskier trading strategies that had not been available to everyday investors in the past.Founded by Adam S. Patti, a former index specialist at Fortune magazine, the fund mimics core hedge fund strategies by buying the relevant E.T.F.s \u2014 ranging from bonds to equities. The fund strives for consistent returns, absent sharp ups and downs. And, to date, it has been more successful in raising funds than Reality Shares, with its main E.T.F. now at about $1 billion.And best of all, says Mr. Patti, one does not have to to put up the rich fees that hedge funds charge their investors.The expense fee for the fund is less than 1 percent.\u201cThere is no need to pay \u20182 and 20\u2019 here,\u201d Mr. Patti said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazilian Companies Are Finding Willing Investors Again", "Date": "2015-06-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Six months ago, stocks and bonds in Brazilian companies were practically left for dead.Things have changed in six months.Although Brazil is still recovering from its economic malaise, the nation\u2019s major companies are attracting investors again. In recent months, President Rousseff has taken steps to cut the budget deficit. And in an unlikely twist, Petrobras itself is emblematic of the turnaround after it sold $2.5 billion in bonds with a 100-year maturity.Brazil, the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy, still faces hurdles. Investors have lost billions in Brazilian companies that are under investigation in possible securities law violations.The real has dropped nearly 40 percent against the dollar in the last year, adding to losses for foreign investors. Inflation is still more than 8 percent. And should the government\u2019s current progress in stabilizing the national debt falter, fears of a ratings downgrade could again send the currency plunging.But, cautiously, some companies are tapping the public markets. Once new management took over in February, Petrobras \u2014 the world\u2019s most indebted energy company, with about $130 billion in debt \u2014 moved quickly to build cash reserves. In the last two months, it raised more than $11 billion from the China Development Bank, the Standard Chartered Bank and three Brazilian banks.The strong demand for Petrobras\u2019s so-called century bond may confirm that investors are willing to lend to and invest in Brazilian companies.In other signs of a turnaround, a local insurance brokerage firm, Par Corretora, held an initial public offering on Tuesday, the first Brazilian company to do so in almost eight months. It raised a modest $190 million, but that exceeded the high end of its target range, as a surge in demand led it to raise its share price.\u201cThe success of recent offerings shows that there is a demand for quality names,\u201d said Jean-Marc Etlin, chief executive of the Brazilian investment bank Ita\u00fa BBA.More transactions are considered likely soon. The reinsurance company IRB-Brasil is expected to file for an initial public offering, seeking to raise $1.3 billion. Another large bank, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, said in April that it was looking to hire investment banks to spin off its insurance division this year in an I.P.O. that could raise $3 billion.\u201cThe government, given its need for money, will probably be aggressive about opening capital in the companies it owns,\u201d said Eliana Chimenti, senior partner for capital markets at the S\u00e3o Paulo law firm Machado Meyer.Stock offerings by privately run companies will probably still take time, because most are waiting to see more improvements in the economy and stock prices. Murilo Ferreira, chief executive of the mining company Vale, said in April that the firm was \u201cworking to have everything ready\u201d to sell a stake in its $30 billion base metals division through a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. But, he said, a decision had not yet been made.But local bankers still say several deals that were filed, then pulled, might return. For instance, Azul Brazilian Airlines, controlled by the JetBlue founder David Neeleman, is expected to again file for an I.P.O., after it withdrew such plans three times.Petrobras, too, is not done fund-raising. It announced in March that it intended to raise $13.7 billion through asset sales.Some $4 billion is expected to come from selling offshore petroleum reserves. Petrobras\u2019s chief financial officer suggested in April that it might spin off its fuel distribution subsidiary, BR Petrobras Distribuidora. \u201cUncertainties have lifted enough that investors can see opportunities,\u201d said Renato Ejnisman, head of Banco Bradesco BBI. \u201cThere are good names available at good prices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asia Markets Slide on Fears About Greece; China Extends Tumble", "Date": "2015-06-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Asian stock markets slumped on Monday as Greece\u2019s financial difficulties triggered worry about possible broader harm to the global financial system. An interest rate cut by Beijing on Saturday failed to stem the fall in Chinese stock markets beyond the first hour of trading.The euro also dropped 1.5 cents against the dollar, to a value of $1.1017, as investors worried that Greece\u2019s troubles would have a spillover effect and make European assets less attractive.Greece has been struggling for a solution to its debt troubles for years. But the speed with which its government called a national referendum and shut its banks appeared to have caught at least some investors off guard. \u201cMost people\u2019s consensus forecast was for them to muddle through with some kind of a deal, so it has taken people a little bit by surprise,\u201d said Kymberly Martin, the senior market strategist at the Bank of New Zealand.The Japanese stock market fell 2.4 percent in midafternoon trade; the Australian market dipped 2.2 percent; and the South Korean market was down 1.3 percent. The price of gold, an asset that tends to become more popular during times of financial or political instability, climbed $12 an ounce, to $1,185.20.The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong had not climbed nearly as fast as mainland markets over the past year and dropped more gently than the mainland did on Monday, falling 2.7 percent in morning trading.The central bank had previously refrained from acting so quickly after a market downturn, so its action over the weekend was interpreted as a clear sign that the government was reluctant to see the Chinese stock markets lose their gains after doubling in the past 12 months.\u201cIt marks a slight departure from the previous P.B.O.C. moves, because this time it looks to be directly timed as support for the equity markets,\u201d said Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy in Hong Kong at Macquarie Capital Securities.But while the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets surged at the opening on Monday, they soon reversed course on sustained selling. Heavy investments with borrowed money by individuals, many of them young and with scant experience in bear markets, have propelled the mainland markets to their current heights, and market strategists have been warning for months that if confidence in the markets cracked, the ensuing fall could be swift.Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for Asia at IHS Global Insight, said that if Greece defaulted and left the euro, the effects on Europe\u2019s economy and on exporters in Asia would depend on whether European leaders could prevent financial troubles from spreading to Spain, Portugal and possibly Italy. If the damage were not contained, economic output in Asia could drop 0.3 percent next year on lower exports to Europe, Mr. Biswas said.But Ms. Martin of the Bank of New Zealand said such calculations were not at the front of investors\u2019 minds. \u201cI think people are still more concerned about the immediate impact, not the longer-term effects on eurozone growth,\u201d she said.An article on Monday about the Asian markets\u2019 reaction to the Greek debt crisis misstated, in some editions, the day China\u2019s stock markets rose after an interest-rate cut. The markets in China rose 2.4 percent in early trading on Monday morning there, not on Saturday morning. (The two markets in mainland China are closed on Saturdays. By midday Monday, shares were down sharply.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Stock Market Plunges", "Date": "2015-06-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Share prices in China plunged on Friday in one of the sharpest sell-offs in years, accelerating a downturn this last week in what has been, for much of this year, the world\u2019s best-performing stock market.China\u2019s two major market indexes fell in tandem. The Shanghai composite fell 7.4 percent on Friday. The Shenzhen composite fell even more, dropping 7.9 percent. Share prices in Hong Kong, which is regulated separately, also fell, by 1.8 percent.Analysts had been warning for months about the risks of a stock market bubble in China, where giddy investors have driven up stock prices by purchasing shares on margin, or with money borrowed from brokers.China\u2019s market has been an anomaly. Even though the broader Chinese economy has been relatively weak, share prices of many Chinese-listed companies have skyrocketed in the last year. Many traded at record valuations, often 80, 90 or 100 times their projected earnings.The high valuations have been a boon for listed companies and their major shareholders. The market boom has also helped encourage a wave of Chinese companies that had listed in the United States to arrange stock buyouts and delist with the intention of eventually relisting in China, where stock valuations are much higher.In the last few months, some well-known Chinese companies have announced plans to buy back shares and delist from the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, including Wuxi Pharma Tech, HomeInn Hotels and Qihoo 360, the Internet services provider, whose management offered $9 billion in a buyout.But China\u2019s roaring stock market showed in the week just past how volatile prices can be: Shenzhen\u2019s main index fell the previous week, then rose early last week, then tumbled again.Authorities are moving to tighten rules on buying stock with borrowed money, which is believed to be one of the key drivers of a stock market rally that has sent share prices to seven-year highs.The regulators are also trying to crack down on financing from unregulated sources, what analysts refer to as over-the-counter stock margin financing.\u201cThis is what triggered the correction,\u201d said Steven Sun, a Hong Kong-based analyst for HSBC. \u201cAlso, there have been controlling shareholders, significant shareholders and corporate management trying to cash out. They had been selling massively into the rally. And these are people in a better position to know the performance of their company.\u201dMany analysts say that the government props up the stock market as a policy move aimed at helping debt-burdened state-owned companies repair their balance sheets. A strong market also improves the financing of private entrepreneurs, which could help spur innovation.But the government has been careful to warn about some of the risks, including the use of borrowed money, knowing that a sharp decline could hurt smaller investors.Analysts at some major banks, including HSBC and Morgan Stanley, have been cautioning investors about the risks of the market, particularly after a big sell-off last month. Although stock prices are still up significantly from a year ago, with the Shanghai composite reaching 5,166.35, up as much as 160 percent in the last two years, there are signs that some of the most sought-after stocks are now in the doldrums.The Shanghai composite is down about 18 percent from its June high. But in Shenzhen, the so-called ChiNext, a kind of Nasdaq-style board on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange for growth stocks, has dropped about 30 percent in the last several weeks, meaning it is already technically in a bear market.The FTSE in London fell nearly 0.8 percent on Friday; while the German DAX closed up 0.2 percent and the CAC in France rose 0.4 percent. United States indexes were mixed: The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and Nasdaq fell 0.6 percent. Chi Lo, a senior economist covering greater China for BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said the Chinese government had promoted the growth of the stock market as a tool for financial reform, like reducing the economy\u2019s reliance on bank lending. But he said the government grew concerned about margin lending, and that, combined with a steady stream of new companies listing their shares on the market, had led to a correction in prices.\u201cThis is not a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for long-term investors to go back in. Many investors weren\u2019t comfortable with those sky-high valuations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loads of Debt: A Global Ailment With Few Cures", "Date": "2015-06-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are some problems that not even $10 trillion can solve.That gargantuan sum of money is what central banks around the world have spent in recent years as they have tried to stimulate their economies and fight financial crises. The tidal wave of cheap money has played a huge role in generating growth in many countries, cutting unemployment and preventing panic.Stifling debt loads, for instance, continue to weigh on governments around the world. Greece\u2019s government has repeatedly called for relief from some of its debt obligations, and Puerto Rico\u2019s governor said on Sunday that its debt was \u201cnot payable.\u201d Both borrowers are extreme cases, but high borrowing, either by corporations or governments, is also bogging down the globally significant economies of Brazil, Turkey, Italy and China. And economists say that central banks and their whirring printing presses can do only so much to alleviate the burden.\u201cMonetary policy can only be a palliative,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Lombard Street Research. \u201cIt cannot be a cure.\u201dOn Monday, the closing of banks in Greece ignited worries of a messy exit from the euro, and stock markets around the world fell sharply. Adding to the turmoil were expectations that the Greek government would not make a debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund that is due on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 350.33 points, or 1.95 percent, while the benchmark index for investors, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 2.09 percent, erasing its gain for the year. It was also the first decline of more than 2 percent since October last year.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Wall Street\u2019s avidly watched fear gauge, known as the Vix, spiked to its highest level in months, suggesting more turbulence ahead.The market turmoil was greater in Europe. The stock markets of Italy and Portugal fell more than 5 percent, while Spain\u2019s was down 4.6 percent. Ominously, each country\u2019s government bonds also sold off, pushing up their yields, which move in the opposite direction of their prices.In China, stocks fell again on Monday, leaving them down more than 20 percent from their recent peak, in bear market territory.Investors sought the comparative safety of United States government bonds. Treasury prices rallied, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.33 percent. Still, when everything is going well, it is easy to forget that there are limits to the power of the central banks, analysts say.\u201cBasically, they haven\u2019t got as much bang for the buck, or bang per euro, or bang per yen, as they were expecting,\u201d said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.Central banks can make debt less expensive by pushing down interest rates. Crucially, though, they cannot slash debt levels to bring much quicker relief to borrowers. In fact, lower interest rates can persuade some borrowers to take on more debt.\u201cRather than just reflecting the current weakness, low rates may in part have contributed to it by fueling costly financial booms and busts,\u201d the Bank for International Settlements, an organization whose members are the world\u2019s central banks, wrote in a recent analysis of the global economy.Many countries are now in a position where their governments and companies live in fear of an increase in interest rates. A further rise in the government bond yields of Spain and Italy could cause a contraction in the fiscal policy of those countries, noted Alberto Gallo, head of macro credit research at the Royal Bank of Scotland.\u201cThis \u2018involuntary tightening\u2019 is what the E.C.B. does not want,\u201d he wrote in an email, referring to the European Central Bank.Even faster-growing economies are also vulnerable. Debt in China has soared since the financial crisis of 2008, in part the result of government stimulus efforts. Yet the Chinese economy is growing much more slowly than it was, say, 10 years ago. This has prompted the Chinese government to pursue policies that expose more of the economy to market forces.\u201cThey have realized that they cannot continue like this \u2014 and that monetary policy doesn\u2019t solve all problems,\u201d Ms. Choyleva said.Countries with high-seeming debt totals are not necessarily fragile. The United States government borrowed heavily after the financial crisis. But as the economy recovered, the debt proved to be manageable \u2014 and some economists contend that it helped stoke the economic comeback. Japan\u2019s gross debt is equivalent to 234 percent of its gross domestic product. Yet it has had no problems finding buyers for its government bonds over the years, defying gloomy predictions of some Western investors.And some analysts contend that Europe\u2019s debt problems are particularly acute because of the euro. Unlike Japan and the United States, countries in the common currency cannot unilaterally loosen monetary policy and let their currencies fall to try and generate the growth that would then make it easier to pay off debts.\u201cGreece needs far easier money than the rest of Europe and it can\u2019t get it because it is locked in with the rest of Europe,\u201d said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Forgiving debts is another way to lighten the dead weight on economies. Writing off debt can hurt banks, but defaults can also clear the system of doubtful loans and accelerate a recovery. Some analysts contend that extinguishing the mortgage debt of households bolstered the United States recovery. But lenders are not always willing to give big breaks to borrowers. Greece\u2019s creditors have so far denied the country\u2019s most recent requests for debt relief.And, in one of the most stressed countries in Europe, a grim standoff over debt is taking place. Ukraine is moving closer to default after creditors continued lending to the country despite zero growth and a corrupt and opaque political and economic system. Now, some of those creditors, including Franklin Templeton, an American investment firm, have resisted Ukraine\u2019s demand they take a loss on their principal investment, preferring instead to extend the repayment period.But last week, Ukraine\u2019s finance minister, Natalie Jaresko, said that a default was \u201ctheoretically possible.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chip Deals in Search of Greater Pricing Power", "Date": "2015-06-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRevenue synergies can be an elusive goal in mergers. Yet three big acquisitions in the chipmaking sector \u2014 the latest Intel\u2019s $17 billion swoop on Altera \u2014 are promising plenty of them. Some acquirers may manage to work magic on their top lines, but it\u2019s optimistic to think all of them will.Intel is paying a premium of more than 50 percent for Altera, based on the programmable chip producer\u2019s share price in March before a possible deal was first reported. Intel already makes some of Altera\u2019s devices, and the sector giant expects 60 percent of the value from the deal will come from integrated products that improve performance, enlarging the market in data centers and the so-called internet of things.There is better logic to Intel\u2019s argument for revenue synergies than the norm. So there should be, considering it is paying a bigger premium than in recent, arguably more defensive, deals \u2014 NXP Semiconductors\u2019 essentially no-premium merger with the $14 billion Freescale Semiconductor and Avago Technologies\u2019 $36 billion-plus purchase of Broadcom last week. Investors, however, have lifted the stocks of all six companies.They were worth about $256 billion combined at essentially undisturbed valuations. Shortly after deals were announced, that figure rises by $33 billion. NXP and Avago proposed annual synergies of $500 million and $750 million, respectively. Intel was cagier, but Altera\u2019s selling, general and administrative costs are about $300 million a year \u2014 so $200 million is surely a generous maximum for simple cost-cutting.Take a 5 percent tax rate for the earlier deals and 25 percent for Intel-Altera, and these savings are together worth a little more than $13 billion today on a 10-times multiple. That leaves nearly $20 billion of increased value unaccounted for. Assume a similarly blended tax rate and the same multiple, and that implies a 3 percent increase in all six companies\u2019 annual sales \u2014 with no added expenses \u2014 or an increase of well over 10 percent in the combined revenue of just the three targets.These back-of-the-envelope results suggest investors are assuming semiconductor consolidation heralds sharply increased pricing power for chip makers. In reality, though, there will be losers as well as winners. The congratulations that so many analysts offer executives on conference calls probably deserve to be kept on ice.Advertisement"}

Yet short-sellers \u2014 investors who stake bets against stocks \u2014 are often the first to sound the alarm on a market\u2019s froth or a company\u2019s fraud.Now, six years into a bull market run, with stocks in the United States smashing one record after another, these naysayers have all but lost their voice.William A. Ackman, who has yet to prevail in a billion-dollar bet against Herbalife, said he would \u201cthink very hard\u201d before making another short bet. James S.

But proponents argue that they play a critical role in tempering market exuberance.As stocks continue to climb higher, some worry that absent a healthy dose of skepticism in the market, investors rushing to participate in the rally are laying the foundation for the next crisis.Being a short-seller is no longer worth the trouble for many hedge fund managers. Investors don\u2019t want to miss out on a rally that lifted the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record high in May. Catering to that demand, hedge funds have abandoned, or pared back, their short positions. Overall exposure to long positions by hedge funds has reached a high not seen since 2007, a year before the financial crisis. Short positions, meanwhile, are much lower than they were at that time, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Betting against the market is not worth the expense, either. To take a short position, traders sell borrowed stock in a company they think is overvalued with the hope of buying it back at a lower price. If the stock price goes up instead, short-sellers have to buy more stock in order to \u201ccover\u201d the position, which in turn pushes prices higher. Over the last several years, traders have hemorrhaged money on such bets, reporting percentage losses that are sometimes in the double digits, according to data compiled by HFR, a research firm.\u201cIt\u2019s been an extremely difficult period for many short-biased managers, as negative performance during this prolonged bull market has led to capital outflows, forcing some to throw in the towel as others struggle to keep the lights on,\u201d said Joseph Larucci, a co-founder of the hedge fund advisory firm Aksia.It wasn\u2019t always this way. In the turmoil of the financial crisis, short-sellers were king. Those who bet on the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns made a mint. As the market spiraled violently downward in 2008, the Wall Street banks that were still standing pointed the blame at short-sellers. In September of that year, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a temporary ban on short-sellers.Nevertheless, by the end of 2008, short-biased hedge funds had made an average return of 28 percent, compared with a decline of 38 percent across the S.&P. 500, according to HFR.\u201cEvery market has its own characteristics, they all have a story and narrative, and this one really is all about the central bank,\u201d said Mr. Chanos, founder of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. The narrative, he added, is that \u201cthe central bank has your back and that\u2019s embedded in everybody\u2019s psyche and portfolio.\u201dThis confidence, in turn, fueled a boom in mergers and acquisitions and spurred companies to buy back record numbers of shares from shareholders \u2014 two of the worst nightmares for any short-seller. To mitigate the risk, many moved to diversify the number of companies they were shorting.Investors, for their part, have sought to place their money with hedge funds that offer long-only funds, according to a Deutsche Bank survey of 435 global hedge fund investors holding half the industry\u2019s $3 trillion in assets under management. Nearly half of those surveyed were already allocated to long-only hedge funds, while 38 percent said that they planned to increase their allocation to such funds.With this tidal shift in demand, short-sellers have looked to raise money by adjusting their pitch to investors. Mr. Chanos\u2019s Kynikos Associates, for example, is pitching a new fund to investors that will take a portfolio of long positions and overlay the firm\u2019s traditional short portfolio, according to marketing documents reviewed by The New York Times. The amount of money that Kynikos manages has more than halved in the last five years, to $2.5 billion today from $6 billion, according to regulatory filings.Even as investors embrace the market rally, there are signs that not everyone believes it is sustainable.\u201cI do think it is an incredibly unloved bull market,\u201d said Eric Peters of Peters Capital Group. \u201cIt is certainly unlike any major bull market that I have seen in that new highs have occurred in the absence of euphoria.\u201dPointing to options trading, Mr. Peters said the cost for investors to insure against a 10 percent decline in the S.&P. 500 relative to the cost of insuring against a 10 percent rally in the S.&P. 500 is three times higher than its historical average.\u201cIt\u2019s telling you that people are willing to pay a lot more for protection on the downside in a really big way,\u201d he said.And some investors are starting to look around for short-sellers to help them find the exits. Jim Carruthers, a former manager at Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s Third Point, raised more than $200 million from investors \u2014 including Yale\u2019s endowment fund \u2014 last year to start a short-biased fund.The other short-sellers who remain, meanwhile, have also been proved right on occasion. Whitney Tilson reaped a windfall this year when Lumber Liquidators, a flooring company he attacked for more than a year, accusing it of selling an unsafe product, came under pressure after a report by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in March. Shares of Lumber Liquidators tumbled 25 percent the day after the broadcast, which accused it of selling a type of Chinese laminate flooring that contained dangerous levels of formaldehyde.Other short-sellers are waiting patiently in the wings, among them Bill Fleckenstein. He planned to start a short fund last year, but later decided it was not possible to do successfully while the central bank continued to pump money into the financial system.\u201cYou can keep the party going, but there is going to be a hangover,\u201d Mr. Fleckenstein said.Mr. Chanos used a similar analogy to describe the market today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Discipline\u2019 for Airlines, Pain for Fliers", "Date": "2015-06-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseAt this week\u2019s meeting in Miami of the International Air Transport Association, the annual meeting of the world\u2019s top airline executives, the buzzword was \u201cdiscipline.\u201dAir Canada\u2019s chief executive, Calin Rovinescu: \u201cPeople were undisciplined in the past, but they will be more disciplined this time.\u201dGot the message? \u201cDiscipline\u201d is classic oligopoly-speak for limiting flights and seats, higher prices and fatter profit margins. This year, that discipline seems to be working: the I.A.T.A. projected this week that airline industry profits would more than double this year to nearly $30 billion, a record.Having recently paid nearly $1,500 to fly round trip on United from Newark to Indianapolis, on a cramped plane on which I had to hunch over to reach my back-row coach seat and complimentary cup of water, this came as no surprise. What\u2019s good for airlines isn\u2019t necessarily good for consumers, as years of mergers and consolidation are now making clear.While it\u2019s not illegal on its face to discuss capacity issues at industry conferences, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch to interpret this week\u2019s comments as thinly veiled invitations to restrict capacity increases to keep ticket prices high. The industry is already highly concentrated, with only four major carriers accounting for 80 percent of all domestic air travel.\u201cWhen airline industry leaders say they\u2019re going to be \u2018disciplined,\u2019 they mean they don\u2019t want anyone to expand capacity,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, professor of economics at Yale and a former deputy attorney general in the antitrust division of the Justice Department. \u201cAnd when there aren\u2019t enough seats, airlines raise prices. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see a smoking gun,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all but saying you need to limit output to keep up prices.\u201dAs anyone who has flown recently on a packed plane should realize, as long as capacity is limited, there\u2019s no incentive for airlines to reduce fares, no matter how low fuel prices or other costs go. The airlines respond that they set prices based on demand, as is the case in almost every other industry.\u201cThat\u2019s fine in an industry where you have competition and consumers have a choice,\u201d Professor Scott Morton said. \u201cBut on most airline routes, consumers have very little choice.\u201d She noted that only since the recent wave of consolidation among airlines have they been able to set prices significantly above marginal cost. \u201cThat\u2019s great for the industry but not for consumers,\u201d she said.That has been reflected in the price of airline stocks: over the last five years, American\u2019s stock has nearly tripled, compared with an 88 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.But this week\u2019s sell-off was prompted by fears that these good times for investors may not endure. Last month Southwest\u2019s chief executive, Gary C. Kelly, said the airline, whose image is closely tied to discount fares, was going to expand capacity this year by as much as 8 percent, with the expansion spilling over into 2016. Southwest had already raised capacity this year to 12.1 billion available seat miles, from 11.2 billion in 2014, as the airline reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week.But after coming under fire at this week\u2019s conference, Southwest quickly moved to reassure investors it isn\u2019t going rogue. \u201cWe have taken steps this week to begin pulling down our second half 2015 to manage our 2015 capacity growth, year-over-year, to approximately 7 percent,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Still, comments about capacity growth from Southwest prompt memories, both unwelcome (among investors) and fond (among passengers) about what is still known as the \u201cSouthwest Effect\u201d\u2014 the phenomenon of sharply lower airfares whenever the maverick upstart Southwest entered a market.But that era seems long over, and today Southwest is an established industry giant, the largest airline based on domestic passengers boarded. \u201cToday it\u2019s not that much different from the legacy carriers,\u201d Professor Scott Morton said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they have as much of a differential effect as they used to.\u201dSouthwest and Delta did not respond to requests for comment.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, said, \u201cWe are taking a disciplined approach to our business, not adding capacity in an attempt to simply expand market share but instead focusing on profitable growth.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d have to say, based on my research to date, that it was a mistake to approve the merger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible there are other efficiencies I haven\u2019t studied. But I\u2019m concerned when I see higher prices and capacity discipline. That\u2019s not what you want to see.\u201dProfessor Sagers said, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an airlines merger in decades in which the promised benefits materialized.\u201dAs for the American-US Airways merger, \u201cPrices have gone up even as costs have gone down. If there\u2019s a consumer benefit, it\u2019s very subjective, and it would have to be very large to outweigh the harm to consumers from higher airfares.\u201dAn American spokesman said consumers had benefited with better schedules and connections (like nonstop service on the Philadelphia-St. Thomas route), better planes and service (in part because cabin attendants and pilots got raises). He said price and capacity competition remained vigorous. American said this week that capacity rose 2.1 percent over May 2014, to 23.3 billion available seat miles, and that it expected revenue per available seat mile in the second quarter to drop in a range from 6 to 8 percent, suggesting increasing price competition in the coming months.Airlines for America, a trade association, said that domestic fares were actually down slightly in 2015.So are airfare bargains about to arrive just in time for the summer travel season?Not if all that talk about \u201cdiscipline\u201d has an effect.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we know the answer to that yet,\u201d Mr. Parker of American said in Miami. But unlike previous price wars, this time \u201cfeels different.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about capacity restrictions adopted by the airline industry, misstated the number of seat miles, a measure of capacity, available on Southwest Airlines in 2015. It is 12.1 billion, not million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Upsides for Steel Industry in a Russian Downturn, Despite Sanctions", "Date": "2015-06-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNikolai G. Vaulin, a steel mill worker, bathes in mineral waters at the Rodnik medical center, owned by the steel company Severstal, under the watchful eye of the head nurse, Irina G. Dudnik.CHEREPOVETS, Russia \u2014 Burly steel workers in this gritty industrial town have their choice of free services at the company spa in a leafy park down the road from the factory.Thirty masseuses are on hand to treat aching backs and sore muscles. The spa menu at Rudnik, or the Spring, also includes hot mineral baths, mud wraps, acupuncture and a sauna \u2014 all served with organic, stress-reducing teas made with local honey.Life is good for workers at the steel company, Severstal.Along with the spa perks, Severstal covers the cost of vacations to Sochi on the Black Sea. A company dental office offers two free fillings annually. Workers also got 8 percent pay raises this year, along with bonuses.\u201cA crisis has supposedly occurred,\u201d Andrei G. Meledin, who works on a production line, said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t feel it here.\u201dAs the rest of Russia retrenches in the face of recession, steel companies like Severstal are booming. In the first quarter, Severstal swung to a $343 million profit, after reporting a loss in the same period a year ago. Falling oil prices, rising geopolitical tensions and Western sanctions have broadly wreaked havoc on the Russian economy. The World Bank estimates that the economy will shrink by 2.7 percent this year.But those same conditions have proven extraordinarily favorable to a certain class of Russian commodity companies, particularly in the steel and chemicals industries. It\u2019s the type of success story that Russia\u2019s government intends to highlight at an economic forum in St. Petersburg later this week. Such companies, which have not been ensnared by sanctions, are benefiting from a weak ruble. These companies have significant costs for raw materials and labor, all of which are denominated in rubles. Their goods, though, are sold on the global markets, where prices are generally set in dollars.While the ruble has recovered somewhat in recent months, it still remains 39 percent off its high of last year. And the central bank is intentionally trying to keep a lid on the ruble\u2019s value, boding well for the companies\u2019 profits.As an unexpected pocket of strength in the Russian economy, steel is helping the country weather the onslaught of Western sanctions and bringing runaway gains for investors who got in this winter.Shares in Mechel, a Russian steel and coal company, are up more than 180 percent since the start of the year, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the world. Share prices for a dozen or so other steel and nonpetroleum commodity exporting companies also shot up this year, leading an overall rise in the Morgan Stanley index of Russian stocks of 19 percent.\u201cWe have it all\u201d in the Russian steel industry, Vladimir V. Zaluzhsky, the head of investor relations at Severstal, said of the benefits of a weak currency and still relatively strong global prices of steel.The success of steel reflects the scattershot effect of sanctions on the economy. Certain industries are shrugging off the restrictions, as others teeter.Strangely, sanctions hit hard in communities with a history of opposing President Vladimir V. Putin politically, such as the urban middle class in Moscow, which is reeling from inflation. The restrictions missed core supporters of Mr. Putin in some industrial and mining towns, while strikes and economic protests have broken out in others.\u201cSmall and medium businesses are hurt by the sanctions\u201d more than large commodity enterprises, said Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThe lower ruble obviously helps exporters and hurts consumers.\u201dSteel has a long history in Russia.The plant here was founded by Joseph Stalin, who liked the metal enough to take the Russian word for steel as his name. Amid the bucolic swamps and fields of the Russian north, the gargantuan smokestacks arose.Central planners poured substantial resources into steel mills, with a special emphasis on giant blast furnaces. The largest of them all, nicknamed Severyanka, or the Northern Woman, opened here in 1986.The Northern Woman is a gigantic cylinder of heat-resisting ceramic tiles, swathed in tubes and scaffolding, continually rumbling and emitting a hissing mist of orange, iron oxide fumes. Valves in this artificial volcano release streams of liquid iron that burble out at a rate of 12 tons a minute.Soviet planners\u2019 fascination with steel soon proved illogical, as plants pumped out vastly more metal than needed. Western economists took to snickering at the bloated size of the Soviet steel industry. By the early 1990s, the factories faltered and the furnaces went cold.But the industry, with its excess capacity, was well positioned for the rise of China in the decades that followed. As China\u2019s economy expanded, its demand for steel soared.By the early 2000s, Russia\u2019s steel towns were back in business. From 1995 until 2007, a period roughly corresponding with the explosive growth in China, the factories ramped up to 90 percent of capacity, from 65 percent, according to a study by Deutsche Bank.Russia now smelts about 75 million tons of low-cost steel a year, of which 30 million tons are exported. On a recent day at Severstal, all the production lines hummed with activity. Managers say the factory operates at about 97 percent of capacity.The industry dynamics, though, have shifted. As China\u2019s growth has slipped modestly, the ripples have been felt in the industry.Over the first quarter this year, global prices for a main type of steel Severstal forges, hot rolled steel, fell to $320 a ton from about $400 a ton, or by about 20 percent. But the costs for Severstal and other Russia companies have fallen further, along with the ruble.To concentrate on Russian operations as conditions improved for the country\u2019s steel players, Severstal sold a plant last summer that it had acquired a decade earlier in Michigan. The company is in the midst of investing tens of millions of dollars refurbishing blast furnaces in Russia.This year, workers\u2019 8 percent raises in April were below the national inflation rate of 16 percent in the first quarter. Still, a dozen or so factory employees said in interviews they had not felt the bite of sanctions as many Russians had.\u201cI drive a Lada,\u201d said Konstantin Makayev, an operator of the blast furnace. \u201cI buy all local groceries. I don\u2019t feel inflation at all.\u201dThe money is flowing through to the community, Cherepovets, a sprawl of apartment blocks nestled in the northern forests.A shiny Kia car dealership opened on the edge of town. With tax revenue from the factory, municipal workers were laying a new ribbon of asphalt on the airport road. The hockey team hired a Canadian defenseman. In a park, boys climbed on the pedestal of a statue of a steelworker.The company spa, too, does a brisk business. It is so strong that Severstal has recently expanded it, opening an offshoot in a picturesque pine forest outside the city. The factory pays all the spa fees for workers.\u201cWe make steel, and we make a lot of it,\u201d said Nikolai G. Vaulin, a steel mill worker, as he soaked in a hot mineral water bath at the spa. \u201cSo we make a lot of money. And some of it ends up here.\u201d\u201cBoy this feels good,\u201d he added. \u201cI feel light. My circulation has improved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "BlackRock Hires Columbia Finance Professor to Guide New Investment Strategy", "Date": "2015-06-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut while BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund company, remains the undisputed market leader for mainstream E.T.F.s, smaller, nimbler firms are challenging it when it comes to introducing a new generation of E.T.F.s that track specific market segments.BlackRock took a significant step on Tuesday to bolster itself in this area by hiring Andrew Ang, a finance professor and advocate of an emerging investment style that singles out themes or factors, like value, momentum and quality of earnings.He will be a managing director and lead a new strategies group that will oversee $125 billion in client assets.The hiring shows the extent to which BlackRock is focusing more attention and resources on systematic approaches to investing as opposed to traditional styles, in which fund managers try to beat indexes.While BlackRock has been pulling in assets at an impressive rate, that has not been the case for actively managed equity funds, which have experienced $17 billion in outflows over the last year because of disappointing performance.Of the $4.7 trillion that BlackRock oversees, $3 trillion is managed in a systematic fashion through E.T.F.s or index funds.Factor-based investing, as it is known within the industry, has been providing the intellectual firepower behind the latest craze in E.T.F. investing \u2014 smart beta funds \u2014 where BlackRock is looking to expand aggressively.Traditional E.T.F.s track an index of stocks or bonds, like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 or a basket of high-yield bonds. Because of their liquidity, transparency and low fees, these funds have become tremendously popular for individual and institutional investors and have contributed significantly to BlackRock\u2019s growth in assets.Smart beta funds, on the other hand, will create a specially designed index that tracks a specific investment theme, like companies that pay the highest dividends or derive most of their earnings from exports, as opposed to the company\u2019s size.Proponents of this approach argue that it incorporates the best aspects of passive investing \u2014 low fees, transparency and a clear set of rules \u2014 and active management.Fund companies like PowerShares \u2014 the E.T.F. unit of Invesco \u2014 and WisdomTree have attracted billions of dollars in recent years by offering these types of funds.And while BlackRock has a full suite of smart beta funds that track a range of market segments, its chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, has not been shy about saying that he has greater expectations.\u201cI do believe there will be more and more E.T.F.s that have some type of tilt or some type of smart beta component to it,\u201d Mr. Fink said at an investment conference last month.But he also said he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that BlackRock was not \u201cinnovating fast enough.\u201dMr. Ang, who has written a book about his investment philosophy, thinks that instead of weighing traditional asset segments, like stocks versus bonds, or the United States versus Europe, investors should focus on factors that drive investment returns, like a company\u2019s relative value and its ability to grow faster than its peers.\u201cFactors are to assets as nutrients are to foods,\u201d Mr. Ang said. \u201cYou create a diversified portfolio with low fees and transparency.\u201dAnd while he says that the active model, in which fund managers try to beat the index, will not go away overnight, the trend, he thinks, is clear.\u201cThere will be a gradual shift,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom active managers to smart beta.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Layover Ends in Penny-Stock Scheme Arrest", "Date": "2015-06-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA man suspected of being the mastermind of a $300 million penny-stock trading scheme is in federal custody because the international flight he was traveling on from Canada to Mexico made a brief stop in Phoenix.The layover on Tuesday at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport gave F.B.I. agents enough time to arrest Gregg R. Mulholland and charge him with overseeing the manipulation of numerous penny stocks and then laundering the profits through accounts at no fewer than five offshore law firms.Mr. Mulholland\u2019s arrest caps a federal investigation that lasted more than two years and first came to light last September with the indictment of four men and an offshore investment firm in Belize, Legacy Global Markets. Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Mulholland was the secret owner of Legacy Global.One of the stocks Mr. Mulholland is charged with manipulating is Cynk Technology, a little-known company based in Belize that claimed to be in the social network business and whose market value soared briefly to $6 billion last summer. The spectacular and bewildering rise of shares of Cynk, a company with no revenue and a single employee, was the buzz of Wall Street last July. Securities regulators halted trading in the stock, suspecting it was being manipulated. The shares of the company plummeted 85 percent when trading resumed on July 25.Federal authorities contend Mr. Mulholland, who is a citizen of both Canada and the United States, concealed his ownership interest in Legacy Global and fled the United States after the firm was indicted last summer. The criminal complaint contends that he used a complex array of offshore entities to mask his activities.\u201cHe concealed his leadership role in this fraudulent network, which included stock promoters, lawyers and broker-dealers by using aliases and sham companies,\u201d Kelly T. Currie, the acting United States attorney for Brooklyn, said in a statement.In a related move, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating the possible manipulation of a number of so-called penny stocks by Mr. Mulholland for several years, charged him with civil securities fraud on Tuesday. The criminal complaint against Mr. Mulholland was signed by Vera Scanlon, a United States magistrate judge in Brooklyn, on June 18. The sealed complaint and arrest warrant gave the federal authorities, which were monitoring his movements, the ability to move quickly and apprehend Mr. Mulholland once he landed in the United States. Federal prosecutors will appear on Wednesday before another magistrate judge in federal court in Phoenix to seek to have Mr. Mulholland extradited to New York.Prosecutors contend the stock scheme orchestrated by Mr. Mulholland began in May 2011 and ended in September 2014, when Legacy Global was indicted. The complaint describes a series of highly successful so-called pump-and-dump schemes, in which Mr. Mulholland and his associates are accused of artificially raising the price of ordinarily worthless stocks by persuading stock promoters to issue misleading news releases and then selling the shares they owned before the stocks crashed.The investigation, according to the complaint, was aided by an unidentified cooperating witness who pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges. The complaint describes the cooperating witness as a lawyer with offices in Utah who was also a former chairman of Legacy Global. The investigation was also aided by court-approved wiretaps, which captured a conversation during which Mr. Mulholland was said to be discussing trading in shares of Cynk.\u00a0Mr. Mulholland became involved with Legacy Global in 2010, moving money away from Gibraltar Global Securities, a brokerage firm based in the Bahamas that ultimately collapsed after it was sued by the S.E.C. in 2013. Eventually, he became the biggest customer of Legacy Global and later bought the firm for $1 million, a move that the authorities said helped him conceal his group\u2019s activities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Agrees to Extend Lifeline to Athens", "Date": "2015-06-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the second time this week that European Central Bank officials had conferred over the troubled Greek lenders. The central bank has effectively kept the banks on life support with billions of euros in emergency funding as anxious depositors accelerated their withdrawals.Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said at a news conference in Luxembourg that the central bank had provided the extra emergency funding on Friday, and he urged the Greek government to push forward with reforms to quell the crisis. It was not immediately clear how much of an increase the central bank had provided.The decision by the European Central Bank was \u201cbasically to cover this urgent financing issue,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said, after the second of two days of meetings of European Union finance ministers. \u201cBut it\u2019s very clear that to regain financial stability, a clear agreement is needed on the program, and a credible strategy needs to be presented by the Greek authorities.\u201dA smaller group of finance ministers, from the 19 countries that share the euro, was unable Thursday evening in Luxembourg to negotiate a deal in the long-running crisis. The stalemate has heightened fears that Greece will default on a large loan repayment on June 30 and that it is on the brink of a destabilizing exit from the currency bloc.Immediately after the talks ended Thursday evening without a breakthrough, an emergency summit meeting of 19 eurozone leaders was scheduled for Monday. In part, the meeting was called to ease fears about the stability of the Greek banking system in the coming days, said one person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Concerns about the Greek banking system have been sharpened by the steep outflow in recent months of deposits in the face of growing fears about the country\u2019s ability to remain in the eurozone.Analysts and bankers said they believed that about an additional 3 billion euros, or about $3.4 billion, was withdrawn from the banks this week.The European Central Bank has been topping up its emergency funding to Greek banks regularly since the beginning of this year. According to figures from the Greek central bank, Greek bank deposits fell in April to \u20ac133 billion, the lowest level in a decade. More than \u20ac30 billion was withdrawn between the end of last November and the end of April.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with the funding of Greek banks,\u201d said a Greek banking official with knowledge of the European Central Bank\u2019s funding decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe all expect a positive outcome on Monday.\u201dBut the funding appears to be draining out of the banks as fast as the central bank can pour it in. When it meets Monday, the central bank\u2019s governing council is expected to discuss more support for Greece\u2019s banks, which suggests that it is considering daily assessments of funding, according to people familiar with the moves.On Friday, the bank decided to increase emergency funding by about \u20ac2 billion, according to people with knowledge of the figures. Outflows from deposits totaled \u20ac1.2 billion to \u20ac1.5 billion on Friday, the people said.The mood in Athens appeared relatively calm on Friday, and bank withdrawals did not appear to have escalated into a full-out bank run. After reports that the European Central Bank would increase the funding, stocks in Athens rose nearly 2 percent in afternoon trading and financial shares climbed about 3 percent.The market may also have been bolstered by a statement earlier in the day from the office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, which welcomed the decision to hold a summit meeting of eurozone leaders, describing it as \u201ca positive development on the road toward a deal.\u201d\u201cThere will be a solution based on respect for European Union laws and democracy that will allow Greece to return to growth within the euro,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Tsipras was in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Friday speaking to business leaders at an economic conference. The visit raised eyebrows in Europe over concern that he was seeking a tighter embrace with Moscow as leverage in his negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors.Those creditors \u2014 the other eurozone countries, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2014 have committed to \u20ac240 billion in bailout loans over the last five years. The European portion of the bailout ends on June 30, and the two sides have been far apart on what steps Greece must take to overhaul its pension, tax and budgeting systems to win continued support from Europe.On Wednesday, the European Central Bank increased its so-called emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks by \u20ac1.1 billion euros, to \u20ac84.1 billion, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, the chief economist at Commerzbank, predicted in a note to clients on Friday that the central bank would probably \u201cshy away from cutting off the vital E.L.A. assistance to Greek banks, which would otherwise prompt Greece to leave the monetary union.\u201dMr. Kr\u00e4mer said that the European Central Bank would probably lower the value it assigns to collateral put forward by Greek banks in exchange for the emergency funding. He said another option for the central bank would be to freeze that emergency funding at current levels in the coming days, although that would \u201cforce Greece to impose capital controls.\u201d\u201cIt thus appears that the Greek drama will keep markets on tenterhooks for a while longer,\u201d he wrote in the note to clients.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, on Friday called on the Greek government \u201cto do a deal before it is too late.\u201dSpeaking before Friday\u2019s meeting of the European Union finance ministers, he said Britain had \u201ctaken the measures to increase our economic security so we can deal with risks like this from abroad.\u201dDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council who convened the emergency summit meeting for Monday, delivered a thinly veiled ultimatum to Greece to be prepared to soften its position or face the consequences of a default.\u201cThe game of chicken needs to end, and so does the blame game,\u201d Mr. Tusk said in a video message on Friday. \u201cThere is no time for any games. It is reality with real possible consequences, first and foremost for the Greek people.\u201dMr. Tusk also appeared to warn Greece not to expect leniency from the leaders on Monday, and said that the summit meeting would not be the final step in the negotiations.\u201cWe need to get rid of any illusions that there will be a magic solution at the leaders\u2019 level,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement Harnesses the Power of Shame", "Date": "2015-06-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRevaluedNorway this month became an unlikely leader in a growing social movement: persuading investors to sell their stock in fossil fuel companies. In Norway\u2019s case, its $890 billion pension fund \u2014 the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world \u2014 will begin divesting itself of its stakes in coal companies. The move, approved by Parliament on June 5, offered a powerful endorsement of a tactic its backers say has the potential to reduce carbon consumption and in that way limit harmful greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tipping point in the last six months,\u201d Ben Caldecott who researches energy and climate change as director of the Stranded Assets Programme at Oxford University, said in an interview. Coal prices are being hammered. The Dow Jones coal index is down 86 percent since 2011. In a recent securities filing, Peabody Energy, one of the country\u2019s biggest coal producers, recently listed the divestment campaign as a risk factor that threatened its share price. The logic of the campaign is that diminishing support from the markets will create financial hardship and ultimately lead fossil fuel producers to change. But there is an open secret: For all its focus on stock holdings, the true impact of divestment campaigns has nothing to do with a company\u2019s investor base, share price or creditworthiness.The most exhaustive study on the subject was conducted by researchers at Oxford, Mr. Caldecott among them. Their report, published in late 2013, examined previous divestment movements \u2014 like those against the government of South Africa in protest of apartheid, and against companies that sell tobacco, alcohol or pornography. It also looked closely at the emerging fossil fuel campaign, analyzing the targeted companies and their shareholders. The study concluded that even if every public pension fund and university endowment joined the movement and sold its fossil fuel stock, the effect would be negligible. \u201cThe maximum possible capital that might be divested by university endowments and public pension funds from the fossil fuel companies represents a relatively small pool of funds,\u201d the study found.That\u2019s largely because most energy company stock is held by big institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity, whose managers are unlikely to use their portfolios to advance moral or social agendas. Moreover, few institutions vote with their dollars. During a three-decade divestment campaign against tobacco companies, only about 80 of organizations and funds ever sold stock to support the cause. \u201cDivestment in itself is neither here nor there,\u201d Atif Ansar, one of the study\u2019s authors and a professor at Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford, said in an interview. \u201cOn its own, it\u2019s not going to generate any real impact.\u201dThat is, for all of the noise divestment campaigns create, they do little to affect the supply-and-demand economics that would undercut the business of mining, drilling for and refining fossil fuels. Even in the case of coal, the stocks of those companies are down not because of divestment, but because shale mining and cheap natural gas have reduced demand for coal.But that does not mean divestment campaigns have no consequences. What they do best is good old-fashioned public shaming. The Oxford researchers found that the negative publicity can create reputational headaches. \u201cIt becomes much harder for stigmatized businesses to recruit good people, to influence policy and, occasionally, to raise capital,\u201d Mr. Caldecott said. Divestment campaigns also give activists a focused \u2014 and easy to understand \u2014 object for their outrage. Critics argue that damaging the reputations of coal and oil companies does nothing to reduce reliance on those fossil fuels.\u201cI\u2019m very supportive of aggressive climate policies,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the Environmental Economics Program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. \u201cBut the message from the divestment movement is fundamentally misguided.\u201dHe contends that the problem is not investment in energy companies; it is an economy that remains dependent on fossil fuel production and consumption. While clean energy production is growing, Western economies would grind to a halt tomorrow without fossil fuels. And the divestment movement has focused on Western companies, while India and China have continued to mine and burn huge amounts of coal. Norway, now a leader in the movement, amassed its gargantuan sovereign fund by drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea.\u201cDivestment comes at the expense of meaningful action,\u201d said Frank Wolak, director of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford. \u201cIt will do nothing to reduce global greenhouse emissions. It will not prevent these companies from raising capital.\u201dA more effective use of activists\u2019 energy, Mr. Wolak and Mr. Stavins said, would be to work on putting a price on carbon emissions through a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. \u201cWhat we need to do is focus on actions that will make a real difference,\u201d Mr. Stavins said, \u201cas opposed to actions that may feel or look good, but have very little real world impact.\u201d For divestment campaigners, moving markets is not really the point, despite their focus on stockholdings. Instead, they are more than happy to provoke companies like Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy. \u201cIf it polarizes the debate, it does so in a helpful way,\u201d Mr. McKibben said. \u201cLeft to their own devices, a sense of concern is inadequate to move the fossil fuel industry to action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-06-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is the current doomsday scenario for Europe.Greece\u2019s bailout talks break down for good, and the country defaults. The European authorities sever life support to Greece\u2019s banking sector, forcing the country to take drastic steps to stem an exodus of capital. Greece decides to drop the euro as its currency.Greece\u2019s unwinding sends shock waves through the global markets. Investors and policy makers have to quickly assess whether the storm is going to pass or gather strength.Although Europe is better positioned to deal with a crisis than it was a few years ago, when Greece last teetered, there is simply no precedent for a country\u2019s leaving the eurozone. And the big test may be only weeks away.Relations between Greece and its lenders have descended into a bitter standoff. The impasse is increasing the chances that Greece and its creditors will fail to forge a deal by the end of the month, when a pile of debt comes due and its current bailout expires.Many in Europe still believe that some sort of agreement will be reached at the last minute, unlocking fresh aid for the debt-burdened country and preventing a painful default.But the war of words \u2014 and the apparent distance between both sides\u2019 positions \u2014 is reducing hopes for a breakthrough. Instead, global financial firms and policy makers are asking what else might break down if Greece were to pull out of the eurozone. On Wednesday, the Greek central bank said \u201ca manageable debt crisis\u201d would \u201csnowball into an uncontrollable crisis, with great risks for the banking system and financial stability\u201d of the country.Many analysts agree that a Greek shock, for a few days, would stoke the sort of confusion and fear that prompts investors to pare back holdings of riskier stocks and bonds and instead pile into assets they see as havens. \u201cU.S. Treasuries will explode in price as people flee to safety there,\u201d said John M. De Clue, a chief investment officer at U.S. Bank. \u201cIt will be the largest risk-off trade that we\u2019ve seen in some time.\u201dBut there is less agreement over how bad things might then get.Optimistic analysts contend that markets would soon steady themselves after the initial shock of Greece\u2019s crashing out of the euro. Much has changed, they say, since 2011 and 2012, when Greece\u2019s problems spilled over into other countries.There are grounds for such confidence.Private investors and banks no longer have large holdings of Greek government debt, meaning their losses would be minimal if the country were to default. Instead, Greece\u2019s debt is now mostly owed to other governments and official entities.Analysts also point out that in comparison with 2011, Europe\u2019s banks are on steadier ground, after the regulatory stress tests of last year and efforts to bolster their capital. In their stronger state, the banks are more likely to keep lending through the sort of stress that might follow an event like a Greek default.Perhaps the biggest difference between the last Greek crisis and now is the stance of the European Central Bank. It has a huge bond-buying program in place that appears to be stimulating growth across the Continent. Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, suggested on Monday that it was ready to step in if declines in bond prices were undermining its stimulus efforts.\u201cWe are closely monitoring conditions to detect signs of an unwarranted tightening of our stance, to which we would need to react,\u201d he said.Still, vulnerabilities lurk in the system.Years of ultralow interest rates have set off a stampede of buying that has helped push stocks and bonds higher in recent years. At these levels, the markets are more susceptible to an unpredictable event like Greece\u2019s exiting the eurozone.The blistering rallies have not taken place just in the government bond markets of countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy. They have also occurred in speculative assets like United States junk bonds, and there has even been a resurgence in Russia\u2019s stock market, which has risen 24 percent this year, in dollar terms.\u201cAt certain moments in financial markets, when things have been good, smaller catalysts can matter,\u201d said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citigroup.Some European bonds have showed signs of stress in recent days. The yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds, which moves in an opposite direction to its price, is now 2.33 percent, considerably higher than 1.79 percent a month ago. But its latest yield is still far below the levels it soared to during the last period of major stress in Europe.Some analysts are looking beyond the immediate financial repercussions of Greece\u2019s leaving the eurozone. Their bigger concern is that an exit could cause a slower-burning type of contagion. If Greece were to fall out of the eurozone, it would establish a dangerous precedent \u2014 and show that the euro is only for certain countries.If such pressure caused lasting declines in the markets of certain countries, the European Central Bank would no doubt try to intervene in defense. But even then, the stress could damp the tentative economic recoveries taking place in Europe\u2019s peripheral nations. And it is quite possible that Europe\u2019s most indebted countries, Portugal and Italy included, could suffer from anemic growth for years to come.Anytime one of those nations gets into fiscal trouble, memories of Greece\u2019s dire problems will resurface and investors will speculate about its ability to stay in the eurozone. \u201cObviously, Portugal is a sitting target if there is a Grexit,\u201d said Edward Hugh, an economist and the author of \u201cIs the Euro Crisis Really Over?\u201d using a term that describes a Greek exit. \u201cIt may not happen in one or two years, but in five years, they could force Portugal out.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}
