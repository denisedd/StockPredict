{"Headline": "Greek Markets Stumble After Face-Off With Bailout Lenders", "Date": "2015-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Stocks and bonds fell sharply in Athens on Thursday as the new Greek government\u2019s showdown with its European partners appeared to be nearing a decisive stage.The main Athens stock index fell 5.2 percent, led by a 9 percent decline in financial shares. Bond prices tumbled, with the yield on the 10-year Greek government bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, climbing above 10 percent, nearing its Jan. 30 peak of 10.8 percent.Gavriil Sakellaridis, the government spokesman, described the European Central Banks decision as \u201cpolitical\u201d and part of continuing negotiations between Greece and the country\u2019s creditors.\u201cIt is political and does not affect the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said on Greek television. \u201cWe are not blackmailing, but neither will we be blackmailed.\u201dAnti-austerity groups called for a protest outside Parliament on Thursday against the central bank\u2019s withdrawal of funding and Germany\u2019s tough stance against Greece. The slogan of the movement is: \u201cWe won\u2019t be blackmailed, we won\u2019t give in. We are not afraid, we will not go back, we\u2019re winning.\u201dMr. Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, are working to convince their European partners that it is in everyone\u2019s interest to give Greece some maneuvering room after the punishing reform program that the troika of lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 imposed in exchange for bailing out the country.On Thursday, the damage appeared to be limited to Greek markets. The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1369, while the broad European stock market was down about 0.1 percent.Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany in Frankfurt, said in a research note that the central bank\u2019s move, while a sign that it was prepared to play hardball, would in fact have limited consequences in the short term. That is because, he noted, the European Central Bank had already provided the means for Greek banks to get a lifeline from their national central bank in the form of so-called Emergency Liquidity Assistance.Mr. Varoufakis was scheduled to continue his financial diplomacy in Berlin on Thursday, meeting with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Stocks Shrug Off Faltering Talks on Greek Debt", "Date": "2015-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 European stocks fell early Tuesday, then recovered by midday despite weakness in Athens, as investors reacted to news that Greece and its European creditors appeared to have reached a fresh stalemate over whether to continue with a bailout that expires at the end of the month.The blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 0.1 percent in afternoon trading, while shares in Athens dropped 2.1 percent. Stocks were flat at the opening bell in New York.The euro was 0.5 percent stronger at $1.1414.The tone of the negotiations has grown increasingly tough, and Greece needs to reach a deal quickly if it is to unlock the \u20ac7 billion in funds it needs to meet its financial obligations.\u201cWe will not seek an extension to the memorandum, even with a gun to our head,\u201d a Greek government spokesman, Gavriil Sakellaridis, said Tuesday morning on Greek television.\u201cThe pressure, the anxiety about what is going to happen exists on the other side, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are sure of this.\u201d He added that Greece would continue negotiations to find a solution.A failure to reach an agreement could lead to a default and to the country\u2019s exit from the eurozone, an outcome that would have uncertain, but potentially dire, consequences for the currency union.Nevertheless, most investors seem to be betting that a compromise will eventually be reached.\u201cEurope wants Greece to stay and is ready to be flexible,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a research note. \u201cWe continue to expect Europe to offer face-saving compromises. But in return, the Greek government has to play by the rules. It has to realize that it cannot make the Greek economy less competitive through large-scale reform reversals and expect other European countries, some of them poorer than Greece itself, to fund such follies.\u201dStill, Mr. Schmieding said he had estimated the odds of a Greek exit from the eurozone at about 35 percent before the standoff on Monday, and that the risk of that happening \u201chas not receded, to put it mildly.\u201dStocks in Asia were little changed, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo slipping 0.1 percent from a Monday close that was the highest level in more than seven years. Australia\u2019s main share index fell 0.5 percent, while the Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 percent in Hong Kong.The uncertain situation in Europe recently pushed up Greek government debt yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, in a reflection of falling market confidence.

And the wealth, they say, is not just confined to the American coasts.Fast-growing industries, like technology and energy, are transforming cities like Houston, Dallas and San Jose, Calif., into some of the densest aggregations of wealth in the world. Since 2012, the number of high-net-worth individuals has jumped as much as 20 percent in Dallas and 18 percent in Houston, according to a Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management tally.Propelled by market gains and a skewed economic recovery, the United States\u2019 share of the world\u2019s superrich is rebounding. Since mid-2013, the number of millionaires in the United States has grown by 1.6 million, by far the biggest increase in the world and dwarfing the 90,000 Chinese who crossed the million-dollar mark since then, Credit Suisse estimates.In 2014, Americans with net wealth of more than $50 million outnumbered their Chinese counterparts eight to one. And the United States is set to remain by far the wealthiest country, Credit Suisse says, with aggregate wealth of over $114 trillion in 2019.Luxury retailers now see America\u2019s ultrarich, over Hong Kong magnates or Russian moguls, as their biggest drivers of growth.\u201cIf you look in the past year, the United States has been at the top of our investment plans,\u201d said Michele Norsa, chief executive of Salvatore Ferragamo, the Italian luxury shoemaker.\u201cThere are opportunities on the West Coast, with the tech industry there and Asian tourism,\u201d Mr. Norsa said. \u201cThere are opportunities in Miami, which is becoming important as a window to Latin America. We see opportunities not just this year, but in the long term.\u201dThe strong luxury spending is welcome news for an industry grappling with slowing growth in Europe and in emerging markets that once seemed to offer the most potential for growth, but are now hit by weaker asset prices, currency pressures and economic and political turmoil.Luxury sales in China, especially, have slowed in the face of a crackdown on bribery, and probably led to the first decline in luxury sales there in over a decade, according to Bain, the consultancy. A weak ruble and low consumer confidence have taken a toll on spending by another group of big luxury spenders: moneyed Russians.In the United States, spending on personal luxury goods rose a steady 5 percent last year to about $73 billion, Bain estimates, compared with negative growth in previous juggernauts like China and Russia.And this week\u2019s report by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world\u2019s largest luxury-goods maker, underscored the market shifts. The company said that sales in Asia dropped 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from the same period a year earlier, while sales in Europe grew 5 percent. But its bright spot was the United States, where revenue jumped 13 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new generation of 30- and 40-year-olds making millions of dollars a year in hedge funds and technology and real estate,\u201d said David Friedman, president of the wealth consultancy Wealth-X.Milton Troche, 29, whose father runs a textile company in New York, said business was looking up and that he felt flush enough to upgrade his wardrobe this year. \u201cI wanted the larger buckle,\u201d Mr. Troche said, stepping out with his $450 belt from Ferragamo\u2019s flagship store on Fifth Avenue. \u201cYou can wear a T-shirt with it, but you still get the girls.\u201dMuch of the growing wealth in America comes from equity markets that have performed well, adding to the wealth of upper-income Americans who are most likely invested in stocks. In the United States, the rich also have relatively more of their money left over to spend, because of lower top marginal income tax rates.And across America, highly skilled, high-income immigrants, of which the United States continues to attract a disproportionate share, are driving high-end consumption. The world\u2019s brain drain \u2014 and America\u2019s brain gain \u2014 is transferring more wealth and more luxury spending to America, experts said.\u201cThe U.S. is helped by wealthy immigrant flows, giving additional impulse to the luxury market in New York, Miami, even university cities like Boston,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, an expert on luxury spending at Bain.International tourism to the United States, which has grown steadily to an estimated 74 million visitors last year, has also bolstered luxury spending, experts say.Labels like Yves Saint Laurent are seeing how the American turn is paying off. The company\u2019s Paris-based parent, Kering, reported in October that luxury sales rose 3.5 percent for the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, to 1.67 billion euros ($1.91 billion), led by a 12 percent jump in North American sales.\u201cBefore, growth was really focused on the BRICS,\u201d he said, referring to the five major emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. \u201cBut the world changes constantly, and the U.S. is now a strong foundation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a market unto itself, and it\u2019s got tremendous growth,\u201d said Gerald L. Storch, chief executive of Hudson\u2019s Bay, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, which is set to open a store at Brookfield Place in the spring.Not all luxury retailers are doing well, however. The jewelry chain Tiffany cut its annual forecast last month, citing sluggish November and December sales.And economists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent report that rapid year-over-year growth in luxury spending might simply be unsustainable.\u201cHow many personal aircraft can one buy?\u201d they wrote.The weakened euro and yen also threaten to crimp tourist traffic and spending, some analysts say. (But in a sign of the strength of the American luxury consumer, European luxury brands have not been slashing prices.)Still, Brookfield\u2019s clientele is not easily affected by exchange rates, said the developer\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Friedrich. Brookfield invested $300 million to revamp the former World Financial Center.\u201cThe change in exchange rates won\u2019t dissuade them,\u201d Mr. Friedrich said. \u201cWe serve a very wealthy demographic.\u201dAn article on Feb. 7 about luxury retailers\u2019 renewed interest in the United States market misstated the fourth-quarter 2014 results of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Sales in Asia dropped 6 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, not over the full fiscal year. Fourth-quarter sales in Europe grew 5 percent, not 3 percent, over the same period a year earlier. And revenue in the United States grew 13 percent, not 8 percent, over the same period. The error was only recently called to the attention of The Times.A correction in this space on Tuesday for an article on Feb. 7 about luxury retailers\u2019 renewed interest in the United States market misstated the period during which sales in Asia dropped 6 percent for LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. They dropped that much from the same quarter a year earlier, not over the full fiscal year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are C.E.O.s That Talented, or Just Lucky?", "Date": "2015-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthThe divorce of the oil billionaire Harold G. Hamm from Sue Ann Arnall has gained attention largely for its outsize dollar amounts. Mr. Hamm, the chief executive and founder of Continental Resources, who was worth more than $18 billion at one point, wrote his ex-wife a check last month for $974,790,317.77 to settle their split. She\u2019s appealing to get more; he\u2019s appealing to pay less.Yet beyond the staggering sums, the Hamm divorce raises a fundamental question about the wealth of executives and entrepreneurs: How much do they owe their fortunes to skill and hard work, and how much comes from happenstance and luck? Mr. Hamm, seeking to exploit a wrinkle in divorce law, made the unusual argument that his wealth came largely from forces outside his control, like global oil prices, the expertise of his deputies and other people\u2019s technology. During the nine-week divorce trial, his lawyers claimed that although Mr. Hamm had founded Continental Resources and led the company to become a multibillion-dollar energy giant, he was responsible for less than 10 percent of his personal and corporate success.In a filing last month supporting his appeal, Mr. Hamm cites the recent drop in oil prices and subsequent 50 percent drop in Continental\u2019s share price and his fortune as further proof that forces outside his control direct his company\u2019s fortunes.Lawyers for Ms. Arnall argue that Mr. Hamm is responsible for more than 90 percent of his fortune.Sorting out what value is created by luck or skill is a tricky proposition in itself. The limited amount of academic research on the topic, which mainly looks at how executives can influence a company\u2019s value, has often found that broader market forces often have a bigger impact on a company\u2019s success than an executive\u2019s actions.\u201cAs we know from the research, the performance of a large firm is due primarily to things outside the control of the top executive,\u201d said J. Scott Armstrong, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe call that luck. Executives freely admit this \u2014 when they encounter bad luck.\u201dSome management experts say the role of luck is nearly impossible to measure because it depends on the particular industry. Oil, for instance, is especially sensitive to outside forces.\u201cWithin any industry, a more talented management team is going to tend to do better,\u201d said Steven Neil Kaplan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \u201cThat is why investors and boards of directors look for the best talent to run their companies. That is why company stock prices often move a lot, in both directions, when a C.E.O. dies or a new C.E.O. is hired.\u201dThe Hamm case hinged on a quirk in divorce law known as \u201cactive versus passive appreciation.\u201d In Oklahoma, and many other states, if a spouse owns an asset before the marriage, the increase in the value of an asset during marriage is not subject to division if the increase was because of \u201cpassive\u201d appreciation. Passive appreciation is when an asset grows on its own because of factors outside either spouse\u2019s control, like land that appreciates without any improvements or passively held stocks. Any value that\u2019s not deemed as \u201cpassive\u201d is considered \u201cactive\u201d \u2014 meaning it increased because of the efforts, skills or funding of a spouse and can therefore be subject to division in a divorce.The issue has been at the center of some other big divorces. In the 2002 divorce of the Chicago taxi magnate David Markin and Susan Markin, filed in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Markin claimed he was \u201cmerely a passenger on this corporate ship traveling through the ocean,\u201d according to the judge. But he ruled that Mr. Markin was more like \u201cthe captain of the ship. Certainly he benefited by sailing through some good weather. However, he picked the course and he picked the crew. In short, he was directly responsible for everything that happened.\u201d Ms. Markin was awarded more than $30 million, along with other assets.Mr. Hamm, now 69, also had favorable conditions after founding Continental Resources well before his marriage in 1988 to Sue Ann, then a lawyer at the company. By this fall, when the trial ended, Continental had a market capitalization of over $30 billion; Mr. Hamm\u2019s stake of 68 percent and other wealth exceeded $18 billion. Their divorce trial was closed to the public, and all but a few of the documents are under seal. Neither Mr. Hamm nor his lawyers or representatives would comment. Ms. Arnall and her spokesman also declined to comment.According to people with knowledge of the case, however, Mr. Hamm\u2019s chief strategy was to claim most of his wealth as passive appreciation, and therefore not subject to division. During his testimony, the typically commanding Mr. Hamm, who had been the face of the company for decades, said he couldn\u2019t recall certain decisions, didn\u2019t know much about the engineering aspects of oil drilling and didn\u2019t attend critical meetings. Mr. Hamm\u2019s lawyers calculated that only 5 to 10 percent of his wealth came from his own effort, skill, management or investment. It\u2019s unclear how they squared this argument with his compensation, which totaled $42.7 million from 2006 to 2013, according to Equilar, an executive compensation data company. Ms. Arnall called more than 80 witnesses \u2014 from Continental executives to leading economists like Glenn Hubbard and Kenneth Button \u2014 to show how much better Continental had done than its peers and that Mr. Hamm made most or all of the key decisions about the company\u2019s strategy, finances and operations. They estimated that Mr. Hamm was responsible for $14 billion to $17 billion of his $18 billion fortune.\u201cIt was surprising,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Fisher, the Florida divorce lawyer who represented Susan Markin. \u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with numbers that high, there are times when the court just says, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019\u00a0\u201dROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece to Propose a Debt Compromise Plan to Creditors", "Date": "2015-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Hoping to defuse a standoff that has set Europe and financial markets on edge, Greek officials intend to propose a detailed compromise plan at an emergency meeting with creditors on Wednesday in Brussels, a finance ministry official here said on Monday.The plan will include the possibility of tapping part of a bailout loan disbursement of 7 billion euros, or $7.9 billion, that Athens had been saying it would reject, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity because the plans had not yet been made public.Greece still plans to reject some of the harshest austerity conditions attached to Greece\u2019s bailout loans, but will propose retaining about 70 percent of the terms, according to the official.Athens will propose replacing the remaining 30 percent of the austerity conditions with new reforms that the Greek government will devise together with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The O.E.C.D. represents about three dozen of the world\u2019s richest economies, including those of many of the European countries to which Greece owes money.The proposal, to be made at a gathering of eurozone finance ministers on Wednesday in Brussels, would also significantly extend the period Greece proposes for reaching a \u201cnew contract\u201d with its creditors \u2014 by asking for a bridge-financing program through the end of August, instead of the May time frame Greek officials had previously discussed.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany appeared to show little leeway on Monday. \u201cThe basic rules\u201d of the Greek bailout program \u201chave always been the same,\u201d she said at a joint news conference with President Obama in Washington. \u201cYou put in your own efforts and on the other side you\u2019re being shown solidarity. A quid pro quo.\u201dMr. Obama, who last week warned Europe not to press too hard on austerity, said he was anticipating Ms. Merkel\u2019s appraisal and hoped Europe would find ways to improve growth.\u201cI look forward to hearing Angela\u2019s assessment of how Europe and the I.M.F. can work with the new Greek government to find a way that returns Greece to sustainable growth within the eurozone,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the news conference, noting that European growth was important for the global economy and the United States. The International Monetary Fund is one of Greece\u2019s creditors.On Monday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission \u2014 the executive arm of the European Union \u2014 said in Brussels that \u201cGreece should not assume that the overall mood has so changed that the eurozone will adopt Tsipras\u2019s government program unconditionally.\u201dThe Athens stock exchange slumped on Monday\u2019s tensions, with bank stocks falling as much as 14 percent. The yield on Greek three-year government bonds \u2014 a debt security of which Mr. Tsipras wants to issue more often to cover Greece\u2019s financing needs \u2014 surged to 21.74 percent, the highest since July. If yields stayed at that level, the Greek government could find new borrowing unaffordable.Greek government officials, for their part, say they do not believe European officials will let Greece go bankrupt or leave the European Union \u2014 a fate Mr. Tsipras has said he also wants to avoid. The eurozone could collapse \u201clike a house of cards\u201d if that were to happen, Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s new finance minister, warned on Sunday in an interview on Italian television.Greece\u2019s creditors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. \u2014 want the government to seek an extension beyond Feb. 28 of the European portion of the \u20ac240 billion bailout. But the government has been saying it is not interested in the latest portion of the bailout, the loan of \u20ac7 billion, because of what it sees as conditions that have hurt average Greeks.The apparent reversal of that position on Monday comes as Greece is running low on cash as well as time to pay off a looming series of debts. The official said Greece would also ask its European Union partners on Wednesday for the right to issue about \u20ac8 billion of further short-term debt above a current \u20ac15 billion limit. The government would further seek permission to raise the amount of money that Greek banks can tap under an emergency liquidity assistance program. There have been signs that capital has been fleeing Greek bank accounts.Greece will also ask its European creditors to give it \u20ac1.9 billion in profits that they have made on their holdings of Greek bonds, the official said, and propose that some \u20ac11 billion euros in residual funding from the recapitalization of Greek banks be used to help Greek lenders deal with nonperforming loans.The Greek government also plans to pledge that it will crack down on tax evasion and corruption.Among other measures, Greek officials will ask creditors to agree that the country's \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d be addressed by allowing the new government to roll back a series of austerity measures that Mr. Tsipras outlined Sunday, including increasing some low-level pensions by the end of the year, immediately restoring collective wage bargaining and bringing unions back into negotiations on workers\u2019 salaries and working conditions.The government will also push for the minimum wage to gradually be restored to \u20ac751 a month, up from \u20ac586 currently.At least one key European official indicated on Monday that Greece might continue to meet a skeptical audience among its creditors. If Greece wants to buy time by arranging some sort of bridge financing, it must still submit to an internationally supervised program of economic reforms, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, said at a meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers on Monday in Istanbul.\u201cWithout a program, things will be tough for Greece,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how financial markets will handle it without a program, but maybe he knows better,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Tsipras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Hedge Fund Returns Falter, Money Continues to Flow In", "Date": "2015-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseEven as their high fees have minted scores of new billionaires, hedge funds have now substantially underperformed a simple blend of index funds \u2014 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds \u2014 for three-, five- and 10-year periods. And the 10-year numbers cover the period of the financial crisis and the sharp decline in stocks \u2014 the very calamity that hedge funds are supposed to protect against.No wonder Calpers, the giant California retirement system, withdrew from hedge funds last year. I assumed that by now, many other big pension funds and institutions would be following its lead.On the contrary. Large investors are still pouring money into hedge funds. They added $1 billion during January and more than $88 billion in 2014, according to data compiled by the investment consultancy eVestment. Total hedge fund assets are now over $3 trillion.Weak performance notwithstanding, \u201cInvestor interest in hedge funds has been continuously accelerating since the financial crisis,\u201d said Peter Laurelli, vice president for research at eVestment, \u201cand it has really picked up during the past two years.\u201dSimon Lack, founder of the financial consultancy SL Advisors and author of \u201cThe Hedge Fund Mirage,\u201d said, \u201cI would have expected Calpers to have had a bigger impact.\u201d That it hasn\u2019t is a testament to hedge fund marketing and a sales pitch that, stripped of its often technical jargon, promises what has always been the holy grail of investing: higher returns with lower risk. Some hedge funds go so far as to promise higher returns with what is essentially zero risk \u2014 something, it seems worth noting, that has never been achieved in human history.Mr. Laurelli mentioned two factors driving the trend: still-agonizing memories of the financial crisis and the persistent low interest rate environment. While the sales pitches for different hedge fund strategies vary, many funds promise to address both issues by blunting the impact of another market crash, while generating higher returns than United States Treasury bonds.Investors \u201cendured the financial crisis, but it\u2019s very daunting to face the prospect of going through that again,\u201d Mr. Laurelli said. \u201cThey need to make sure their portfolios are better designed to weather an environment like that. At the same time, bond yields are about as low as they\u2019ve ever been in history, and valuations in equity markets are perceived as high or at least fully valued. You can say a 60/40 strategy has done great the past few years, but can you risk relying on that going forward?\u201d For many investment officers, the answer is clearly \u201cno.\u201dAnd Mr. Lack noted that few pension fund advisers were making any counterarguments. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in being against hedge funds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a consultant and say, \u2018Put it in Vanguard,\u2019 they won\u2019t need you anymore.\u201dBy now, it probably goes without saying that there\u2019s plenty of money to made in the hedge fund industry. Not only do the funds themselves charge high fees, typically 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains, but an entire multibillion-dollar industry of brokerage services, data collection and consultants has grown up to serve them and their investors.Institutions are not only pouring more money into hedge funds, but they also appear to be engaging in a classic pattern of many individual investors, which is to chase returns and shun losers. Last year, investor money surged into so-called event-driven strategies, like those pursued by the activist investors William Ackman and Daniel Loeb, who have had a string of recent successes. (A net $42.5 billion flowed into event-driven strategies, according to eVestment.) And after six months of strong results after years of underperformance, managed futures strategies (which make bets on commodities and other futures contracts) gained $4 billion in January alone.At the same time, long-short equity strategies (funds that take both long and short positions in stocks) faced $7.5 billion in net outflows in January after far underperforming the S.&P. 500 in 2014.\u201cMost hedge fund investors are momentum investors,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cThe only data they have is performance data, so they chase returns. You don\u2019t have many consultants out there saying you should invest in out-of-favor hedge funds. But there\u2019s never going to be a good outcome with that approach. There\u2019s an enormous amount of research that shows hedge fund returns aren\u2019t persistent. They revert to the mean. Of all the hedge funds I looked at, only 7 percent were consistently in the top 40 percent. What chance do you have of picking them?\u201dOf course, some large investors have shown unusual skill (or luck) at picking hedge funds and have far outperformed the averages, which would be expected in any bell curve distribution of outcomes. The Texas County and District Retirement System has earned 9.1 percent, 9.4 percent and 7.4 percent over one-, three- and five-year periods. Hedge funds now account for about a quarter of the fund\u2019s $24.4 billion in assets, the system says.I contacted several large pension funds and endowments this week that have been putting money into hedge funds. Few were willing to discuss, for attribution, their reasoning, but all cited the factors that Mr. Laurelli identified, with fear of another financial crisis foremost among them.The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which manages over $100 billion, allocated about 2 percent of its assets to hedge funds in 2011 and is increasing its commitment, even though its hedge funds returned just 3.7 percent last year and generated an annualized return of 4.8 percent over the last three years. Citing the trauma of the financial crisis, a spokeswoman said that the investment board\u2019s goal with hedge funds was to reduce risk, not generate high returns, and that the hedge funds had exceeded their target benchmark for both periods.Others I spoke to cited data suggesting that hedge funds have a lower standard deviation, a measure of risk, and higher risk-adjusted returns than stocks. But Mr. Lack warned that such data is necessarily backward-looking and does not account for the larger amounts of capital now invested in hedge funds. When he wrote his book in 2012, \u201cI said hedge funds were overcapitalized and returns would go down, which is exactly what has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best funds know this, which is why they\u2019re closed to new investors.\u201dHedge funds also benefit from a premise that won\u2019t be put to the test until another bear market sets in, which hasn\u2019t happened since 2008. During the financial crisis, hedge funds, on average, didn\u2019t perform all that well and lost substantial sums, but still performed significantly better than the S.&P. 500.But presumably pension funds and endowments have near-infinite time horizons. That means they can ride out volatility and still come out ahead with a 60/40 mix, as the 10-year data now suggests would have happened had they stuck with such a strategy though the crisis. But this argument, too, has been falling on deaf ears.\u201cThe 60/40 strategy does cost real money\u201d if asset values drop significantly but payments are fixed or rise, Mr. Laurelli said. \u201cSo, yes, in the long term, you might be O.K. riding it out with 60/40, but there are near-term implications if you face a serious drawdown.\u201dOf course, how today\u2019s ever-growing universe of hedge funds will perform in the next crisis remains to be seen. Unlike United States stocks and bonds, they are lightly regulated. They aren\u2019t that transparent. Many aren\u2019t that liquid.But not even a critic like Mr. Lack expects a hedge fund catastrophe. \u201cThey take less risk nowadays because that\u2019s what their investors are asking for,\u201d he said. \u201cSo hedge funds aren\u2019t the most likely place for a blowup. There will just be endless mediocrity year after year delivered at great expense.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Debt Diplomacy Doesn\u2019t Sell Well in Germany", "Date": "2015-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 An attempt by Greece to shift the country\u2019s debt narrative away from austerity ran into a wall of inflexibility during a two-day trip to Germany.German officials here on Thursday, like European Central Bank officials the day before in Frankfurt, offered no sign that they considered the recent change of government in Greece to be an opportunity for a fresh start.Instead, the message after meetings in which both sides grasped for common ground was that the same rules still apply. On Thursday, the Greek and German finance ministers even failed to reach an agreement on whether or not they disagreed.It was a lesson in eurozone realpolitik for Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s new finance minister. After a private meeting on Thursday with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, who is regarded as Europe\u2019s chief enforcer of the austerity doctrine, the two men struggled to come up with even the public platitudes of harmony that usually follow such meetings.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble told reporters afterward they had agreed to disagree. But Mr. Varoufakis disagreed.\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree to disagree,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis retorted. \u201cWe agreed to enter into a discussion for a joint solution for all European partners.\u201dThe exchange reflected the gulf that divides the two men, not only on their political positions, but also their personalities \u2014 which might also be emblematic of the divergent cultures of the countries they represent. The stark differences would seem to bode ill for the chances that Greece could negotiate new, easier terms for the billions in financial aid it needs to avoid bankruptcy and, in the worst case, an exit from the eurozone.But it is entirely incongruous to the staid political environment in which Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, a 72-year-old political veteran, operates. Although Mr. Varoufakis on Thursday praised Mr. Sch\u00e4uble as a European statesman whom he has followed since the 1980s, the German finance minister is widely viewed in Greece as the country\u2019s nemesis.The one common theme in the Greek and German finance ministers\u2019 remarks on Thursday was their commitment to preserving the unity of Europe and its common currency. But experts were skeptical that Mr. Varoufakis had been able to persuade the Germans that Greece deserves more time to renegotiate the terms of its bailout, worth 240 billion euros, about $274 billion.\u201cIt looks pretty much like a disaster for him,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist of ING-DiBa bank in Frankfurt, said of the Greek minister\u2019s overture.The message from both Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and the European Central Bank the day before, Mr. Brzeski said, was: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to play according to your rules. You\u2019re going to play according to our rules. And then maybe we\u2019ll talk.\u201dIn a joint news conference after they met privately here on Thursday, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, who helped to draw up the bailout agreement, sought to praise his new counterpart. He stressed their common desire to find a solution to Europe\u2019s economic woes and described their talks as \u201copen and intense.\u201d But Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said there had been no discussion of debt reduction or timing of the Greek payment.Berlin\u2019s role is just as crucial to Greece. Germany is the largest holder of Greek debt among eurozone countries. And the regimen of austerity budgets that have been a condition of Greece\u2019s receiving bailout loans \u2014 and that the new Greek government blames it for the country\u2019s battered economy and high unemployment \u2014 has long been supported by Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel.Germany is the eurozone\u2019s fiscal enforcer, largely responsible for imposing severe spending restrictions on Greece and other countries that became overly indebted before the financial crisis began in 2007. Many Germans regard Greeks as the most fiscally irresponsible on the Continent and think they must now suffer the consequences.Despite backing off from his election campaign demanding a reduction in the country\u2019s debt, Mr. Varoufakis has nevertheless pushed to find a way to ease the economic pain for average Greeks. He proposed a bridging program until the end of May to allow the new government time to draw up a new proposal for handling the country\u2019s debts. The current program will expire on Feb. 28.In impassioned remarks, Mr. Varoufakis sought to appeal to Germany\u2019s sense of morality, drawing a parallel between Greece\u2019s problems and Germany\u2019s economic crisis of the 1930s that helped pave the way for the rise of the Nazi party and World War II.\u201cI think that the German nation is the one nation in Europe that can understand us better than anyone else,\u201d Mr. Varoufakis said.As a sign of the newly hopeful public mood in Greece that the new government could secure a better deal, about 7,000 people staged a peaceful anti-austerity demonstration on Thursday outside Parliament in Athens. It was the first such protest in years without riot police standing by.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, in his own remarks on Thursday, sought to make clear that the Germans had not shifted from their original position that Greece must uphold its existing commitments to its international creditors, saying more than once that, \u201cReliability is the prerequisite for trust.\u201dAs the financial markets absorbed the Greek news, stocks in Athens on Thursday shuddered early, but regained some of the lost ground in late trading, closing down 3.3 percent for the day.But bond prices stabilized, with the yield on the 10-year Greek government bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, edging down to 9.33 percent, after climbing above 10 percent earlier in the day. That neared its recent peak of 10.8 percent on Jan. 30, in the wake of the Greek election.The divergence of Greece and Germany\u2019s economic fortunes is stark. Germany has the lowest unemployment rate in the euro currency bloc, at 4.8 percent, while Greece\u2019s at 25.8 percent is the highest.Germany has a budget surplus and can sell government bonds at negative interest rates, meaning that investors essentially pay for the privilege of lending money to that government as a safe way to store their money. Greece, meanwhile, is still trying to create a functioning tax-collection system and has the highest debt in the eurozone as measured as a percentage of gross domestic product.While Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, a senior member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats, kept to the party line, Mr. Varoufakis on Thursday found a more sympathetic ear in Sigmar Gabriel, who is Germany\u2019s economy and energy minister and leader of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Mr. Gabriel urged for a fresh program to be drawn up for Greece before the current one expires.\u201cI think this is in all of our interests,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said after the meeting.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "Can a Stock-Trader-Turned-Convict Start a New Life?", "Date": "2015-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day in the middle of 2008, Sakhawat Khan, a Silicon Valley chip engineer, walked into a small house near the back of his two-acre property that his wife, Roomy, a stock trader, used as a home office. Roomy and Sakhawat met when they were electrical-engineering students at Columbia University. After graduating, Sakhawat started inventing, eventually gathering some 30 semiconductor patents to his name. Roomy, who was more outgoing in social situations and more restless in her appetite for risk, was drawn to Wall Street and joined Galleon Group, a New York hedge fund run by the charismatic, bullish trader Raj Rajaratnam. In 1999, she struck out on her own to trade technology stocks. She thrived. Riding the Internet boom, she said, she had amassed a paper fortune of $50 million.When Sakhawat visited Roomy in her office, her eyes were usually fixed on a large Bloomberg terminal, her ear pressed to the phone. But that morning when Sakhawat entered, he found his wife sitting at a large glass-topped table next to an open drawer containing a tape recorder and two phone jacks.\u201cWhat are you doing taping?\u201d Sakhawat asked.\u201cYou know my boss is not good with bonuses, so I want to track the information I give him,\u201d Roomy replied.This was just one of the many lies she told. Since January 2008, as Roomy had ostensibly been going about her usual business \u2014 analyzing companies, gathering snippets of privileged corporate intelligence and deciding which stocks to buy and sell \u2014 she was secretly assisting the F.B.I. in a long-running investigation into insider trading at Wall Street hedge funds. Khan was the right woman for the job: Since about 2006, she herself had been trading on inside information. When the F.B.I. caught up with her, she began helping them \u2014 at first reluctantly and then with theatrical flair. She taped telephone calls with her bosses, business associates and even a neighbor. Most important of all, she taped calls with her ex-boss, Raj Rajaratnam, whom the government had been eyeing for a decade.On the morning of Oct. 16, 2009, Wall Street awoke to images of Rajaratnam flanked by F.B.I. agents outside a federal courthouse, looking subdued and sour, with his hands cuffed behind his back. He had been charged by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan with conspiracy and securities fraud.Reading newspaper reports about the case, Sakhawat realized that the F.B.I. informant referred to as C.W. (cooperating witness) in the 34-page complaint against Rajaratnam had to be his wife. C.W.\u2019s recorded telephone calls with Rajaratnam suggested that he had access to inside information, enabling the government to obtain court permission to place a wiretap on his cellphone. It was the first time prosecutors had made significant use of wiretaps to investigate white-collar crime, and conversations intercepted from Rajaratnam\u2019s cellphone led the authorities to uncover the biggest insider-trading network in American history. (He is serving an 11-year sentence.)It took only a few days for friends and associates of C.W.\u2019s many targets to unmask Khan. Within hours of the discovery, the press assailed her as \u201cThe Woman Who Ratted on Rajaratnam\u201d and \u201cThe Nark in Galleon Bust.\u201d In photographs, she was portrayed as disheveled and sinister. Incriminating episodes from her past were splashed across major newspapers. She and Sakhawat, it was revealed, had been sued by Deutsche Bank for failing to pay off a large promissory note (they later settled). A few years later, their housekeeper accused the Khans of violating labor laws by paying her $250 a week for 80 to 90 hours of work. They also settled a lawsuit with her after a judge said they had doctored evidence.The gleeful bad-mouthing of Khan went on for years: Her flamboyance and her lying made for delectable reading, especially when it emerged that Khan had not been entirely truthful with the F.B.I. Even after she started cooperating, she manipulated them. Suspecting that Khan had been tipped off to the imminent takeover of Hilton Worldwide, investigators confronted her about shares she had purchased. Khan said she bought them because she thought the jailing of Paris Hilton would be good publicity for the brand. She also took out a cellphone contract in her gardener\u2019s name so she could continue speaking to some of her contacts. She claims she wanted to protect them from the government\u2019s prying; she also wanted to continue making legitimate money playing the markets.Khan\u2019s cooperation did not keep her out of jail. Sentencing her to a year at a women\u2019s prison in Coleman, Fla., near Orlando, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the federal court in Manhattan admonished her: \u201cYou cannot have it both ways. You cannot obstruct justice and then say, \u2018Well, because I have done good things since, forget about it.\u2019\u2009\u201d Before going to jail, Khan spent her mornings walking along the beach, worrying about how she\u2019d survive in prison. But as she learned serving out her term: \u201cPrison is the easiest part. When you get out and there is nothing there \u2014 that is the toughest part.\u201dKhan was wary of me. She felt bruised by the way the media had demonized her. All but one of her friends from her California days had abandoned her. Since moving to Florida, she has channeled her energies into raising her only child, her adopted daughter, Priyanka. \u201cI have no outside-world connections,\u201d she told me. Oddly, she was worried that if she agreed to be interviewed for an article, people might think she was paid for her story. (The New York Times does not pay for interviews.) After vetting the idea with her lawyer and her probation officer, she agreed to sit down and tell me about her life.I had seen so many unattractive photographs of Khan that I was surprised when a spunky woman with large, lively eyes and carefully blow-dried hair bounded up to me in my hotel lobby. Khan, who is about 5-foot-2 and svelte, was dressed in a loosefitting cotton blouse and skinny jeans and carried a horseshoe-shaped, fuchsia Louis Vuitton bag and an iPad on which she tracks a handful of stocks \u2014 Apple, Caterpillar and Cummins. She said she has no money to invest. \u201cI do it for the intellectual curiosity. Otherwise my mind would be mush.\u201dKhan is financially reliant on Sakhawat, who now has a business that manufactures tents in Bangladesh. He has remained loyal to Roomy, but she finds her dependence on him distressing. Khan told me that she hasn\u2019t let go of the sheer pleasure she derives from dropping thousands of dollars on fine things. She vowed she would go straight \u201cto a Louis Vuitton and blow $10,000\u201d if she ever found work. \u201cWhy? Because it makes me feel alive. I can\u2019t change my wiring.\u201d During my visit, she showed me a closet filled with some of her former trophies: designer handbags and shoes. She lovingly stroked a black leather Valentino handbag adorned with delicate lace flowers. \u201cValentino is my favorite brand,\u201d she said, as giddy as a teenage girl.Khan was born in 1958 into a traditional middle-class family. In January, I met her parents in Delhi, where Khan was raised. Her father, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, did research on weapons systems for India\u2019s department of defense. Her mother, though trained as a linguist, was a homemaker. In India, many parents whose children have managed to make a life abroad regard the achievement as their own and affect a highhanded snobbery, but hers struck me as down to earth.Khan\u2019s parents valued education above all else. Her father showered as much attention on his daughter as he did on his son, a level of interest that was unusual in India at the time, and Khan sensed that it was because she showed more promise. But schooling two children strained the family\u2019s finances. When Khan was 9 or 10, her parents pulled her out of Rosary, a private school in Delhi where students were taught English. At the state school Khan subsequently attended, almost all her classes were in Hindi except for science. \u201cI went to college, and I barely knew English,\u201d she told me. She hung around the English speakers at college and kept silent, listening so that she could speak like them.In 1981, when Khan was 23, she saw an advertisement in a journal about studying abroad at Kent State. She applied to the university\u2019s physics program, and when Kent State offered her a partial scholarship, she leapt at the chance, telling her parents that if they didn\u2019t give her the money for the ticket, she would borrow it. In America, her ambitions grew. Bored with studying in a small, provincial town in Ohio, she applied and was accepted to Columbia University\u2019s master\u2019s program in engineering, where she met Sakhawat, a Muslim from Bangladesh. In 1985, she followed him to California, defying her parents, who are Hindu and disapproved of her choice. \u201cYes, we lived together in sin for a couple of years,\u201d Khan said, laughing.The two struck up a friendship after that, dining together sometimes when Rajaratnam visited California. Though heavyset and not particularly attractive, Rajaratnam was charming \u2014 perhaps the brightest man Khan had ever met, she told me. Khan, eager to break into Wall Street, saw Rajaratnam as her ticket out of Intel. She tried to please him, faxing him confidential data on the number of computer chips the company shipped, giving him a glimpse into Intel\u2019s revenue for the quarter. In early 1998, her employer installed a video camera above the fax machine and captured Khan\u2019s stealthy communications with Rajaratnam. She quit before the company had completed their internal investigation into her crime. Her next job was working for Rajaratnam at his new hedge fund, the Galleon Group.As Khan was starting her career trading technology stocks, the business was about to undergo major changes. In 2000, just before the Internet bubble lost oxygen, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to introduce Regulation Fair Disclosure, which required publicly traded companies to share crucial information with all investors simultaneously. Before Regulation F.D., companies routinely held one-on-one meetings with hedge-fund managers or investment analysts, at which the companies offered guidance on earnings or provided information about the success of a new product rollout that could have an impact on their bottom line. The culture, especially in Silicon Valley, was chummy, with nascent technology companies vying to attract Wall Street\u2019s attention.But after Regulation F.D. came into effect, companies became more guarded about divulging information. Some hedge funds, which make money from specific events, like a takeover or an earnings report, had relied on their relationships with companies for insights. The change in Regulation F.D. hurt them, and it came at a moment when the number of hedge funds was growing and competition was becoming fiercer. According to Hedge Fund Research, a group that follows the industry, at the end of 1990, there were 610 hedge funds globally; at the end of 2001, there were 4,454. More regulation, heightened competition and tougher markets meant that hedge-fund managers were always seeking new advantages.In 1999, after nearly a year of working for Rajaratnam, Khan quit Galleon, wanting to start trading her own money in the Internet-stock boom. A month into trading solo, she was visited by F.B.I. agents, who confronted her with the evidence from her indiscretions at Intel. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and for the next four years, chastened by her crime, she says, she played by the rules and steered clear of Rajaratnam.Then one day in 2005, \u201cout of the blue, I got a call as I was driving to my house,\u201d she recalled. \u201cRaj said: \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t heard from you. How are you?\u2019 Then he gave me some skinny on the quarter at Intel.\u201dRajaratnam\u2019s call came at a time when Khan needed money; within a few years of the Internet bust in 2001, she had lost $49.6 million, according to her lawyer. The Khans paid cash for the Atherton house, but after the meltdown, they took out a $5 million mortgage on it. To pay it, Khan needed to generate $42,000 a month. But it wasn\u2019t only a sense of financial need that led her back to Rajaratnam; Khan\u2019s thinking about her earlier run-in with the law was starting to change. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you are a drug addict, and you go through rehab, and you are clean,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then you are constantly at a party every day where people are doing cocaine. How long can you stay clean?\u201d She was struck by the pervasiveness of insider trading on Wall Street and the extent to which skilled traders bent the rules and took calculated risks by defying the law.At Intel, she had broken the rules by supplying inside information to someone else; now she was willing to use it to make money for herself. Khan began tapping her vast network, leaning on friends, associates and even a cousin to find new avenues of information. She made inroads into Silicon Valley\u2019s close-knit South Asian community, mixing business and pleasure to her advantage. She invited Sunil Bhalla, an executive at Polycom who was dating one of her close friends, to her home for a holiday dinner in December 2005; a few weeks later, she followed up to ask how his company\u2019s quarter was looking. She played auntie to a young woman from Bangladesh who worked for an investor-relations company. Before long, the woman was feeding her information on Google, one of the firm\u2019s clients, and asking for money in exchange (Khan never paid her). Because Khan had been trading on her own, she often wasn\u2019t invited to one-on-one meetings with company executives like other money managers. \u201cThat is how you garner all your nuggets in a legal way,\u201d she said. She would talk to a young investment analyst she knew in New York named Tom Hardin. \u201cTom was my buddy,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe used to barter information all the time.\u201dFrom time to time, when Khan picked up a juicy bit from Bhalla or her young investor-relations friend, she would call Rajaratnam and pass it along. In 2005, she landed a job at a hedge fund, Trivium, and she liked that Rajaratnam would share information with her that she could pass on to her new bosses. She also hoped by ingratiating herself with Rajaratnam that he might hire her again.Khan had been maniacal about covering her tracks, registering cellphones under false names and paying off a source through an intermediary. But she was sloppy once. Two years earlier, she was receiving insider tips on Polycom\u2019s earnings from Bhalla. Distracted by the lawsuit with Deutsche Bank and fighting with her housekeeper, she called Bhalla on his cellphone and his home phone. The feds obtained these phone records and discovered that conversations between Khan and Bhalla followed an incriminating instant message Khan sent Rajaratnam: \u201cdo not buy plcm till I het guidance.\u201d When investigators showed Khan that they had the instant-message exchange, she knew she would have to come clean. \u201cWith Polycom, I felt I couldn\u2019t really lie, because they had the phone communications.\u201d (When the S.E.C. later sued Bhalla, he denied tipping Khan and reached a settlement.)After the agents left Khan\u2019s house, she found a lawyer, who advised her to cooperate with the federal investigation. But she figured she could outwit the F.B.I. \u2014 she had, after all, gotten off without jail time after her Intel indiscretion, and the government still hadn\u2019t managed to prosecute Rajaratnam.During her regular trips to New York to meet with prosecutors, she avoided contact with Rajaratnam. \u201cI knew he was the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my mind, their target was Raj, and I was not going to get in their way.\u201d But she went out of her way to warn others. Once, when Khan was going to meet with prosecutors in New York, she sought out her buddy Tom Hardin. \u201cListen, the S.E.C. is asking about the Hilton trade,\u201d she told him. \u201cHave a story.\u201d Khan was so intent on protecting Hardin that at one point, she says, an F.B.I. agent screamed at her: \u201cWhat does Tom Hardin mean to you?\u201d (Hardin later pleaded guilty to insider trading.)Khan insists that she was driven by a desire to shield people: \u201cThey were all young kids. Some of them were my relatives. Because of the kind of relationship I had with them and how young they were, I was aghast that I was going to destroy their lives.\u201d She continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie for myself. I really lied for other people, which is very stupid. Everybody knew what they were doing. When someone working at an institution like Moody\u2019s comes and asks you for money, they know that is not what they should be doing.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to know what Khan\u2019s real motives were, but I tended to believe her expressions of sympathy for her young, ambitious colleagues, her guilt at exposing their wrongdoing in a climate of widespread rule-breaking. She spoke about the extreme temptations of making sure bets on stock trades. When we met, she\u2019d been closely watching Caterpillar and Cummins stocks. If she were still in the business of playing the markets, she said, she would have tried to short Caterpillar and go long, or take a bullish bet, on Cummins. If she\u2019d put in the trade a few days earlier, she would have made $4 or $5 a share on the Caterpillar short position, \u201cwhich is not bad,\u201d she said. So why, I asked her, had she resorted to insider trading when there was ample money to be made through good old-fashioned stock analysis?\u201cDo you think I would bet $1 million on my analysis?\u201d she said, with a look of mock disdain. \u201cBut if someone told me Caterpillar is going to miss its quarter, I would bet $1 million. Insider trading introduces certainty.\u201d That certainty felt like magic: A little money, with the press of a button, could become a heap of money. It\u2019s a temptation that has taken Khan much of her life to learn to resist.The 2,500-square-foot mustard yellow house sits close to a busy intersection and is the same size as the maid\u2019s quarters in Khan\u2019s former residence in Atherton. Paint was peeling from the ceiling in the kitchen. In the living room, unironed shirts were slung over chairs, and papers were strewn across a table. A broken toilet gurgled upstairs.The only vestiges of her former life were a couple of imposing and rather austere works of modern art and expensive pieces of furniture that crowded the rooms. She pointed to a stainless-steel credenza that barely fit across one wall in the dining area. It cost $20,000. I asked about the long brown couch that swallowed up most of the living room. She thought she paid between $10,000 and $15,000 for it.When I visited, Khan was a week away from celebrating her 56th birthday. She seemed addled, struggling to fashion a new identity for herself. Khan has worked since she was 27. When she was trading stocks on her own, she started her days at 6 in the morning and worked till 8 at night. \u201cEven when we had the big money, I worked,\u201d she told me. What bothered her the most, she said, is that \u201cthe thing that has made me has been taken away from me.\u201d Her probation officer suggested she find work as a cashier, but Khan believes she is capable of more.In December, Khan took the G.R.E.s and scored fairly well. She applied to the Ph.D. program in finance at the Wharton School, among others. She wants to focus on insider trading and white-collar fraud. \u201cI will not be a typical Wharton Ph.D. program student,\u201d she wrote in her Wharton application essay. \u201cHowever my life experiences, although extreme, have prepared me uniquely to do research on insider trading/ethics.\u201dIn February, she received a rejection, but she\u2019s waiting to hear from several other schools. If she doesn\u2019t get in anywhere, she would like to write a book, perhaps go on the lecture circuit, sharing with aspiring traders and business people the cautionary tale of her easy slide into committing crimes. Addressing an issue many South Asians have raised with me about the Galleon prosecutions, Khan said flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a racial angle. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with us being Indians. I got in trouble because of my association with Raj, and Raj got in trouble because of his braggadocio.\u201d When I asked her what she thought about the fact that the leaders of the major banks who bear the most responsibility for the financial crisis in 2008 haven\u2019t been prosecuted for their crimes, she answered with her usual pragmatism: The government likes to bring cases it can win.On my last day in Fort Lauderdale, Khan and I took a walk among the tall palm trees that line the beach near her house. Khan was in a reflective mood. She told me that her sister-in-law from Bangladesh said to her: \u201cBhabi,\u201d a term used to address an older brother\u2019s wife, \u201cdon\u2019t think of what you\u2019ve lost. Think of what you have, and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d For the first time, she is trying to embrace that advice. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is I will be a housewife for the rest of my life,\u201d she told me. Then she added: \u201cI am very fortunate. I am not homeless. I still have a life.\u201dAnita Raghavan is the author of \u201cThe Billionaire\u2019s Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surviving the Perils of the Quest for Higher Yield ", "Date": "2015-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout the last year, frustrated investors who have sought to increase their income through alternative investments have been warned about adding risk to their portfolios.Now comes another downside: tax headaches.Financial advisers often give several standard warnings about such investments. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s a bad idea to load up on high-yielding securities for income because you\u2019re taking on more risk than you should,\u201d said Gregg S. Fisher, founder of the investment management firm Gerstein Fisher. Then \u201cthere\u2019s the \u2018pain in the neck\u2019 factor to consider,\u201d he said.These publicly traded investments are, for the most part, involved in the storage or transport of commodities and energy resources, which makes them sensitive to shifts in oil prices. For example, as crude oil prices sank by more than 50 percent starting last June, the Alerian M.L.P. index lost 12 percent of its value, after gaining nearly 40 percent in the previous two years.Investors in these partnerships now face the additional annoyance of handling the tax paperwork.The partnerships have some tax advantages. These investments are largely \u201cpass-through entities,\u201d which means the partnership itself is not taxed on the income it generates, as long as that income is passed on to the underlying partners, who may be liable for tax.Moreover, much of that distribution to shareholders will be considered a return of capital and will not be taxed until the partnership units are sold. And when they are sold, they are likely to be subject to capital gains taxes, which are capped at 20 percent for those in the highest income tax bracket, versus 39.6 percent for ordinary income. In addition, there is a 3.8 percent surtax from the Affordable Care Act.That\u2019s the good news.The bad is that investors who own partnership shares directly, and not through a fund, will receive complicated K-1 forms instead of the basic 1099 forms that come with a traditional bond fund. K-1 forms are not just more complex. They are often mailed later than 1099s, which might keep an investor from filing taxes by the April 15 deadline.What\u2019s more, investors may have to file multiple nonresident tax returns. \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing with an M.L.P. with wells or pipelines in a number of states, you will probably have to file in several states,\u201d said Gregory K. Hinkle, treasurer of the T. Rowe Price funds. \u201cMost states will then allow you, on your resident tax return, to file for a credit on the tax you paid to those other states,\u201d Mr. Hinkle said. But that is yet more paperwork.Investors who are frustrated by the tedium of taxes on master limited partnerships may decide to try to avoid it by gaining exposure to the partnerships through a fund. This creates further complications, however: Funds with more than a 25 percent weighting in master limited partnerships (or other qualified publicly traded partnerships) will most likely have to be structured as C corporations.And C corporation funds must pay taxes on whatever distributions are made by the underlying partnerships in their portfolios. Furthermore, the taxes a fund pays at the corporate level are then reflected in a lower net asset value, which means they are a drag on performance.\u201cIn effect, the corporate level tax is a convenience fee for avoiding a tax headache,\u201d Mr. Hinkle said.Yet that could be a hefty fee. Over the last three years, Alerian M.L.P. E.T.F. has returned 6.8 percent annually, more than three percentage points less a year than the average energy limited partnership, according to Morningstar.Like master limited partnerships, REITs are pass-through entities, though the tax treatment for REIT payouts is much simpler.Most of the distributions that a REIT pays to shareholders are likely to be treated as ordinary income, which is less appealing than long-term capital gains.In this regard REITs are tax disadvantaged and therefore are better held in tax-deferred accounts, like 401(k) retirement plans.Yet while bond funds are available in virtually all 401(k) plans, REITs are available in only about one-third of such accounts.Foreign bonds pose problems of their own. Typically, investors are advised to hold their bonds in tax-deferred accounts because bond income is treated as ordinary income. But this is not so with foreign bonds, said Lewis J. Altfest, chief executive of Altfest Personal Wealth Management.He noted that the income paid by foreign bonds might be subject to withholding taxes from foreign governments. For instance, Britain withholds 20 percent in taxes on interest, as does Indonesia and the Philippines.American investors have a couple of options to avoid being taxed twice on this foreign bond income. If the bonds are held in a taxable account, they can claim a foreign tax credit or deduct the withholdings. While taking a deduction is easier, going with the tax credit will ensure a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the investor\u2019s tax obligation. \u201cYet you cannot do either if the foreign bonds are held in your tax-deferred retirement account,\u201d Mr. Altfest said.But if investors keep their foreign bonds in a taxable account, another wrinkle arises. Those who own foreign bonds directly and sell their securities at a gain must separate that increase into two portions: the part that comes from market shifts and the part attributable to currency fluctuations.Why? While the part of the sale attributable to the market will be assessed as a capital gain, at a favorable tax rate, the part that is tied to currency fluctuations will be treated as ordinary income. Note that this is different from the sale of foreign equities, where the Internal Revenue Service does not require a separate accounting for market and currency fluctuations.\u201cIf you are buying and selling foreign bonds directly, you have to do that yourself,\u201d Mr. Hinkle said. \u201cBut in a mutual fund that\u2019s taken care of for you.\u201dFrancis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group, said that the various risks and tax inconveniences associated with seeking out higher-yielding alternatives were good reasons for investors to simplify their approach. Instead of reaching for yield, he suggested taking \u201ca total return perspective.\u201d In other words, rather than thinking of dividends and bond yields as separate sources of wealth, and the capital gains in an investment portfolio as another separate source, just worry about the combined total return of all of these sources. If, for instance, a portfolio yields less than expected this year but grows in value because of a rising market, nothing is wrong with taking some profits from the capital gains and leaving the income strategy alone.He counseled investors to settle on an asset allocation approach that suits them and then, if income needs arise, to be willing to sell part of their diversified portfolio. This can be done in a tax-efficient manner, he said, by selling shares of losing securities to avoid capital gains.Another benefit of this approach has nothing to do with taxes.\u201cWhat most people don\u2019t understand is that most of these high-yielding assets \u2014 M.L.P.s, REITs, high-yielding debt \u2014 are correlated much more closely to the equity markets than are traditional bonds,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said.Over the last six years, that has been fine for investors because stocks have been rising. But if equities have a protracted decline, he said, taxes are likely to be the least of the worries of investors who are reaching for yield.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe the Young Shouldn\u2019t Dive Into Stocks", "Date": "2015-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthYoung people are almost always encouraged to load up on stocks in their retirement portfolios. The prospect of returns higher than bonds over the long run in exchange for greater short-term price swings is considered a deal too good to pass up for someone with money that will remain untouched for many years.Some financial advisers have begun to question that conventional wisdom. They wonder how benign the volatility is at a time when job security is low, especially for the young, and whether retirement assets really are out of reach to them.Mr. Arnott concluded that being invested heavily in stocks when you\u2019re young was unacceptably risky. He warned that because younger savers lost or changed jobs often and had a propensity for taking money from their retirement accounts, they could lose in multiple ways: by paying tax on what they withdrew. and a 10 percent penalty, by making their withdrawals during hard times, when stock prices tended to be weak and by not being on the job long enough to be vested in the matching contributions that employers often made to retirement accounts.\u201cThe thesis that young people have 40 years until they retire and so they should invest mostly in stocks makes intuitive sense, but it\u2019s wrongheaded,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are lots of reasons not to go down that path.\u201dYet that is the path that managers of target-date funds set out on. These funds, often the default option in 401(k) plans, hold a blend of stocks and bonds in which the proportion gradually shifts over a career from almost 100 percent stocks to almost 100 percent bonds.Mr. Arnott advises young retirement savers to keep a more balanced mix of assets \u2014 say a 40/40/20 split among stocks, bonds and cash \u2014 until the portfolio is roughly worth their annual take-home pay. That way, they are less likely to lock in a steep loss if they need to tap into it during hard times.Once they reach their years of peak earnings and more job security, he said, they can increase their exposure to stocks and stay heavily invested in them until well into their 50s. Many advisers suggest that investors throttle back into bonds as retirement looms, but he contends that longer life spans almost require capturing the higher returns usually available from stocks for longer.Financial advisers find merit in Mr. Arnott\u2019s argument, but propose different solutions. Retirement contributions could wait until other goals were met. \u201cWe encourage young clients to have a three-to-six-month emergency fund outside of a retirement account where they can access the money without penalty,\u201d said Don Wilson, chief investment officer of Brightworth, an Atlanta financial planning firm. Once that\u2019s out of the way, he recommends that young savers keep 65 percent of retirement money in global stocks, 10 percent in bonds and the rest in asset-allocation funds in which the managers invest based on market conditions.Brett Bartman, an adviser at RBC Wealth Management, would go a bit further with the emergency fund, accumulating enough to get by for six to 12 months, so that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t have to touch that 401(k) money to live on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be a complete last resort.\u201dBut he wouldn\u2019t eliminate retirement contributions or saving for other worthy goals while building up the emergency fund. It would be a wasted opportunity, he said, not to pay into a workplace account up to the level that attracts employer matching contributions.\u201cDon\u2019t go all or nothing, especially if the employer is matching,\u201d Mr. Bartman said.David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, agrees that \u201cthe existence of matching contributions complicates things.\u201d A match of 50 cents on each dollar contributed \u201cis free money where you earn a 50 percent return,\u201d he said.While that should be a priority, he would limit retirement contributions in order to pay down credit card balances or other debt that carries high interest rates. Echoing Mr. Arnott, he added that any retirement money that may have to be withdrawn early should not be kept in stocks.Mr. Wilson said how young people should invest was also a matter of psychology, not just financial considerations. \u201cWe assume that younger investors should have a higher allocation to stocks because they have decades until they need the money, but you have to take into account an individual\u2019s risk tolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may not need the money for decades, but if they\u2019re going to panic in a downturn, you\u2019re not serving them well giving them a high stock recommendation.\u201dAttitudes toward risk and investing in general can be formed early, another reason Mr. Arnott finds heavy stock allocations unwise for young retirement savers. It\u2019s not just that they may have to cash out at an unfortunate moment, but that such an event may discourage them from going back in again.\u201cExperiences in our 20s shape our attitudes for life,\u201d he said. Young investors today \u201care much more risk-averse than baby boomers because their early investment experiences are very disappointing. That leaves them with lifelong risk aversion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Second-Guessing the Global Economic Funk ", "Date": "2015-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthIf global financial markets are telling a story, it\u2019s one set in a dystopia where chronic malaise keeps the economy on the verge of recession and companies can\u2019t raise prices because people can\u2019t afford to pay more.One sign of the grim outlook is the collapse in oil prices to about $45 a barrel, close to a six-year low, from $108 last June. Other commodities \u2014 including copper, corn, iron ore, platinum and soybeans \u2014 are all trading near multiyear lows, too.\u201cI thought coming into the year that 2015 would provide an opportunity to pick up assets priced for a deflationary abyss,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need inflation,\u201d he added. \u201cYou just need to avoid the abyss.\u201dIf the abyss is avoided, a variety of means exist to capitalize on that, including energy stocks, junk bonds and stocks in emerging markets, Mr. Paulsen said. A rebound in growth probably would increase demand for oil, and junk bonds would tend to rally as investors express relief that issuers are likely to have sufficient business to meet interest payments. A robust global economy helps emerging markets in several ways, by supporting their bonds and currencies, and expanding markets for companies that export commodities and other goods to the West.John C. Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity fund, agreed, saying that \u201cif you really thought there was going to be global growth and healthy inflation, emerging markets would be an interesting place to go.\u201dThe same applies to other economically sensitive niches that have been shunned for several years, he said, including shares of mining companies, home builders and producers of building materials. He especially likes copper-mining stocks because in his view supply and demand are more closely balanced for copper than for other industrial metals, so he expects copper producers to respond more favorably to a rebound in growth.Mr. Maxwell is more skeptical about prospects for big oil companies. These days, he remarked, \u201ca lot more people are experts on the oil price after nobody got it right.\u201dTo Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, a re-evaluation of deflationary expectations would make prospects particularly bright for Mexican stocks. Mexico\u2019s proximity to the United States has made its economy more resilient than those of other oil exporters, she pointed out, so it\u2019s also a comparatively safe option.\u201cOne reason I think it\u2019s an interesting time for Mexico is that its economic fundamentals are decent, with a small deficit and growth closest to trend,\u201d she said, meaning the average rate across an economic cycle. She finds Mexico a good investment destination \u201cif you think the U.S. might do O.K. this year and oil won\u2019t go to zero.\u201dThe same goes for Canada, she said. While far more mature economically than Mexico and other developing countries, Canada is a large energy exporter, and its economic output and currency have been hurt by the drop in oil prices, she noted.Bonds in economically fragile Mediterranean countries like Spain and Italy should benefit from ebbing deflation fears, but loose European Central Bank policies have kept yields close to record lows, just like those of more stable economies. A weaker euro, which reduces the dollar value of European bonds and their income, means that American buyers face currency risk, too, so Ms. Patterson recommends avoiding them.\u201cI would stay far away from Spanish or Italian government bonds,\u201d she warned. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for pain. I don\u2019t see any benefit for dollar-based investors\u2019 owning European debt.\u201dDavid B. Iben, manager of the Kopernik fund, said he found \u201cno evidence of deflation whatsoever\u201d and saw plenty of room to run for exotic commodity plays.\u201cWe\u2019re finding incredible values in uranium, farmland, coal and electricity generation outside the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market used to make you pay up for those, but they\u2019re trading at prices that should make them work out whether we get inflation or deflation.\u201dHe also likes South American farmland owners, such as SLC Agricola in Brazil and Cresud in Argentina, and electricity producers like Eletrobras in Brazil and RusHydro in Russia. Shares of all four trade in the United States.Mr. Maxwell at Ivy said he was wary of buying stocks in Russia, where energy played a dominant role in the economy. Because of the geopolitical risk, he said, \u201cI would not be going crazy and buying Russia.\u201dNeither would Mr. Paulsen of Wells. He would avoid esoteric investments like those Mr. Iben suggested and stick with more sedate choices in case the global economy turned out to be more like the horror story that some feared and not a rags-to-riches tale.\u201cThere are plays that will do well if the trend reverses without having to go into deep, deep plays like Russia,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cI like the idea of betting against deflation, but when there are so many bargains around, you can take a conservative approach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Stimulus Plan Sends Some Investments Reeling", "Date": "2015-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank\u2019s plan to begin a big monetary stimulus program next month is already causing money to contort in new and sometimes strange ways.German bonds maturing in seven years traded at a negative interest rate for the first time on Thursday, meaning investors are willing to temporarily lose money for the privilege of owning the bonds. And the German insurance giant Allianz, which traditionally invests mainly in bonds and other securities, announced on Thursday that it would invest billions of euros more in property, adding to a portfolio that includes a British military garrison and a French shopping mall.Both developments reflected attempts by investors to cope with the latest effects of European Central Bank monetary policy, which could help the eurozone economy but has already created problems for insurance companies and others obligated to put their money in ultra-safe assets.Government bonds have traditionally been the asset of choice for risk-shy investors. But the central bank\u2019s plans to begin buying government bonds and other debt, at the pace of 60 billion euros, or $67.8 billion, a month, have pushed rates on bonds from Germany, Finland and some other countries into negative territory.Simply put, the same fears that are prompting the central bank to act \u2014 the threat of deflation, in which wages and prices actually fall for a protracted period \u2014 are prompting bond investors to behave as if investments could be worth less in the future than they are now.But for investors seeking to earn a return, there is little appeal in bonds that are worth less when they mature than when purchased.\u201cNegative yields are for me a typical sign of bubble mania,\u201d Maximilian Zimmerer, the chief investment officer of Allianz, said by telephone on Thursday.So beginning several years ago, when interest rates began their slide, the company began looking for alternatives. Among other things, Allianz, based in Munich, invested in wind parks; a shopping mall in Nice, France; and a military garrison in Colchester, England, which it owns and operates for the British Ministry of Defense. Allianz said on Thursday that it would aim to increase its alternative portfolio to \u20ac110 billion, up from \u20ac74 billion at the end of 2014.\u201cI would like to do even more,\u201d Mr. Zimmerer said, but noted that the company was limited by regulations. Allianz, in announcing its quarterly results on Thursday, also said that Pimco, the big bond-specialist investment firm it owns, had seen money leaving in recent months.Prodding companies like Allianz to seek out new investments may be just what Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, intended. By scooping up many of the safe assets, the central bank aims to force investors out of their comfort zones and get them to spend money in countries that need it, like Spain and Italy.Stocks markets are already rallying in anticipation of the central bank bond buying, a form of money printing known as quantitative easing that is aimed at arresting the recent slide in inflation to levels considered unhealthy for growth. Corporations are taking advantage of the low interest rates to raise money for investment. In another encouraging sign, the European Central Bank published data on Thursday showing that lending is beginning to recover in the eurozone.\u201cIf there\u2019s little expected return in government bonds, then investors will look for better ideas,\u201d said Richard Dunbar, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s an explicit part of the policy of quantitative easing to get investors to move toward riskier assets, and it appears to be working.\u201dSimilar quantitative easing by central banks seems to have helped economic growth in the United States and Britain, although their programs did not result in negative interest rates \u2014 in part, because those economies were not as chronically listless as the eurozone\u2019s when those stimulus programs began.But Mr. Dunbar said it remained to be seen what would happen in Europe. \u201cThis is a massive monetary experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might have unintended consequences, and we watch that carefully.\u201dMarket interest rates on bonds have been falling to unheard-of levels in anticipation of the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying program. On Thursday the yield on German seven-year bonds fell just below zero. A day earlier, the German government sold five-year bonds at a negative rate \u2014 minus 0.08 percent \u2014 for the first time.Why would any sane person buy a bond that will have a lower face value in seven years than it does today? In some cases, the investors are desperate for a safe place to put their money. Others may believe that the eurozone is on the verge of deflation, a broad decline in prices. If consumer prices are falling at a rate of 0.6 percent, as they did in January, a bond with a negative rate of 0.08 percent may still be profitable.Still, the negative rates make many market watchers nervous. If inflation rises again, as the European Central Bank hopes, some investors may suffer big losses.\u201cThe level of negative interest rates is something only capital markets can invent and justify,\u201d said Hugues Le Maire, co-founder of Diamant Bleu Gestion, an investment firm in Paris. \u201cYou would not see that in real life.\u201dMr. Le Maire, though, is among the investors who are reveling in the effects of central bank policy. He has been investing in eurozone bank stocks, he said, because they have been the direct beneficiaries of European Central Bank policy, including access to cash at interest rates close to zero.If European Central Bank policy has the intended effect, inflation will rise again and so will interest rates. The eurozone economy will grow faster, and everyone will benefit, including insurance companies.\u201cThe E.C.B. is moving forward with energy and commitment,\u201d said Pierre Guillemin, head of portfolio management at Swiss Life Asset Managers. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good sign.\u201dBut if the central bank\u2019s policy fails, there may be consequences in a region where the percentage of retired people is rising fast. State and private pensions will have problems earning the returns they need to finance retirement benefits.\u201cThat\u2019s the real message about this very low interest rate environment,\u201d said Mr. Guillemin, speaking from Paris. \u201cThe danger is not that it lasts for weeks, but that it lasts for years.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave a wrong currency conversion for the amount of asset purchases the European Central Bank plans to buy each month, which is 60 billion euros. The equivalent dollar amount is $67.8 billion, not $92 billion.Advertisement"}

Spy being Spy, it was a grand feast of love-hate celebration: \u201cA Return to the Decade of Mood Rings, Ultrasuede, Sideburns and Disco Sex-Machine Tony Orlando.\u201d One of its implicit premises was the silliness of the pandemic of American nostalgia, especially for a culturally dubious decade that had ended less than a decade earlier. Over the last half century, we Americans have come to create and consume automatically and continuously a kind of recent-past wistfulness.This isn\u2019t (mainly) fogeyishness on my part. No. It is empirically, objectively, broadly true. I am not now nor have I ever been a Clintonite, but when Jeb Bush reportedly said a few weeks ago, apropos of 2016 and the probable Democratic presidential nominee, that \u201cif someone wants to run a campaign about \u201990s nostalgia, it\u2019s not going to be very successful,\u201d I think he was being wishful.From 1990 to 1999, the median American household income grew by 10 percent; since 2000 it\u2019s shrunk by nearly 9 percent.

And so on.By the end of the decade, in fact, there was so much good news \u2014 a federal budget surplus, dramatic reductions in violent crime (the murder rate in the United States declined by 41 percent) and in deaths from H.I.V./AIDS \u2014 that each astounding new achievement didn\u2019t quite register as miraculous. After all, the decade had begun with a fantastically joyful and previously unimaginable development: The Soviet empire collapsed, global nuclear Armageddon ceased to be a thing that worried anyone very much, and the nations of Eastern Europe were mostly unchained.A tide of progress and good sense seemed to be sweeping the whole world. According to the annual count by Freedom House, the tally of the world\u2019s free countries climbed from 65 at the beginning of the decade to 85 at the end. Since then, the total number of certified-free countries has increased by only four.Between 1990 and 1994 South Africa dismantled apartheid surprisingly peacefully. With the Oslo Accords, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization had come together at last to negotiate a framework for coexistence and eventual peace. The civil wars in the former Yugoslavia ended and an enduring peace was restored. China became normal, reforming its economy, tripling its gross domestic product and easing its way into the world order. During the \u201990s, the only American-led war in the Middle East was the one that drove Saddam Hussein\u2019s invading army out of Kuwait with a ground campaign that lasted a mere 100 hours. Peace, prosperity, order \u2014 and American culture was vibrant and healthy as well. There were both shockingly excellent versions of what had come before and distinctly new, original forms. Wasn\u2019t the release of Nirvana\u2019s \u201cNevermind,\u201d in 1991, pretty much the last time a new rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band truly, deeply mattered, the way rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did in the \u201960s and \u201970s? Wasn\u2019t hip-hop, which achieved its mass-market breakthrough and dominance in the \u201990s, the last genuinely new and consequential invention of American pop culture? What is the most remarkably successful literary creation of the last several decades? The Harry Potter novels, the first three of which appeared in the \u201990s. Supertalented literary youngsters appeared \u2014 David Foster Wallace (\u201cInfinite Jest\u201d), Donna Tartt (\u201cThe Secret History\u201d), Jonathan Lethem (\u201cMotherless Brooklyn\u201d) and Dave Eggers (McSweeney\u2019s). And supertalented literary geezers \u2014 Philip Roth (\u201cAmerican Pastoral\u201d), John Updike (\u201cRabbit at Rest\u201d), Alice Munro (\u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d), Don DeLillo (\u201cUnderworld\u201d) \u2014 produced some of their best and most successful work as well.The quality of television radically improved. \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d had their premieres in 1989, and in the \u201990s they blew up, along with \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d \u2014 all of them broadcast network series, none of them reality shows. HBO, before the \u201990s a channel for movies, boxing and soft-core porn, decided to swing for the fences. First with \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d and then with \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d it proved that episodic television could accommodate major ambition and actual brilliance, ushering in an enduring new (cable) TV era.In feature films, it was the decade of \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and the indie movement, thanks to which idiosyncratic, more-commercial-than-art-house masterpieces like those by Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne and Richard Linklater became plausible. It was also the decade in which traditional Disney animation came back from the dead and in which Pixar, with the first two \u201cToy Story\u201d movies, reinvented the form magnificently.THE digital age, of course, got fully underway in the \u201990s. At the beginning of the decade almost none of us had heard of the web, and we didn\u2019t have browsers, search engines, digital cellphone networks, fully 3-D games or affordable and powerful laptops. By the end of the decade we had them all. Steve Jobs returned to Apple and conjured its rebirth.Indeed, the \u201990s were a decade of catastrophes that didn\u2019t happen. The Clinton tax increases did not trigger a recession. Welfare reform did not ravage the poor. Compared with Sandy, every hurricane that touched New York \u2014 Bob! Bertha! Danny! Dennis! Floyd! \u2014 was a dud.Were there real problems in the \u201990s? Of course. But they weren\u2019t obvious, so ... we were blissfully ignorant! Almost none of us were suitably alarmed by carbon emissions and the warming planet. According to a 1995 article in this newspaper about climate change, \u201cmost scientists say the amount of warming so far, about one degree Fahrenheit in the last century, is still too small to be distinguished from the climate system\u2019s natural fluctuations.\u201d So why worry?When the House and Senate passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and President Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, doing away with the firewalls between investment banks and commercial banks, the change seemed inevitable, sensible, modern \u2014 not a precursor of the 2008 Wall Street crash. When a jihadist truck bomb detonated in the parking garage below the north tower of the World Trade Center in 1993, we were alarmed only briefly, figuring it for a crazy one-off rather than a first strike in a long struggle.Americans have never much liked paying attention to foreign countries and their problems (see Rwanda, 1994), so the decade between the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the war on terror was very much our cup of tea.Today there are more than 13,000 Starbucks in the United States. And each of them, to my eye, looks exactly as it did when the rollout began \u2014 13,000 ubiquitous and faintly melancholic time-capsule museums of the last best American decade.

{"Headline": "Oil Prices Up 3% on News of Economic Growth in Europe, but Supplies Rise", "Date": "2015-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The global benchmark price for oil rallied above $60 a barrel on Friday for the first time in 2015, but analysts warned that growing stockpiles were hanging over the market and could easily force prices back down.On the supply side, traders have gained confidence by the announcements virtually every day of oil companies reducing their investments in exploration and production as much as 40 percent.The rig count in the United States has declined steadily since the beginning of the year to a nearly four-year low, as more executives have decided to leave oil in the ground until prices rebound.\u201cWe cannot predict nor control the length or depth of this oil price correction or the timing and extent of the rebound,\u201d John J. Christmann IV, Apache\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call, reflecting the uncertain sentiments voiced by many oil executives lately. \u201cWe have therefore acted quickly and decisively regarding the things we can control: our activity levels and cost structure.\u201dThe price of oil fell nearly 60 percent from June to late January. It began recovering somewhat in recent weeks as traders became increasingly optimistic that oil companies were quickly decommissioning rigs and cutting investments in exploration and production at a rate not seen since the oil price slump in the 1980s.Gasoline prices have been edging up for motorists. The average national price for a gallon of regular was $2.24 on Friday, 12 cents more than a month ago. But consumers are stilling paying nearly $1.10 less a gallon than a year ago.The question remains whether the cuts producers are making will be enough to bring supplies into balance with demand; the global market has an excess of 1.5 million to two million barrels a day. That oil has been flooding into storage tanks in Cushing, Okla., around the Gulf of Mexico and on tankers around the world.The inventory of crude stocks in the United States alone reached a record this week of 413 million barrels, according to a report released on Friday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. And with onshore storage filling quickly, the bank estimated that by summer, 50 million to 100 million more barrels could be in floating storage on supertankers.At some point, unless global demand for oil suddenly picks up, producers will have no place to put their oil \u2014 forcing them to lower their prices and eventually stop producing.\u201cIn our view, global inventory dynamics could continue to deteriorate in coming weeks, leading to renewed selling pressure in the oil markets,\u201d the Bank of America Merrill Lynch report concluded.But analysts are divided over when the storage tanks in the United States will be filled. Some say maximum storage capacity will not be reached until the middle of summer, depending on how much consumers take advantage of declining gasoline prices to drive long distances on their spring and summer vacations.Oil production from new American wells fell to 525,000 barrels a day in January from 600,000 in May, according to a report by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Policy Study released this week. Still, overall production in the United States continued to increase, and government and energy experts estimate that it will take at least until the second half of the year for the growth in production to stop.The Energy Department noted this week that American crude oil production was 9.2 million barrels a day in January and estimated that it would average 9.3 million barrels a day for the year. That is a steep decline in growth from the last three years, when average daily production rose at least a million barrels each year.Brent crude settled on Friday at $61.52 a barrel, up $2.24, in London, and the American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, at $52.78, up $1.37, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The study created a series of stock indexes, compared their returns and found that funds without energy-sector stocks underperformed those with them \u2014 by as much as 0.7 percent, according to the analysis. Adding in transaction costs and reduced diversification, \u201cthe costs to investors of fossil fuel divestiture are highly likely and substantial, while the potential benefits \u2014 to the extent there are any \u2014 are ill-defined and uncertain at best,\u201d wrote the lead author of the study, Daniel R.

Also, institutions that decide to divest generally acknowledge that their actions have more to do with moral considerations than economic ones.

{"Headline": "Japan Makes a Quick Exit From Its Latest Recession", "Date": "2015-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s latest recession was as short as it was unexpected.The Japanese economy, the world\u2019s third-largest, started expanding again at the end of 2014, government data showed Monday, after a painful midyear slump that had raised doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s efforts to rekindle growth and end entrenched deflation.The latest in what seem like countless Japanese downturns \u2014 there have been six since 1997 \u2014 lasted just two quarters, the shortest technical definition of a recession. Yet the return to growth was more tepid than experts had predicted and may fail to erase concerns that the economy remains fundamentally fragile, despite Mr. Abe\u2019s two-year stimulus campaign.\u201cThe economy has escaped the worst phase and is recovering, but the pace is likely to remain extremely slow,\u201d said Yasunari Ueno, an economist at Mizuho Securities, a Japanese brokerage firm.In the preliminary report, the Cabinet Office said gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 2.2 percent in the quarter through December. Economists surveyed by news agencies had been more optimistic, forecasting an expansion of 3.7 percent, on average.Since he returned to power at the end of 2012, Mr. Abe has been trying to inject life into the economy through a set of pro-growth policies known as Abenomics. Much of the work has been carried out by the Bank of Japan, the central bank, which is creating money on a vast scale by buying government bonds and other assets.The economy did not grow at all in 2014, according to the Monday report, with two quarters of recession \u2014 widely attributed to an ill-timed increase in the national sales tax \u2014 almost exactly canceling out two quarters of expansion. Growth in the two years since Mr. Abe began his campaign has added up to a modest 1.6 percent, slightly less than the 1.8 rate recorded in 2012, the year before he took office.Economists say 2015 could be a more forgiving year for his program of reforms. Mr. Abe has postponed a second increase in the sales tax, which had been planned for October, hoping to avoid a fresh blow to consumer confidence. And a weaker yen has begun to spur domestic manufacturing by increasing demand for exports from Japan.Tourism, too, is booming, as once-prohibitively expensive Japanese cities start to look cheap to travelers from countries with stronger currencies.\u201cConsumer confidence appears to be improving, and looking ahead I think we can be hopeful,\u201d the economics minister, Akira Amari, said at a news conference after the economic growth report.Cheaper oil is also working in Japan\u2019s favor, with one drawback. The slide in oil prices since the middle of last year has lowered costs for households and businesses in an economy that largely depends on imported energy. But it is threatening another goal of Abenomics: that of keeping consumer prices rising modestly, instead of falling, as they have done for much of the last two decades.The trade-off worries officials at the Bank of Japan, because a slide back toward deflation would bring pressure to expand even further the scale of the bank\u2019s bond-buying program. At 80 trillion yen a year, or close to $700 billion, it is already uncomfortably large for some on the bank\u2019s policy board. Yet letting prices fall again could have even worse consequences for the economy.The bank\u2019s measures are keeping borrowing costs extremely low \u2014 an invitation for more spending and investment. They are also holding down the yen\u2019s exchange rate, which helps big manufacturing companies like Toyota and Hitachi that sell large quantities of their products in foreign markets. The stock market is up, and corporate profits are at record highs.On Monday, the Nikkei 225-share average rose 0.51 percent after the growth report, which was released just before trading began, while the yen fell slightly against the dollar.Given the support provided by Abenomics, Japan\u2019s slide into recession last year was a surprise and a worry. The long-planned increase in the sales tax, carried out in April, hit consumers harder than the government and most economists had expected, calling the effectiveness of Mr. Abe\u2019s stimulus policies into question. Wages are still falling, adjusted for inflation, and many workers feel left out.Consumer spending and business investment grew fractionally in the quarter to December, Monday\u2019s report showed, while exports increased at their fastest pace since early 2014. But housing investment continued a decline that began after the tax increase in April.Many economists are forecasting that growth will settle into a slow but still positive trend, expanding perhaps 1.5 or 2 percent this year and next.\u201cGoing forward, we expect the Japanese economy to trace a moderate recovery path,\u201d said Naohiko Baba, the chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs.Where, precisely, that path leads could be determined by the result of annual wage negotiations between unions and large corporations, known as shunto \u2014 \u201cspring battle\u201d \u2014 which reach their peak in March. Mr. Abe has been pressing business leaders to divert more of their ever-increasing cash reserves back into the economy by investing and raising workers\u2019 pay.By doing so, the prime minister may hope to reverse a growing perception that Abenomics is widening the wealth gap in a society that has long regarded itself as egalitarian. Mr. Abe\u2019s policies have helped lift the prices of assets like stocks and property, owned disproportionately by the well-off. He also wants to lower regulatory barriers and loosen legal protections on job security \u2014 measures that supporters say will make Japan more competitive but which make many workers nervous.Competing visions for Japan\u2019s economic future were on display in Parliament on Monday in an exchange between Mr. Abe and Katsuya Okada, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. \u201cI want to do my utmost to move toward a society where effort is rewarded,\u201d Mr. Abe said when challenged by Mr. Okada about the effects of Abenomics on equality.Mr. Okada replied: \u201cThe biggest problem with the government\u2019s economic policies is that there is no consideration of how the fruits of growth will be distributed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Irving Kahn, Oldest Active Wall Street Investor, Dies at 109", "Date": "2015-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIrving Kahn, who made his first stock trade in June 1929 \u2014 turning a tidy profit from the stock market crash four months later \u2014 and persevered for more than eight decades to become Wall Street\u2019s oldest living active professional investor, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 109.His son Thomas confirmed his death.A disciple and later partner of Benjamin Graham, the contrarian advocate of \u201cvalue investing,\u201d Mr. Kahn would go on to work at Abraham & Company and Lehman Brothers, which he left in 1978 to open Kahn Brothers Group with two of his sons, Alan and Thomas. When he died, he was chairman of Kahn Brothers, a privately owned investment advisory and brokerage firm, which manages $1 billion through its subsidiaries.He was also the last surviving member of what had been described as the oldest living sibling quartet. One sister, Lee, died in 2005 at the age of 101. Another sister, Helen Reichert, was seven weeks shy of her 110th birthday when she died in 2011. Their younger brother, Peter Keane, died last year after turning 103.Until late last year, Mr. Kahn was still commuting by taxi to his Midtown office from his Upper East Side apartment three days a week.Irving Kahn was born in Manhattan on Dec. 19, 1905 (the stock market rebounded that day), to Mamie Friedman and Saul Kahn. His father sold light fixtures.Mr. Graham recruited Mr. Kahn to be a part-time teaching assistant at Columbia Business School, where Mr. Graham taught after trading hours. His acolytes included Warren Buffett. Both Mr. Kahn and Mr. Buffett were so taken with him that they bestowed the middle name Graham on their sons.At Columbia, Mr. Kahn also met Ruth Perl, who was studying for her doctorate in psychology. They married in 1931. She died in 1996. Beside his sons Thomas and Alan, he is survived by seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.In reviewing a biography of Mr. Graham, The Economist magazine wrote in 2012 that he had \u201cdeveloped the concept of a \u2018margin of safety,\u2019\u00a0\u201d urging investors \u201cto buy shares well below the company\u2019s intrinsic value.\u201dAlready steeped in that concept, Mr. Kahn expected a market downturn in 1929 because traders were bidding stock prices into the stratosphere.He sold short 50 shares of red-hot Magma Copper that June, wagering that the price would plummet. When the market crashed on Oct. 29, his $300 investment, about $4,000 in today\u2019s dollars, more than doubled.\u201cI wasn\u2019t smart,\u201d Mr. Kahn recalled in a 2006 interview with National Public Radio, \u201cbut even a dumb young kid could see these guys were gambling. They were all borrowing money and having a good time and being right for a few months and, after that, you know what happened.\u201dAfter the 2008 financial crisis, he endorsed a division between banks that accept deposits and those that use their own money to trade securities.Mr. Kahn meticulously studied a company\u2019s performance, measuring its potential return not by the quarter but over four or five years. In 2012, though, he told Bloomberg Businessweek that while Mr. Graham\u2019s principles still applied, they were often overlooked in today\u2019s babble.\u201cSo many people watch financial TV at bars, in the barber shop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis superfluity of information, all this static in the air.\u201dMr. Kahn continued to devour newspapers and magazines until a few hours before he died. His grandson Andrew, a research analyst at his grandfather\u2019s firm, had been reading an Economist cover article to him on Vladimir Putin.\u201cMy father smoked until he was 50, and he didn\u2019t watch what he ate,\u201d Thomas Kahn said. \u201cSo the preponderance of his case was DNA and luck.\u201dHe said he received an email from Dr. Barzilai the other day suggesting that his father will remain forever young. \u201cIrving\u2019s not dead,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbecause we have his cells and his DNA, and they\u2019re working every day in our laboratory.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about Irving Kahn, Wall Street\u2019s oldest living active professional investor, referred incorrectly to the location of DeWitt Clinton High School, which Mr. Kahn attended. At the time, it was in Manhattan \u2014 not the Bronx, where it relocated in 1929.Advertisement"}

Oil prices plummeted further in January, raising the likelihood that earnings for Exxon and other oil companies would deteriorate more in the current first quarter. Oil prices have surged more than 10 percent in recent days, but most experts doubt they will recover in a sustainable way until the second half of the year, at the earliest.\u201cUnless oil prices recover meaningfully this year, energy stocks, including Exxon, are expensive despite the correction in the last six months,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.Exxon tried to put a positive face on the results. It reported positive results from its drilling in Argentina, as well as an expansion of its development plans in West Africa and off the North Atlantic coast of Canada. But Exxon has also suffered from the continuing crisis in Ukraine and western sanctions on Russia, forcing the company to suspend work with the Russian company Rosneft on exploration in the Arctic.\u201cExxon Mobil\u2019s results illustrate the value of our proven business model that integrates upstream, downstream and chemical businesses,\u201d Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cOur balanced portfolio uniquely positions Exxon Mobil to deliver superior results throughout the commodity price cycle.\u201dFourth-quarter earnings from upstream production were $5.5 billion, down $1.3 billion from the previous year. Its earnings from United States production operations far exceeded those abroad, with American production earnings up $317 million for the quarter compared with those overseas, which were down $1.6 billion from the previous year.On the positive side, the company reported that its chemical business earnings were $1.2 billion, $317 million higher than the year before, in large part because of lower natural gas prices that serve as a feedstock.The company noted that most of its reduction in oil production came from the expiration of a concession in Abu Dhabi.videoAdvertisement"}

But the union is far from complete, especially in the financial sector.A well-regulated capital markets union would take years to create but could provide a boost to the struggling European economy by reducing the cost of borrowing money, especially for small and medium-size businesses, and providing savers with greater investment opportunities. Combining Europe\u2019s stock and bond markets would also reduce the reliance on banks, many of which have not yet recovered from bad investments and loans made before the financial crisis. To realize these benefits and to protect against another crisis, European officials should create new regulatory agencies, or use existing ones, to issue and enforce strong financial rules in coordination with national agencies. They will have to guard against efforts by special interests to use the creation of a capital markets union to roll back sensible European and national regulations that were put in place in response to the global financial crisis. They should also create a common approach to resolving defaults and bankruptcies, so borrowers and lenders have confidence that they will be treated the same regardless of where they are based. In recent years, European leaders have done too little to make the union stronger. The misguided demands by officials in Germany and on the European Commission for austerity in Greece, Spain, Ireland and other economically troubled eurozone countries has contributed to high unemployment in those nations. It is little wonder that many Europeans are losing faith in the E.U.

{"Headline": "You Too Can Be a Global Real Estate Investor", "Date": "2015-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthWith the 2008 collapse still visible in many investors\u2019 rearview mirrors, it is often hard to make a case for real estate. After all, the rebound of high-end Manhattan properties aside, didn\u2019t a crash caused by a credit bubble taint the idea of broader real estate investing?But it still makes sense to own properties through real estate investment trusts, called REITs, and exchange-traded funds.Part of the reason REITs have performed consistently is that under United States law they must pay out at least 90 percent of their earnings to shareholders. That cash comes from rents paid by property owners. Yields on REITs that hold properties and mortgages averaged 4 percent last year, double the S.&P. 500\u2019s dividend yield.While REITs can certainly be as volatile as stocks, in growing economies they can raise rents, which can offset their sensitivity to rising interest rates.Nevertheless, global economic health is worth watching because Brazil, Japan and most of Europe are reporting meager growth and China\u2019s growth appears to be slowing. In addition to their income bonus, REITs offer diversification from common stocks and bonds. Although they are traded on stock exchanges, these vehicles, owning mostly commercial real estate, rarely follow stocks closely.But one of the strongest arguments for holding global real estate trusts in the near future is their resilience in an environment of rising interest rates, which many pundits predict is coming. A study last year by Altegris, an alternative investment firm, said the conventional wisdom that REITs would get burned if interest rates rise, as investors turn to vehicles with higher yields, was only partly true.The firm studied REIT returns since 1972 and found that in seven periods of rising interest rates, REITs declined in only two and rose in five. \u201cThe initial reaction to rising rates and REITs is negative,\u201d said Neena Mishra, director of exchange-traded fund research for Zacks Investment Research, \u201cbut long term they can withstand the reaction.\u201dMs. Mishra recommends broad-based exchange-traded funds that invest in a variety of REITs. Among her picks are the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), which holds 143 companies, and the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR), which similarly holds companies investing in apartments and hotels, as well as industrial, office, public storage and retail properties. The SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF (RWX) invests in companies outside the United States. Robert Stammers, director of investor education for the CFA Institute and a former real estate fund manager, said if investors thought they had invested enough in real estate by owning primary and secondary homes, \u201cthe correlation of commercial real estate with residential is low.\u201cREITs definitely have a role in portfolios,\u201d Mr. Stammers added. \u201cThey can provide a good inflation hedge and can perform well in the face of rising interest rates. Although performance as an inflation hedge or in the face of rising rates is not absolute, they are both good reasons to include REITs in an investment portfolio.\u201dThe downside of REITs is that they can go south in a widespread downturn in the global economy, as was the case in 2008. The NAREIT Composite Index fell nearly 38 percent that year in total return. That was roughly equivalent to the loss of the benchmark S.&P. 500-stock index. Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner in Milwaukee, who called commercial real estate an \u201calternative\u201d investment, recommends a small, steady exposure to REITs in the stock portion of a portfolio. Just keep in mind that, even though they pay generous dividends, REITs should not be considered as safe as bonds; they will still take a hit if interest rates climb because they will be competing with bond yields. \u201cThey move like a stock in volatility,\u201d Ms. Hogan noted. Investing in commercial real estate through individual REITs can be difficult, though, if investors are trying to time various markets. It may be wise to get professional advice and to think long term if investing for a retirement portfolio. And investors who choose REITs should keep in mind they will incur some tax obligations if held outside retirement plans. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Moves to Free Up Money in Its Economy", "Date": "2015-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China signaled fresh concerns about its slowing economy as the country\u2019s central bank moved on Wednesday to stimulate growth by freeing up more money for banks to lend. The action reflects the growing uncertainty in the global economy. Central banks around the world are grappling with how to respond to falling oil prices, low inflation, volatile currencies and tepid demand. In recent weeks, India, Australia, Singapore, Canada and Denmark have all turned to monetary tools to address weaknesses in their economies. The European Central Bank last month unleashed a major stimulus program aimed at stoking a return to moderate inflation and rekindling growth. China is dealing with a slowdown, as its economy last year grew 7.4 percent, its lowest rate since 1990. Real estate and heavy industry, like steel production, have been the biggest brakes on the country\u2019s growth. Real estate prices have been gradually falling since last spring, and while the pace of the decline has begun to slow, construction has lost momentum. That has contributed to a sharp drop in steel prices in China in the last several weeks. While the drop to some extent reflected the halving of iron ore prices last year, the price decline was also a warning sign of very weak demand.Taking aim at such worries, the People\u2019s Bank of China on Wednesday reduced the share of assets that commercial banks must hold as reserves. Doing so gives institutions more leeway for lending, which is particularly beneficial to real estate and industry. Home buyers, for example, consider the availability of mortgages and the interest rate on them before deciding whether to make a purchase. Developers have borrowed heavily as well, and need to be able to keep obtaining new loans to repay previous loans.Steelmaking and auto manufacturing require large initial investments, typically financed with borrowed money. Plus, buyers of steel and cars frequently need bank loans for purchases.The Chinese central bank reduced its required reserve ratio by half a percentage point. The ratio varies by financial institutions, but for big commercial banks this means a reduction to 19.5 percent, from 20 percent.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy maintained to an appropriate degree, guide monetary credit and social financing to steady moderate growth, and promote the smooth operation of economic health,\u201d the bank said in a statement announcing its decision.But the policies could create other challenges for the country. An increase in lending could further drive a stock market rally that has been propelled mainly by small investors who have borrowed money to buy stocks. Regulators have already tried to reduce the risk of a bubble popping by tightening some limits on such margin trading.The central bank\u2019s move could also fuel China\u2019s propensity for credit-driven growth. Easy lending policies by state-controlled banks, particularly as China sought to avoid the effects of the global financial crisis, have left a long list of industries bedeviled by severe overcapacity, falling prices and little or no profit \u2014 and scant ability to repay bank loans. Fearing that additional lending could result in even more nonperforming loans, the central bank has periodically tried to signal tighter monetary policies, only to face overwhelming pressure from other government agencies for easier credit to prevent the economy from slowing further.Reducing the reserve ratio means that banks will be allowed to park less money at the central bank, where it earns negligible interest, and will lend it instead. The greater availability of loans is likely to push down interest rates, which in turn will make it less attractive to invest in China\u2019s currency, the renminbi.That could result in further weakening of the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods even more competitive in foreign markets, while making imports more expensive in China. In the United States, many Democrats and some Republicans in Congress have called over the years for China to be confronted on what they describe as the deliberate undervaluation of the renminbi to help Chinese exports.Economists at Standard Chartered predicted in a research note Wednesday evening that the renminbi would not decline immediately, because some investors would hold it in the hope that the central bank\u2019s action would help pick up the tempo of economic growth. But with the dollar strong, and the central bank limiting its intervention in those markets, the renminbi could later weaken, the economists said.Economists at UBS pointed out in a research note Wednesday night that the central bank to some extent needed to reduce the reserve ratio to offset the investment money now flowing out of China.An estimated $160 billion left the country in the fourth quarter alone, more than in the previous three quarters combined. Faced with slowing growth at home, wealthy Chinese have been investing more of their money offshore, particularly seeking to profit from the strengthening American economy and dollar. That has reversed the pattern of most of the last decade, when investors were trying to put more money into China. When the money was previously flooding into China, the central bank used to issue hundreds of billions of extra renminbi annually to buy dollars. Foreign exchange reserves peaked at $3.99 trillion last June, before edging down to $3.84 trillion by December as the tide of capital began to flow in the other direction.With the central bank no longer issuing such a torrent of renminbi, credit has tightened somewhat. The lowering of the required reserve ratio, UBS said, is needed to offset that pullback.For mostly small banks that lend heavily to small businesses, certain water conservation projects and farmers, the central bank cut the requirement by an additional half-point. The reserve ratio was cut by an extra 4 percentage points for the Agricultural Development Bank of China, an arm of the central bank whose mission is to help rural areas.The change is set to take effect on Thursday, allowing time for commercial banks to supply extra money to the economy before the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts two weeks later.The days leading up to the Lunar New Year celebrations are often characterized by heavy spending on parties and gifts. The central bank commonly injects extra money into the financial system to accommodate this \u2014 although it usually chooses less drastic measures to do so, like short-term loans to commercial banks.\u201cLiquidity typically tightens ahead of Chinese New Year, which may explain the timing of this decision,\u201d wrote Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist in the London office of Capital Economics, a research firm.

{"Headline": "The Logic of an Empty $100 Million Pad ", "Date": "2015-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Section: WealthFor most investors, a diversified portfolio means a prudent mix of stocks and bonds. For the global elite, diversification increasingly means splurging on New York apartments that can cost tens of millions of dollars, or more. Across Manhattan, real estate developers are scrambling to meet surging demand from buyers around the world who are prepared to pay record-setting prices for new developments with opulent finishes and extraordinary views. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a global piggy bank,\u201d said Kirk Henckels, vice chairman of Stribling & Associates. Yet at the upper echelons of the property market, the lines between prudent investing and splashy one-upmanship are inherently blurred. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about a bank account that big, diversification is a basic rule of economics and investment,\u201d Mr. Henckels said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way to justify investing in your toys.\u201dHead-scratching prices aside, New York real estate has proved to be a durable, even lucrative long-term investment. Residential property in Manhattan appreciated 26 percent over the last five years, according to data from the Corcoran Group. That\u2019s not bad. But compared to stocks, which have rebounded sharply since the financial crisis, it is subpar. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up more than 75 percent over the same period. Among certain New York properties, though, the appreciation was more striking. New development, which accounts for many of the priciest sales in the city, is up 52 percent over the last five years, Corcoran says. And at the highest end of the market, returns outperformed almost all other asset classes. In 2013, properties that changed hands for more than $9.5 million gave their sellers an average 32 percent profit, according to StreetEasy. \u201cWhen you study the values of New York real estate, whether it\u2019s five or 10 or 20 years, the story says buy,\u201d said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group.A major factor feeding the sudden buying binge is a flood of new properties that cater to the top tier of global buyers. Half a dozen residential skyscrapers are sprouting in Midtown Manhattan, each promising views, amenities and materials fit for kings and queens. One57, the first completed, has sold most of its units, including the city\u2019s first $100 million apartment. Further east, the gridlike facade of 432 Park Avenue already looms over Midtown, its perfectly square windows making it the city\u2019s newest architectural statement. Both buildings offer full-floor palaces high in the sky.\u201cYears ago we didn\u2019t have these kinds of properties,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cBut savvy developers realized that if you build it, they will come.\u201dNearby, a tower next to the Museum of Modern Art, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, is on the road to construction. So is 220 Central Park South, a limestone spire designed by Robert A. M. Stern. Around the city, other projects will compete for attention and dollars. It\u2019s not that the city lacked inventory. It has the most expensive real estate market in the country, with thousands of multimillion-dollar apartments, townhouses and mansions changing hands regularly. But as tastes changed, apartments that once appeared palatial now seem pedestrian. Today\u2019s new construction includes floor-to-ceiling windows, full-floor residences, opulent finishes and amenities like room service from Michelin-starred chefs. \u201cFor the superwealthy who are used to five- or six-star hotel services around the world, it\u2019s a really great way to not just travel now, but to live,\u201d Ms. Liebman said.Putting a price on such trophy properties is no science. \u201cArt is a closer analogy than stocks or bonds,\u201d said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate professor at Columbia University. \u201cWhat matters is the amount of this stuff available and the number of people looking at it.\u201d And to explain why buyers will pay such soaring prices, brokers often resort to metaphors, not mathematics. \u201cHow else do you explain $10,000 a square foot?\u201d said Mr. Henckels at Stribling & Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with the price for carats of a pink diamond or square inches of a Warhol.\u201dHowever, the Mona Lisa is one of the most reproduced artworks in the world. And as more such towers rise around Manhattan, the views and floor plans for which Mr. Ackman and others are paying top dollar may not be unique. \u201cThere\u2019s more space on Park Avenue than there are billionaires who want to live in New York,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. \u201cUnlike Picassos, there is not a finite number of these properties.\u201dEven Ms. Liebman, whose company represents sponsors of several new buildings, acknowledges that the market is becoming crowded. \u201cThere will be winners and losers,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cSome buildings are better than others. Savvy buyers will play the buildings against each other.\u201dFor now, however, demand is not ebbing. Foreign buyers continue to view New York real estate as a safe place to park money, keeping inventory tight and demand high. \u201cWe have the greatest influx of foreign buyers that we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cThe Chinese have made a huge impact on New York real estate along with Latin, European, Russian buyers. The past year has brought us a lot of Middle Eastern buyers.\u201dFor these buyers \u2014 oligarchs, international corporate chieftains and foreign royalty \u2014 who make up an estimated 30 to 50 percent of high-end buyers, there are various allures to Manhattan property. \u201cIt\u2019s a repository of money, it\u2019s in the dollar currency, and it\u2019s in New York City,\u201d said Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Company, whose projects include One57.Currency fluctuations, unpredictable world affairs and unstable governments contribute to the desire for a safe haven. \u201cIt can be a good idea to have money outside your home markets,\u201d Mr. Henckels said. \"Hardly any of these people are actually New York City residents.\u201dYet a market reliant on a small cadre of the world\u2019s richest men and women can also be fragile. \u201cA 50 percent drop in the price of oil is a huge risk,\u201d said Mr. Mayer of Columbia. \u201cA significant number of the world\u2019s billionaires rely on oil.\u201d But the higher the price, the more elusive the potential returns. If an apartment sold for $100 million today were to enjoy the same appreciation as the first resale at One57, it would trade hands for $111 million later this year. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical from here about how much appreciation there can be,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. And with so many other trophy properties coming to market, it is unclear if Mr. Ackman or others like him will be able to find a buyer soon. \u201cI am concerned,\u201d Mr. Henckels said. \u201cThe biggest question is, have we overbuilt luxury inventory, and I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201dOf course, this is not the first time that speculators have bet on Manhattan property or that critics have grumbled about a bubble. In the years before the financial crisis, two marquee properties hit the market and broke records. New construction at 15 Central Park West attracted prominent buyers looking for pristine new construction. And condominium conversions at the Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park proved alluring to moneyed buyers looking for a piece of old New York. At the time, critics thought buyers were overpaying and prices would never go higher. But over the last eight years, prices in those buildings have continued to rise. \u201cLook at the profits people have made there,\u201d Mr. Henckels said. At a certain point, however, logic fails to explain what are ultimately emotional decisions, and real estate experts again turn to the art world for explanations. \u201cThese guys will buy a $50 million to $100 million painting and put it on their wall,\u201d Mr. Barnett said. \u201cOr you can buy a $50- to $100-million piece of real estate that is probably more unique, and no one can steal it from you. Some people actually think that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Russia, With Capitalist Ambitions ", "Date": "2015-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesIn the early 1990s Bill Browder invested $2,000 in a handful of Polish companies being privatized after the collapse of Communism. Eastern Europe was dipping a toe into the cold bath of free-market capitalism, and Mr. Browder, fresh out of Stanford University\u2019s business school, wanted to jump in, too.Within two years after Hermitage\u2019s founding in 1996, its assets had swelled from $25 million to more than $1 billion, making Mr. Browder the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market. In 2000, Hermitage was named the best-performing emerging-markets fund in the world, having generated returns of 1,500 percent to its original investors. Its assets would grow to $4.5 billion by 2005.The lows, however, were very low. A hefty portion of the book describes Mr. Browder\u2019s frantic efforts to fight off a wolf pack of oligarchs trying to muscle in on Hermitage\u2019s action and strip its assets.The cut and thrust, and the high stakes, make for a zesty tale. Mr. Browder and his Russian team became adept at amassing scandalous information about their foes and then presenting the findings, tied up in a neat package, to Western journalists who could inflict maximum damage.Mr. Browder admits to a fatal miscalculation. He assumed that his foreign citizenship made him untouchable. In fact, he was living on borrowed time. When Vladimir V. Putin was intent on reining in the oligarchs, his interests and Mr. Browder\u2019s coincided. But at a certain point, they did not.In 2005, deemed a \u201cthreat to national security,\u201d Mr. Browder was kicked out of Russia, and his companies were seized. Later the Russian government asked Interpol to issue an all-points bulletin, or red notice, for his arrest on tax evasion charges. Interpol rejected the request, calling it politically motivated. Mr. Browder was then convicted by a Russian court in absentia. \u201cWhen the Russian government turns on you, it doesn\u2019t do so mildly \u2014 it does so with extreme prejudice,\u201d Mr. Browder notes ruefully.It\u2019s a Hollywood ending, right down to the standing ovation given by more than 700 European members of Parliament after passing the legislation.Mr. Browder makes an unlikely hero and even more unlikely capitalist. His grandfather was the head of the American Communist Party and featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1938 as \u201cComrade Earl Browder.\u201d Felix Browder, Earl\u2019s son, became a mathematics professor at the University of Chicago. Bill Browder\u2019s brother, Thomas, is an eminent particle physicist. \u201cIn my family, if you weren\u2019t a prodigy, you had no place on earth,\u201d he writes.Mr. Browder, by contrast, was a slacker. He goofed off at boarding school and barely made it into the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he spent his freshman year reliving \u201cAnimal House.\u201dIn the ultimate act of rebellion, he set his sights on a business career, a decision that straightened him out academically and no doubt would come as a shock to his grandfather. Adding insult to injury, Mr. Browder turned his gaze eastward, toward the former Communist heartland, with plunder on his mind.\u201cThe dominoes were falling: soon all of Eastern Europe would be free,\u201d he writes of the tumultuous weeks after the Berlin Wall came down. \u201cMy grandfather had been the biggest Communist in America, and as I watched these events unfold, I decided that I wanted to become the biggest capitalist in Eastern Europe.\u201dFor a while, he was. But as Mr. Magnitsky warned him, Russian stories never have happy endings.Mr. Browder concludes on a grim note. \u201cI have to assume that there is a very real chance that Putin or members of his regime will have me killed someday,\u201d he writes. For good measure, he adds, \u201cIf I\u2019m killed, you will know who did it.\u201dRED NOTICEA True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man\u2019s Fight for JusticeBy Bill BrowderIllustrated. 396 pages.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Council Had Eye on Markets in Weighing Asset-Purchase Program", "Date": "2015-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank conducted an exhaustive debate before deciding last month on measures to avert a catastrophic decline in consumer prices. But on Thursday the first glimpse ever into the deliberations revealed that, in effect, the decision had already been made.Statements by Mario Draghi, the central bank president, and other top officials had primed investors to expect a large-scale asset-purchase program that would include government bonds. The 25 members of the bank\u2019s Governing Council were well aware that if they delivered anything less after meeting on Jan. 22, there might have been chaos in the financial markets.Recent gains in stocks, declines in market interest rates and a welcome fall in the value of the euro against the dollar \u2014 it might have all come undone. Or as the central bank put it in an account of the meeting, which was released Thursday: \u201cThe associated positive impact on the growth and price outlook could be unwound, and a higher degree of volatility or instability in the financial markets could create additional risks.\u201dAt that meeting on Jan. 22, the Governing Council decided to begin buying government bonds and other debt at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, or $68.3 billion, beginning in March. Such purchases are a standard method for stimulating inflation but had never been tried by the central bank.The account contained few major surprises, much less any sense of drama or conflict. If any members pounded on the table or hurled invective, it was not recorded. The main significance of the account may come from what it disclosed about the power of Mr. Draghi and a few other top officials to manage market expectations in a way that created almost irresistible pressure for the central bank to act.Mr. Draghi has denied that he makes public statements that do not reflect Governing Council sentiment. But for months before the January meeting, he had been warning of the dangers of very low inflation and hinting that large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing, were becoming more likely.When the Governing Council gathered on Jan. 21 for the start of the two-day meeting in Frankfurt, some members were still arguing that quantitative easing should be used only in a dire situation that had not yet arrived.These members maintained that \u201cpurchases of sovereign bonds should remain a contingency instrument of monetary policy, to be used only as a last resort in the event of an extremely adverse scenario, such as a downward deflationary spiral,\u201d according to the account.But the wait-and-see faction was in the minority. Others heeded a warning from Peter Praet, a member of the central bank\u2019s six-person executive board. \u201cThe risks stemming from not acting at the present meeting,\u201d Mr. Praet said, according to a summary of his remarks, \u201cmight be higher than the risks stemming from acting.\u201d Mr. Praet cited the heightened market expectations as one of the risks.\u201cIt was clear that the E.C.B. had become prisoner of the expectations it had created in December,\u201d Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cAs financial markets had already strongly anticipated the announcement of a sovereign bond purchase program, failing to act could have created a dramatic market reversal.\u201dThe meeting account did not indicate which members of the Governing Council argued for delay, but one was almost certainly Jens Weidmann, president of Germany\u2019s central bank. He has been vocal in his opposition to purchases of government bonds, the same method used by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan to pump money into the economy after official interest rates had been cut to close to zero.While members disagreed on the timing of government bond purchases, they agreed that they were a legitimate tool of monetary policy allowed by European Union law, according to the account. That is significant, because the council\u2019s decision to begin buying government bonds is likely to face legal challenges from Germany and elsewhere.The Governing Council also agreed that the eurozone was not at imminent risk of deflation, even though inflation had sunk into negative territory for the first time since 2009. But many members worried that consumers and businesses were becoming accustomed to low inflation or even falling prices. In central bank jargon, inflation expectations were at risk of becoming \u201cunanchored.\u201dAs a result, businesses would not be able to raise prices and wages might fall, symptoms of deflation, a condition associated with high unemployment and economic depression.Furthermore, previous action by the central bank, like purchases of private sector assets, \u201chad clearly fallen short of initial expectations,\u201d the account said.After listening to the arguments, Mr. Draghi \u201cconcluded that a large majority of voting members supported a decision to launch an expanded asset purchase program.\u201dThe members made one decision that surprised markets. \u201cIn order to accelerate the impact,\u201d the Governing Council decided to increase the asset purchases to \u20ac60 billion a month instead of the expected \u20ac50 billion a month.By keeping the account of the debate largely anonymous, the council was trying to avoid subjecting members to pressure from their home constituencies. The 25 members of the council \u2014 the executive board members and the heads of the 19 national central banks in the eurozone \u2014 are not supposed to represent the interests of their home countries but rather the welfare of the currency bloc as a whole.The central bank plans to publish accounts of its monetary policy meetings four weeks after they take place. It does not plan to publish accounts of interim meetings, which deal with other matters. The monetary policy meetings are held every six weeks and are followed by a news conference with Mr. Draghi, the European Central Bank president.Advertisement"}

Humphrey, a Minnesota senator, and Augustus F.

It was based upon data on repeat sales of single-family homes.The index has since been calculated back to 1890 for 20 U.S. metropolitan areas and is widely watched for its ability to predict trends.Advertisement"}
