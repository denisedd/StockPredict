{"Headline": "36 Hours in Bologna, Italy", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by36 HoursScrappy, scruffy Bologna could easily coast on its history, if not just on its culinary history. Home to one of the world\u2019s oldest universities, this northern Italian city has contributed dozens of classic recipes and foods to the repertory of Italian cooking, including tortellini, tagliatelle and mortadella \u2014 the cold cut whose imitation is known as \u201cBologna\u201d \u2014 as well as rag\u00f9 Bolognese. As the capital of the region of Emilia-Romagna, Bologna is one of the best places to sample the cheeses, cured hams and vinegars that originate in the area, many of which have been famous for centuries. But modern Bologna is not just about the past. Dozens of cool new attractions have changed the face of the city, from new ways of eating to new museums and new bars. And although several of the city\u2019s brightest attractions have appeared only within the last two or three years, many more are yet to come, including Eataly World, a huge culinary theme park scheduled to open here sometime in the next few months.1. Museum Gizmos | 4 p.m.Catch up on the city\u2019s back story at the Museum of the History of Bologna. Housed inside a historic palazzo, the high-tech exhibits include a 3-D movie highlighting the city\u2019s Etruscan era, as well as a virtual-reality walk through old canals. Despite the many modern gizmos, the massive building \u2014 erected in 1344 \u2014 offers a real sense of the past. Afterward, walk a block or two under the city\u2019s beloved porticos until you reach the soaring Asinelli Tower, one of the Due Torri, or \u201ctwo towers,\u201d that have long symbolized the city. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no modern technology to help you here: You must climb the 498 rickety steps to the upper platform all by yourself. Rest assured that the panorama over all the ancient rooftops is worth the effort.2. High-Fired Pizza | 7 p.m.Since it opened in late 2012, the cool little cafe known by its address, Ranzani 13, has become one of the city\u2019s favorite casual dining spots, thanks to its excellent, high-fired pizzas, which include unusual combinations like smoked mozzarella with rapini, or Parma ham with gooey burrata cheese and sweet fresh figs. A second draw: the excellent beer list, which includes cult Italian brews like Birrificio Menaresta as well as European favorites like Bayerischer Bahnhof\u2019s sour-salty Gose. Make reservations: Ranzani 13 is airy, casual, inexpensive and extremely popular.3. Birra Crawl | 9 p.m.Famously idiosyncratic, Italian brewers have been making global headlines in recent years. Continue your testing of the country\u2019s pints at the tiny brewpub Birra Cerqua, which produces its own ales just behind the bar. On the other side of town \u2014 but only 20 minutes away by foot \u2014 several new attractions have opened in the trendy neighborhood around Via Del Pratello. Start at Beer for Bunnies, a year-old bottle shop with a couple of rotating brews on draft and a punkish vibe. Not far away, the new cafe-bar Il Punto serves five drafts from small producers like Birrificio Argo, as well as unusual beer snacks, including a beer cheese from Parma and a version of Bologna\u2019s classic tigella flatbread made from the grain left over after brewing. Finish up at a classic: La Tana del Luppolo, a neighborhood bar on a quiet, tree-lined square, which has been serving craft beers since before many of today\u2019s Italian craft breweries even existed.4. The Motor Valley | 10 a.m.Emilia-Romagna is most famous as a producer of great foods, but car lovers call the region around Bologna the Motor Valley, with a number of luxury automobile manufacturers, many of which welcome visitors. In the neighboring town of Modena \u2014 home of the great balsamic vinegar \u2014 the Museo Enzo Ferrari opened in 2012, showcasing a handful of classic cars amid a bombastic multimedia spectacle that compares Enzo Ferrari to another local hero, Luciano Pavarotti. From here, shuttle buses ferry visitors past Pavarotti\u2019s home to the equally over-the-top Museo Ferrari in the factory town of Maranello. Far more subdued is the excellent Ferruccio Lamborghini Museo, which moved to a new, larger building in the nearby town of Funo di Argelato, just north of Bologna, in 2013. With any luck, your tour guide will be the charming Fabio Lamborghini, nephew of the famous industrialist, who can tell you intimate family stories about the large collection of Lamborghini cars, tractors, speedboats and even a prototype helicopter.5. New Market | NoonWhile everyone awaits the opening of Bologna\u2019s Eataly World, a sprawling complex of restaurants, grocery stores, food labs and cooking classrooms, the reopening of the barnlike Mercato di Mezzo market building in April of 2014 brought a new foodie destination to the heart of the city\u2019s traditional market district, the Quadrilatero. Though many shoppers come here for fancy groceries, Mercato di Mezzo also makes a great lunch spot: upstairs, a small Eataly pizzeria bakes high-end pies made with organic flour in a wood-fired oven, while the half-dozen stands on the ground floor offer delicious meals like handmade tortelloni with taleggio and walnuts, sliced prosciutto and fresh fish.6. Local Ink | 3 p.m.Add a collectible pen to your list of potential souvenirs and gifts, starting with Bologna\u2019s own Omas brand. Founded in 1928, the A. C. Vecchietti pen shop stocks classics like the Omas fountain pen with a white-gold nib and a motif depicting the city\u2019s beautiful porticos (310 euros, or about $336 at $1.09 to the euro), as well as modern designs like the sleek new Cambiano inkless pen (89 euros), created by the Pininfarina design studio in 2014.7. Concentrated Flavors | 4 p.m.If you love ice cream, you may be tempted to visit the new Gelato Museum, which opened just outside Bologna in 2012, but fair warning: Reservations are mandatory for all visits, and the remote location is not very easy to reach by public transportation. A better alternative: Head to the city\u2019s best-loved producer, Stefino, which reopened in a new location on Via San Vitale in 2013, serving unusual organic gelato with highly concentrated flavors, like fragrant almond and decadent melted chocolate. For a palate cleanser, enjoy a sharply acidic lemon granita under the portico outside, then return to sample more gelato flavors, from pistachio to wasabi.After your gelato, shop for new \u2014 or actually old \u2014 clothes among the shady porticos just west of the Piazza Maggiore. At the stylish Fratelli Broche vintage shop, try out Trussardi handbags (80 euros) and vintage sunglasses (usually around 30 euros). Down the block and around the corner, La Leonarda has tons of cool \u201950s neckties and raincoats, while the nearby Zenobialand boutique stocks cute vintage dresses and antique purses.9. Anti-Tortellini Upstart | 7:30 p.m.Bologna might be famous as a town for food lovers, but last fall\u2019s arrival of Red Brick brought in a brand-new culinary focus: meat in all its glory, from T-bones to hamburgers, served in a modern bistro atmosphere with exposed red brick and graffiti-style artworks. In addition to the great steaks and burgers, Red Brick makes an excellent beef tartare, as well as a juicy, clove-scented pastrami sandwich, plated in a pool of rich jus, and tender, slow-cooked Wagyu beef cubes accompanied by onions roasted in stout beer. Though tarred by local detractors as a heretically \u201canti-tortellini\u201d restaurant, Red Brick manages to make its foreign recipes and techniques seem decidedly at home in food-loving Bologna, thanks to great service, clever platings and a well-chosen list of Italian wines and beers.Italy\u2019s moviemaking capital is the Cinecitt\u00e0 in Rome, but one of the country\u2019s most important resources for historic film is Cineteca di Bologna, which restores and archives movies from around the globe, with special programs dedicated to Pier Paolo Pasolini and Charlie Chaplin, as well as a major film library for students. In addition to restoration work, the Cineteca also shows films at various local theaters during Cinema Ritrovato, its festival of revival and historic movies. Catch one of the classics \u2014 or a modern, first-run blockbuster \u2014 at the Cineteca\u2019s own screening rooms, Cinema Lumi\u00e8re, then meet up with other cinephiles at one of the many nearby bars and cafes, which often make the surrounding neighborhood feel like a giant weekend street party.11. Photo Works | 11 a.m.Visit the cool new Mast Gallery, which offers free entry to all its regular exhibitions, including interactive displays dedicated to design and technology. Opened in 2013 in a run-down, former industrial zone west of the city center, the modern building also hosts its own biennale, dedicated to industrial photography, which runs through Jan. 10.The 36 Hours column last Sunday, about Bologna, Italy, misspelled part of the name of a film restoration and archiving venue. It is Cineteca di Bologna, not Cinoteca di Bologna.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Stock Markets End Higher Though Global Concerns Linger", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks in the United States bounced back on Wednesday, a day after another sell-off on the global markets, even as worries about economic growth persisted.The decline on Tuesday followed a weak Chinese report on manufacturing that heightened broader concerns about global economic growth. Some analysts said it was too early to tell whether Wednesday\u2019s market gains were a sign that stocks were close to bottoming out.\u201cWe are getting a little bit of a letup today, but the headache may continue,\u201d said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at KeyBank.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 1.8 percent to end at 1,948.86. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 300 points, closing up 1.8 percent, to 16,351.38. Technology shares were particularly higher, with the Nasdaq composite index gaining 2.5 percent.The S.&P. 500 is now 8.54 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The Dow Jones industrial average is 10.71 percent below its peak. After its surge on Wednesday, the Nasdaq is still nearly 9 percent off its high.As welcome as Wednesday\u2019s recovery was to many investors, they are expected to keep watching for signs of weakness in China \u2014 although they will have a two-day break, with markets there closed the rest of the week.The Shanghai composite index closed down 0.2 percent on Wednesday, leaving it almost 40 percent lower than its recent peak. A late rally was driven by huge trading volume, suggesting government intervention in the market.The weakness in Chinese shares was by no means the worst the country has seen over the last month, but coming ahead of closely stage-managed celebrations in China to commemorate the end of World War II, it has raised concerns about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic growth.In particular, international investors and economists worry that heavy-handed state intervention to prop up sagging stocks, and poor communication before a currency devaluation in August, signal uncharacteristic sloppiness from the technocrats who have guided China\u2019s steady rise in gross domestic product over the last three decades.\u201cThere are growing doubts about China\u2019s leadership and the direction of the economy,\u201d Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments, wrote in a note. \u201cIndeed, some have even begun to question whether the Chinese government has \u2018lost control\u2019 of the economy.\u201dIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng closed 1.2 percent lower, while the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed 0.4 percent lower.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved up slightly on Wednesday, to 2.19 percent from 2.16 percent on Tuesday. Yields move in the opposite direction from prices. Investors have often piled into United States government bonds as a safe-haven investment during periods of instability in the markets. But the 10-year note has not rallied sharply during the latest sell-off in the stock market.Some analysts said this could indicate that most investors were not expecting a severe downturn.\u201cBonds would be showing a lot more activity if investors felt this was going to lead to a recession or a bear market,\u201d Mr. McCain of KeyBank said.Major European indexes moved higher. The FTSE 100-stock index in London ended up 0.4 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.3 percent.Despite the worries about China, most analysts say they believe that the country will be able to avoid a sharp economic slowdown. But restoring confidence in its stock markets, they say, will require continued loosening of monetary policy by the Chinese central bank, initiatives like share buybacks from companies and broader market-oriented changes.The Chinese government\u2019s continued direct intervention in the market, on the other hand, will strengthen concerns, according to an analyst\u2019s note from Citibank.\u201cSignificant reduction of administrative intervention into domestic equities is more important to regain global investors\u2019 confidence,\u201d the note said.Even so, China\u2019s largest brokerage firms, under the direction of regulators, have vowed to pour in additional investments to support the equity markets, according to a number of recent filings with the stock exchanges. For example, in a note on Tuesday, Haitong Securities said it would invest an additional 4.5 billion renminbi, or roughly $700 million, on top of the 15 billion renminbi it had pledged to a stock market bailout fund.The move was made \u201cto maintain the long-term stability of the securities market, promote the positive role of a securities company and fulfill its corporate social responsibility,\u201d Haitong said in its filing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Though analysts say such moves will eventually help support the market, many also worry that the measures indicate that the broader Chinese economy could be in worse shape than official data suggests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Glencore Shares Recover a Bit After Plunging Monday", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Shares of the Swiss mining giant Glencore recovered some of their losses in early trading in London on Tuesday after Citigroup analysts suggested that the company should be taken private if the stock market continued to not value it \u201cfairly.\u201dGlencore\u2019s stock has been under pressure as analysts and investors have expressed concern about the company\u2019s heavy debt and weakness in commodities pricing.Based in Baar, Switzerland, Glencore buys and sells commodities, like coal and cooper, as part of its trading arm and mines those commodities as well.But shares of Glencore recovered some of their losses and rose nearly 8 percent in early trading in London on Tuesday. The company\u2019s stock recently traded up more than 8 percent in midday trading in London.In their note on Tuesday, the Citigroup analysts said they believed the sell-off in Glencore was \u201coverdone\u201d and it was not likely that the company\u2019s debt would be downgraded by ratings agencies to so-called junk status.\u201cWe believe that in the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly, with a potential float of just the industrial business occurring further down the track,\u201d the Citigroup analysts said in a research note on Tuesday.A Glencore spokeswoman declined to comment on the Citigroup note.Citigroup is Glencore\u2019s corporate broker and was one of the banks leading its share placement this month.In their note, the Citigroup analysts suggested that there was a \u201cpotential upside\u201d that the company could exceed the $2 billion target from its asset sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Response to Stock Plunge Rattles Traders", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Communist Party\u2019s response to China\u2019s monthslong stock market crisis has been swift and forceful. In addition to spending as much as $235 billion to buy shares and bolster prices, the authorities have imposed a range of extraordinary restrictions on the sale of stocks \u2014 and backed them with the full weight of a security apparatus usually more focused on political dissent than equity trades.After decades of watching China make slow but steady progress in building Western-style financial markets, many are now asking whether the party is reversing course \u2014 and whether Chinese officials are willing to tolerate the sometimes turbulent waves of selling that are inherent to such markets.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in China is definitively spooking people,\u201d said Dawn Fitzpatrick, the chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, a $5.6 billion hedge fund owned by UBS. \u201cThey\u2019ve set themselves back a couple of years\u201d in terms of attracting investment, she added.Anxiety in the industry surged last week after Li Yifei, the prominent China chief of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded hedge fund, disappeared and Bloomberg News reported that she had been taken into custody to assist a police inquiry into market volatility. Her employer, the London-based Man Group, did little to dispel fears, declining to comment on her whereabouts.Ms. Li resurfaced on Sunday and denied that she had been detained, saying that she had been in \u201can industry meeting\u201d and \u201cmeditating\u201d at a Taoist retreat. But many in the finance sector are unconvinced.\u201cThere is, generally, a very nervous atmosphere, as people wait to see the outcome of some of these investigations and how deep the rabbit hole goes,\u201d said Effie Vasilopoulos, a partner at the Hong Kong office of the Sidley Austin law firm who works with hedge funds that invest in mainland China. \u201cHow wide a net is the government going to cast in terms of looking at foreign firms and their operations \u2014 not just onshore, but also offshore as well?\u201dThe authorities are canvassing industry players in several cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Police officers under the Chinese Ministry of Public Security specializing in economic crimes have joined agents from the nation\u2019s securities regulator on inspections of investment funds and brokerage firms. The authorities are combing records and questioning transactions that appear to profit from or contribute to a falling market, according to employees of investment firms who, like others who spoke anonymously, said they feared reprisals.Police officers have downloaded extensive trading data and asked fund managers why they sold shares when the market was going down, prompting discussions about basic investment strategy. Officers have bluntly told some fund managers to just stop selling.While regulators and law enforcement elsewhere in the world routinely meet with investment companies to monitor trading for potential abuse and illegal activity, they seldom do so with the aim of steering the direction of the markets.The government has offered few details about the various investigations, contributing to the atmosphere of uncertainty. In late August, it announced the arrests of eight executives at state-owned Citic Securities, the country\u2019s largest brokerage firm and investment bank, including four members of its senior management, on suspicion of insider trading.At least four other brokerage firms said last month that they were being investigated by regulators for failing to properly identify their clients.While insider trading is common in China\u2019s relatively opaque markets, the investigations also serve the government\u2019s short-term goal of discouraging sales and stabilizing prices, said Chris Powers, a senior consultant at Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consulting firm in Shanghai. \u201cIs this more about limiting supposed market manipulation, or is it about sending a message to the market as a whole and using these cases as examples?\u201d he asked.Starting in the middle of last year, China\u2019s markets enjoyed a breathtaking rally driven by record levels of margin financing, or borrowing to invest in stocks, and strong signals of government support, including cheery reports on the bull market in official news outlets like People\u2019s Daily. But the Shanghai composite index has fallen 37 percent since the sell-off began in June, and the government has intervened directly and repeatedly in an attempt to support prices.The measures include restrictions on short-selling, or betting that stocks will fall. Regulators in the United States took similar action for a month at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, but the Chinese authorities have been vague about what kinds of transactions have been prohibited and for how long. The police have said they are investigating \u201cmalicious\u201d short-selling but have not said what that entails.The crackdown on short-selling and other trading strategies has been particularly disruptive for hedge funds, which depend on such trades to balance risks and limit losses.\u201cThey seem to be harassing anybody that they thought was selling or was short,\u201d said one hedge fund manager in Hong Kong who does not have investments on the mainland. \u201cHello, it\u2019s a hedge fund \u2014 they are long and short \u2014 but China is only looking at the short side.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The government has also suspended initial public offerings and prohibited investors who own more than 5 percent of a company from selling shares.While central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan have used unconventional monetary policy in recent years to stimulate growth and lift markets, China\u2019s intervention has been more direct, with the government ordering brokerage firms to contribute to a bailout fund. In a report this week, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that entities directed by the Chinese government have spent about 1.5 trillion renminbi, or $235 billion, buying shares to support the market.Censors have ordered the Chinese news media to avoid any reporting that might result in a market sell-off. With the economy growing at its slowest pace in a quarter-century and the party leadership worried about social unrest, discussion of the markets can draw official scrutiny almost as quickly as political speech.One hedge-fund manager based in Hong Kong said that he was cashing out most of the nearly $500 million he has invested in the mainland because of fears that his money could get tied up by new rules, with no legal recourse. \u201cI\u2019m worried about more systemic risks\u201d and \u201cthe witch hunt that is going on,\u201d he said.Another fund manager, in Singapore, said his colleagues in China were finding ways to take vacations outside of China because of a perception in the industry that the environment was becoming increasingly hostile.Though foreign investors are being singled out, only about 1 percent of China\u2019s $6.4 trillion domestic market value is owned by such investors, according to estimates by UBS, the investment bank.In recent years, some financial officials and regulators have started developing more sophisticated investment tools for the Chinese stock market, like futures and derivatives. But regulators are unlikely in the current environment to continue with such experiments, analysts said. On Sept. 2, China\u2019s futures exchange, an important platform for hedging, announced new restrictions that quickly led to a severe drop in trading volume.\u201cFor investors, if you can\u2019t hedge, it makes it hard to mitigate any sort of risk,\u201d he added, arguing that would \u201cultimately limit the wealth of the equities market\u201d in China.Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, which analyzes the Chinese economy for investors, said the restrictions on selling had turned the Chinese stock market into \u201ca roach motel for capital.\u201d\u201cYou can enter,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you want to leave, you have to be really fleet about it because you\u2019re mostly not going to get out.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, Neil Gough from Hong Kong and Alexandra Stevenson from New York.

The people spoke on the condition of anonymity.Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, just reported a 13.2 percent return. Bowdoin College, a far smaller school with a $1.3 billion endowment, this week reported returns of 14.6 percent.Still, results varied widely. The University of Texas Management, which has $26.6 billion to manage, reported that it had a weighted 3.5 percent return for its two funds.In the last fiscal year, private equity and real estate fared particularly well. Although Harvard did not disclose its asset allocation in its most recent report, it had roughly 20 percent of its assets in private equity in the 2014 fiscal year; Yale, by contrast, had about 33 percent of assets in that sector. Harvard\u2019s decision not to provide its asset allocation numbers made it harder to evaluate the impact of allocation decisions on performance.And although Harvard outperformed the internal benchmarks it sets for itself in all but the \u201cabsolute\u201d or hedge fund category, the outperformance may not necessarily have been as impressive as those at other endowments. There were, however, some savvy moves, such as eliminating investment in commodity indexes when such investments were posting steep declines.Endowment performance is crucial at all colleges because a portion of the returns are used to finance their annual budgets. Harvard relies on the endowment for roughly 35 percent of its yearly expenses.Still the Harvard endowment\u2019s leadership team has had a lot of turnover ever since Jack Meyer stepped down as its head in 2005. Harvard had \u2014 and continues to have \u2014 a strategy in which a portion of its money is managed internally and a portion is managed externally by investment firms including hedge funds. It is the only large university to use such an approach. Most endowment chiefs allocate the school\u2019s funds to outside managers.In a long letter released with the performance figures, Mr. Blyth signaled that he intended to keep with Harvard\u2019s history of managing some of its money internally, but he suggested that he would make changes.For example, he wrote that he would aim to have his internal money managers work more closely with one another by tying their compensation not just to the assets each one managed but also how the endowment as a whole performed.Still, Harvard may not pay the same sums as private firms, which could lead to difficulties in attracting and keeping talent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Perils of Forcing a Sale of Illiquid Assets", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealbook ColumnBoaz Weinstein, the hedge fund manager famous for betting against the JPMorgan Chase trader known as the \u201cLondon Whale,\u201d is being accused of his own accounting chicanery.In a case that could have chilling lessons for investors in certain kinds of illiquid assets, Mr. Weinstein \u2014 a chess master who made his career exposing and gambling on mispriced assets \u2014 is being sued by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada, formerly the largest investor in his hedge fund, Saba Capital.The pension fund sought to liquidate its investment in Mr. Weinstein\u2019s fund earlier this year after he piled up a string of losses over the last two years.The pension fund estimated it was owed $500 million and gave Mr. Weinstein less than two months to refund the money.Mr. Weinstein pleaded with the pension fund to allow him to pay it back in installments over several quarters, arguing that it would be difficult to get top dollar for some of the most illiquid assets \u2014 like corporate bonds \u2014 which would otherwise be valued at fire-sale prices.The pension fund said no. It wanted the money immediately.So Mr. Weinstein set about conducting an auction for the corporate bonds, but only three of nine dealers made bids.As might be expected, the valuations ascribed to the bonds were significantly less than their original value. Now the pension fund is claiming in a lawsuit that it got about $12 million less than it should have for those illiquid assets, contending that Mr. Weinstein \u201cimproperly manipulated the values of certain of the funds\u2019 assets with the objective of artificially depressing the price paid\u201d to the fund.The lawsuit \u2014 and the valuation that the fund received \u2014 illustrate an issue that has been bubbling up over the last year: It is very possible that a liquidity panic could lead to the next financial crisis.William H. Gross, the bond investor, sounded the alarm earlier this summer on \u201cpossible exit and liquidity problems in future months and years.\u201d The potential for such a crisis isn\u2019t restricted to large pension funds and wealthy investors.\u201cMutual funds, hedge funds and E.T.F.s are part of the \u2018shadow banking system,\u2019 where these modern \u2018banks\u2019 are not required to maintain reserves or even emergency levels of cash,\u201d Mr. Gross wrote in a letter to investors. \u201cSince they in effect now are the market, a rush for liquidity on the part of the investing public, whether they be individuals in 401(k)\u2019s or institutional pension funds and insurance companies, would find the \u2018market\u2019 selling to itself with the Federal Reserve severely limited in its ability to provide assistance.\u201dWhether Mr. Weinstein valued the assets in his fund properly or not will be up the court to decide. Many facts on both sides that are necessary to truly understand what happened have yet to emerge.But what we do know from the lawsuit is that Mr. Weinstein had to value his portfolio as if it were being sold tomorrow, and it demonstrates, at least to some degree, that selling illiquid assets in a hurry usually results in sharply lower prices.Stephen A. Schwarzman, co-founder and chairman of the Blackstone Group, is a Wall Street veteran who has been anxious that many regulations put in place since 2008 have made it harder for banks to act as intermediaries and stand in to buy assets if the markets seize up.\u201cA liquidity drought can exacerbate, or even trigger, the next financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman wrote in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. \u201cSellers will offer securities, but there will be no buyers. Prices will drop sharply, causing large losses for investors, pension funds and financial institutions. Additional fire sales will aggravate the decline.\u201dNot everyone is convinced a liquidity crisis is upon us. Matt Levine, a columnist for Bloomberg View, calls it \u201cthe liquidity illusion,\u201d which he defines as a narrative that \u201cbig investors buy a lot of bonds thinking that they\u2019ll be easy to unload in a crash, but in fact they won\u2019t be easy to unload, and there\u2019ll be panicked fire sales that worsen the crash and lead to a real crisis.\u201dHe asks: \u201cHow is that illusion tenable when everyone talks about it all the time? What big investor is suffering from the liquidity illusion? Presumably not all the investors who are quoted constantly in stories about the liquidity illusion, right?\u201dIf Mr. Weinstein wins the case, the Canadian pension fund may have suffered the liquidity illusion.Others have suffered the liquidity illusion, too. General Electric\u2019s sale of its GE Capital unit could be described as a case study on what happens when you try to sell illiquid assets quickly.The company is in the process of selling down its GE Capital business, worth some $500 billion in relatively illiquid assets. It recently took a $16.4 billion charge. While it might not be directly analogous to the fire sale of illiquid corporate bonds, and that charge figure includes some accounting issues, it shows how difficult it is to sell large amounts of assets at one time.\u201cThe suggestion that Saba \u2018shopped for lowball bids\u2019 for two bonds in our portfolio is ludicrous and totally unsubstantiated,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said in a statement. \u201cOn the contrary, Saba initiated an industry-standard auction process to determine the value of the two bonds. This allowed us to determine objectively the level of interest by real-life purchasers, instead of relying on subjective estimates for extremely illiquid instruments in which institutional trading was virtually nonexistent.\u201d He added: \u201cThe suggestion that I manipulated the valuation of two bonds for my personal gain is utter nonsense.\u201dA spokesman for the pension fund, Mark Boutet, said, \u201cSince this matter is before the courts, we are not commenting.\u201dWe\u2019ll see what the courts eventually have to say about all of this. But that could take years, and we might see a liquidity crisis \u2014 and many more cases like this one \u2014 first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi Says E.C.B. Is Ready to Expand Stimulus, but Not Yet", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the central bank will not act until it has more information about the effect of a slowdown in emerging markets and other risks, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. Also on Thursday, the central bank cut its previous growth forecasts for the eurozone economies because of the global turbulence.\u201cThe Governing Council wanted to emphasize its willingness to act, its readiness to act and its ability to act,\u201d Mr. Draghi said after a meeting of the council, the bank\u2019s policy board.For now, the central bank still needs to assess whether what is happening in the rest of the world is \u201cworsening our medium-term outlook or is just a transitory thing,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll decide whether to do more or not.\u201dStaff economists at the European Central Bank, in a report issued Thursday, scaled back their eurozone growth projections for this year and through 2017, citing lower demand from emerging markets \u2014 a clear reference to the repercussions of the economic slowdown in China.Growth in the 19 countries of the eurozone will be 1.4 percent this year, central bank economists said, compared with a forecast of 1.5 percent that they made in June. Inflation is now projected at 0.1 percent for the year, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.2 percent.Analysts had not expected such a robust indication of stronger stimulus, and some took it as a sign that the Governing Council had grown comfortable deploying measures that were extremely controversial only a few months ago. A long debate had preceded the central bank\u2019s decision in January to begin buying government bonds and other assets to pump money into the eurozone economy. Opponents on the council had argued that the government bond purchases violated a provision in the central bank\u2019s charter that prohibits it from financing governments.\u201cI don\u2019t think resistance within the E.C.B. council is a major argument\u201d against additional action, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.European stocks, which had already been up for the day, were further buoyed by Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks. The euro also fell against the dollar, which bolsters the eurozone economy because it makes European exports cheaper abroad.The only concrete change in monetary policy by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday was to raise self-imposed limits on how much it can buy of any single government\u2019s or private lender\u2019s bond issue. The change gives the central bank more leeway to increase the asset purchases that it began in March as a way of pumping money into the eurozone economy and forcing down interest rates.\u201cOnce again the E.C.B. has managed to provoke a desired market reaction (particularly a weakening of the euro) without any actual change in policy,\u201d Karen Ward, senior global economist at HSBC Bank, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was prepared to adjust the \u201csize, composition and duration\u201d of that program if necessary. Many economists now expect it to act before the end of the year, by raising the volume of assets it buys or by extending the program beyond September 2016, or both.Mr. Draghi declined to comment on what effect Fed policy would have on the eurozone, except to say that if a rate increase is necessary to achieve \u201cthe objectives of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, this is a plus for the world.\u201dThough the central bank displayed a willingness to increase its stimulus measures, it remains reluctant to apply the stimulus to Greece.Mr. Draghi said it was too soon to make that move, however. As Greece reaches various milestones in its bailout program in the coming months, he said, the European Central Bank would assess whether to begin buying Greek bonds.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poised for Rate Increase, Investors Hope for Small Ripples ", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe moment that Wall Street has long been dreading could happen this week.History, however, shows that booms financed with cheap money often leave the financial system weaker, not stronger. And the fault lines start to become obvious only when the Fed starts to tighten monetary policy.This time around, most analysts aren\u2019t expecting 2008-style instability, unless, say, China\u2019s economic problems worsen sharply. The Obama administration\u2019s overhaul of Wall Street appears to have made the largest banks more resilient to the sort of stress that can follow an increase in interest rates.\u201cI believe that Wall Street is better prepared for a market event than it was in 2008, partially as a result of regulation but, more importantly, as a result of experience,\u201d said Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A liftoff in rates may not happen this week. After a violent downturn in global stock markets last month, prompted by concerns about China, traders are now betting that the big day is more likely to happen at the Fed\u2019s December meeting.But an increase in rates, whenever it comes, could still roil markets, make it harder for many firms to raise money and expose new frailties in the system that postcrisis regulations have not properly addressedIn theory, a small increase in interest rates \u2014 the Fed is expected to raise them by only a quarter of a percentage point this year \u2014 should not be enough to wreak havoc. If the real economy is reasonably healthy and corporate earnings continue to grow steadily, which seems possible, then stock and bond prices should not be vulnerable.Still, some analysts have a darker view of the links between the Fed\u2019s $3.5 trillion stimulus, Wall Street and the wider economy. They say that financial markets have played a central role in funneling trillions of dollars into investments that will prove unsustainable when interest rates go up.\u201cThe Fed is supposed to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in an email exchange. \u201cIt is already well past midnight, but the guests will keep partying until they drop if you ply them with even more alcohol.\u201dAnd signs of excess abound.Technology companies have been able to raise large sums even before they tap the public markets. This is a sign that investors are so hungry for a stake in the latest boom in Silicon Valley that they are willing to tolerate long waits before they can sell out and are willing to forgo more detailed financial statements.The debt markets have long appeared overly eager to lend. Around the world, companies with a credit rating that is B or lower \u2014 the less creditworthy of the junk bond issuers \u2014 have sold debt worth $1.24 trillion since the start of 2009, when the Fed\u2019s stimulus began in earnest, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That sum is nearly three times the total for the 10 years before 2009.At the same time, low interest rates have made investors more willing to buy stocks at historically high valuations. The low rates have also made it cheaper for companies to borrow money they can use to buy back their own shares. Repurchases of stock can bolster a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 an important measure of a corporation\u2019s profitability \u2014 because they reduce the number of shares outstanding.But stock buybacks do not improve the underlying performance of companies. Since 2012, quarterly earnings per share at companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have on average grown by 6.7 percent a year. A fifth of that growth rate has come from buybacks, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank.Because these sorts of financial activities have been going on for so long, the doomsayers say they are vulnerable to a slight increase in interest rates. Companies may find it much harder to raise money, leading them to curtail buybacks and, much more important, shelve investments.Such a reversal is already causing stress in large developing countries like China and Brazil. Fears that weakness in emerging markets might end up damping growth in developed economies were behind the steep sell-off in stock markets in August.But many of the gloomier analysts have been predicting a great reckoning for years \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t happened. The excesses in the system, for instance, may not be as widespread as in past booms. The new restraints on Wall Street and the housing market have so far prevented a resurgence of the toxic real estate lending that occurred when interest rates were low a decade ago.It is also not clear that the Fed\u2019s easy money policies have been that easy. After accounting for inflation, corporations are not borrowing more cheaply than they did in the past. Since the end of 2008, the average, inflation-adjusted yield on corporate bonds of moderate credit risk has been 4.1 percent, compared with 3.94 percent for most of the postwar period.At the same time, the Fed\u2019s policies appear to have prompted a surge in a type of lending that might prove more stable than the securities markets under higher interest rates. In the last five years, banks of all sizes, often operating far away from Wall Street, have increased loans to corporations by over $700 billion, or 61 percent.In any case, a rise in interest rates may not prompt companies to slash the size of their stock buyback programs. An analysis by Deutsche Bank suggests that companies\u2019 cash holdings and cash flows generated by their operations could cover their buybacks. The analysis also shows that companies\u2019 debt loads, when measured against their market value, are at historical lows.And if buybacks do become less attractive to corporations, there could be a silver lining. It might prompt executives to instead invest spare capital in their operations as they seek higher productivity.\u201cIt would mark a shift toward the old-fashioned growth model,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm.The performance of exchange-traded funds in the recent sell-offs may be a foretaste of what might happen. For a short period on Aug. 24, shares in some funds fell to prices that were well below the value that they would have commanded had they stayed in line with the worth of the fund\u2019s underlying holdings. An investor selling at that discount might take an unnecessary loss.\u201cThe implication of E.T.F.s and their disconnect from their underlying securities is very worrying,\u201d Mr. Levitt, the former regulator, said. \u201cThat has a tendency to create great uncertainty in the markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Companies Joining Climate Change Efforts ", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor example, Procter & Gamble, the world\u2019s largest consumer-products company, said it would convert to 30 percent renewable energy by 2020, up from 7 percent today. The new target, a culmination of years of environmental efforts by the company, means that Bounty paper towels, Charmin toilet tissue, Tide detergent and many other goods commonly found in American pantries will increasingly be made with green energy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that we think climate change is something that\u2019s real and needs to be addressed,\u201d Len Sauers, P.&G.\u2019s vice president for global sustainability, said in an interview. \u201cPeople that use our products expect a company like P.&G. to be responsible.\u201dThis week\u2019s event comes just ahead of an address to Congress by Pope Francis, who is expected to reiterate his strong stand on the issue, and two months ahead of a meeting in Paris where negotiators will try to strike a broad new global deal to limit the emissions causing the planet to warm.Companies have realized that cutting their energy use can save money. But they are also under pressure from consumers, particularly younger ones, to take action, and many companies have begun to see their environmental efforts as a core part of their business strategy.The efforts include less overall use of energy and water, more recycling, more use of renewable energy, and a wave of promises to improve the supply chains for commodities like soybeans, palm oil and beef. These are often produced in the tropics, creating powerful financial incentives to chop down forests, which not only contributes to global warming but destroys some the world\u2019s richest biological regions.Two commodity companies, Bunge, of White Plains, N.Y., and Astra Agro Lestari, of Indonesia, announced strong policies in recent days meant to reduce deforestation. Glenn Hurowitz, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank, described the Astra announcement as especially significant, given the palm oil company\u2019s political influence in Indonesia, a country that has seen rampant deforestation in recent years.However, Mr. Hurowitz and several other environmental advocates strongly criticized another company, Cargill, of Minnetonka, Minn. That giant commodity processor had signed a declaration in New York a year ago that committed many commodity firms to help end deforestation globally by 2020, yet a recent policy from Cargill does not commit to ending it entirely before 2030.\u201cCargill is being left in the dust by its competitors in the race to provide environmentally responsible products to customers who demand them,\u201d Mr. Hurowitz said.A Cargill spokesman, Chris Schraeder, rejected the criticism and said Cargill was working as hard as possible to halt deforestation in its supply chain. \u201cWe believe our global policy is more extensive than anything else in our industry and we have action plans to show how we\u2019re getting to our no-deforestation goal,\u201d Mr. Schraeder said in a statement.Many climate activists are working to persuade pension funds, universities, churches and other groups that hold endowments to divest from fossil fuel stocks. The activists blame the major fossil companies for blocking strong political action on emissions.The demand to divest first arose several years ago on college campuses. A year ago, the assets under management by organizations that had pledged to divest totaled about $50 billion.On Tuesday, Arabella Advisors, a firm focused on socially responsible finance, reported that the sum had grown to $2.6 trillion, a measure of the movement\u2019s rapid spread and its success at convincing Wall Street money managers that fossil fuel stocks may be a risky long-term investment.\u201cThat\u2019s real money,\u201d said Ellen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, a charity that has backed divestment and that commissioned the Arabella report.Organizations committed to some form of divestment now include some of the world\u2019s major pension funds and other large pools of investment capital. The latest to divest, on Tuesday, was the charitable foundation created by the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who has long been active in environmental causes.While the managers committing to divest may oversee $2.6 trillion of investments, it is not clear how much of that money is actually parked in fossil fuel stocks. While the sum is almost certainly in the tens of billions, the exact amount is essentially impossible to track since the investment positions of large money managers tend to change by the day.Nor is it clear whether the divestment campaign is putting downward pressure on share prices. Almost all the fossil fuel stocks are down, some drastically, over the last few years with weakening global demand for coal, as well as oil production so robust it has saturated the market.At a news conference on Tuesday, climate activists pointed out that universities rejecting divestment, as many have done, would probably have avoided substantial investment losses over the last few years if they had heeded their own students.\u201cI invite you to stand with students, or get out of the way,\u201d said Alden Phinney, a student divestment activist from the University of California, Santa Cruz. In a briefing on Tuesday, leaders of the American Petroleum Institute criticized the divestment campaign as unrealistic, and released a report stating that their industry is helping to finance technologies that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. \u201cThere are those who would advocate for no fossil fuels at all, which is frankly irresponsible, since the United States depends on fossil fuels to meet 80 percent of its energy needs,\u201d said Jack N. Gerard, president of the petroleum institute.One coal company, Peabody Energy, has begun warning investors that the divestment campaign could be a material risk to its business. But most fossil fuel companies are not offering any such warning.In fact, though the companies have discovered several times more reserves of fossil fuels than scientists say the world can safely afford to burn, they are spending several hundred billion dollars a year looking for additional coal, oil and natural gas.Advertisement"}

Yale\u2019s average annualized return was 10 percent. Bowdoin stands at 10.5 percent, and M.I.T. was also higher.Princeton, too, is likely to exceed Yale\u2019s long-term performance. The average annual return for colleges and universities in the period was 6.6 percent.Over a 20-year period, however, Yale remains the leader with an average annual return of 13.7 percent.Mr. Swensen said that for Yale, last year was a \u201cwonderful year for venture capital.\u201d He added that Yale had a target of about 30 percent of its assets in investments that are not correlated to the market \u2014 including absolute return funds, bonds and cash.At Yale, the largest percentage of its fund, 21 percent, was invested in absolute return investment. The rest of the mix included leveraged buyouts at 13.8 percent and foreign stocks at about 14 percent. Domestic equities accounted for only 4 percent of the portfolio.Yale did not release performance results by category for a single year. Rather it releases results for the 10-year period.It said on Thursday that its best-performing sector in terms of average annualized returns for that period was venture capital at 18 percent, followed by foreign equities at 17.4 percent and leveraged buyouts at 13.8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Cautions on Concentrated Positions in U.S. Mutual Funds", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe warning comes at a time of increased nervousness about China and other emerging markets like Brazil. And it highlights a growing concern on the part of regulators and economists that mutual funds, in their hunger to load up on high-risk, high-yield securities in an environment of low interest rates, will be hard pressed to sell them during a market reversal.Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates fund companies, proposed a series of rules and regulations intended to bolster the practices of mutual and exchange-traded funds when it comes to returning cash to investors.The reports were part of a broader research overview that the I.M.F. was presenting ahead of its fall meetings, which are to be held in Lima, Peru, starting next week.In particular, the I.M.F. said that the bountiful amounts of cash that have moved around the marketplace in this era of extraordinary central bank activism had given many investors a false sense of security in terms of their ability to sell assets on demand.\u201cEven seemingly plentiful market liquidity can suddenly evaporate and lead to systemic financial disruptions,\u201d the authors of the report concluded.Most large investment banks no longer actively trade these securities, increasing the danger that a contagious bout of selling could spread through the financial marketplace, the fund\u2019s economists noted.Although the language of the fund\u2019s experts was muted, their words of caution highlight increased investor unease about the slowdown in China and other large emerging markets.Underpinning the I.M.F.\u2019s worries has been the tremendous increase in bonds issued by a range of large emerging market corporations, including energy firms in Latin America and steel companies in Southeast Asia.Two countries that have been at the center of investor concerns \u2014 China and Turkey \u2014 were highlighted in the fund\u2019s study on emerging-market debts. These two economies experienced the largest increases in corporate debt since 2007, with China company debt up 27 percent and Turkey up around 24 percent.Corporate debt in emerging markets has soared to $18 trillion in 2014 from $4 trillion in 2004. Bonds issued in dollars have been the fastest-growing subsection of this category, increasing to $855 billion last year from $163 billion in 2003, the I.M.F. calculates.Mutual funds in the United States have been the most aggressive buyers of these securities, and the fear is that, as these economies slow and their currencies tumble, the companies will default and it will be the American mutual fund investor who will be left with the bill.Although the I.M.F. and other international watchdogs such as the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for global central banks, have been highlighting this concern for some time, there has been little evidence to date of mutual funds being unable to sell their bonds when asked to do so by investors.And mutual fund companies have vigorously defended their policies in terms of providing liquidity to investors. Many fund companies have taken extra precautions such as arranging for credit lines from banks and increasing levels of cash or securities that are easy to sell.But analysts who keep a close eye on how easy \u2014 or hard \u2014 it is to sell bonds in the market these days say that these steps may not be enough, especially if, as is often the case in a market panic, investors head for the exits in unison.\u201cThere have been a lot of people going into these types of illiquid investments,\u201d said Stephen Tu, an expert on market liquidity at the credit rating firm Moody\u2019s. \u201cIf we have a real liquidation event, solutions such as credit lines are going to be inadequate.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about an International Monetary Fund report on risks in mutual fund holdings of high-yielding bonds described incorrectly the outflow from mutual funds this year. Investors in the United States and worldwide have pulled close to $75 billion, not $100 billion, from global bond and equity funds that invest in emerging markets, not funds more broadly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Sell-Off Extends to Asia, but Glencore Edges Higher", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFears about commodity prices and an oversupply of raw materials have been reflecting broader weaknesses in global growth, said Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. Glencore, which owns mines but also actively trades commodities, has been hit doubly hard lately.Glencore\u2019s stock had plunged nearly 30 percent on Monday in European trading. And that selling continued on Tuesday, with its Hong Kong-listed shares falling 29 percent.That is why Glencore\u2019s shares were being closely watched on Tuesday in London.Glencore has taken the worst beating of the major mining stocks in recent months, in the face of plunging commodity prices and worries about the economy of China, which has been the major global customer for iron ore and other metals. The company\u2019s stock price has fallen about 80 percent over the past year.\u201cWe believe the market response is overdone,\u201d Heath Jansen, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients on Monday about Glencore. Mr. Jansen also said that Glencore\u2019s management should consider taking the company private if the stock market \u201ccontinues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly.\u201dBut some analysts worry that if prices of commodities like coal and copper fall further, Glencore may struggle to service its debt.Hunter Hillcoat, an analyst at Investec in London, estimates that Glencore has about $47 billion in debt, dwarfing its stock market value of about $16 billion. \u201cThe market is becoming increasingly concerned about the company\u2019s being able to refinance and roll over corporate bond debt,\u201d Mr. Hillcoat said in an interview.The company raised $2.5 billion recently at a price of 1.25 pounds a share, with the chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, and other employees buying 22 percent. But the stock has since fallen about 40 percent since then.In Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan closed 4 percent lower, and the benchmark Shanghai index closed down about 2 percent. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down 2.97 percent, and the main index in Australia closed down 3.8 percent.Australia is exposed more than many other countries to the weaknesses in commodity prices. There are signs that other parts of its economy are doing better, but \u201ccommodity trumps everything,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.India\u2019s central bank cut rates more than expected on Tuesday, citing a weak economic outlook. It brought its benchmark interest rate down by 0.5 percentage point, rather than the expected 0.25, to 6.75 percent.All this showed that central banks were not confident that global growth would snap back anytime soon, Mr. Neumann said.An earlier version of this article misstated how much Glencore\u2019s stock has fallen since the company raised $2.5 billion. It is 40 percent, not 57 percent.Stanley Reed reported from London, and Amie Tsang from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Shkreli is either the boy genius or the bad boy of pharmaceuticals, depending on one\u2019s point of view.Mr. Shkreli, the boyish-looking 32-year-old founder of two drug companies, has proved to have a sharp eye for finding obscure drugs that might be turned into lucrative moneymakers, rewarding some of his investors.But after years of attacking drug company executives, he was vilified on social media and became the symbol for price gouging after his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of a 62-year-old drug it had acquired to $750 a pill from $13.50.After fiercely defending the price increase in various interviews and on Twitter for two days, Mr. Shkreli backed down a bit late Tuesday. He told television news networks that the price of the drug, Daraprim, would be lowered, though he did not specify what the new price would be.This is not the first time that Mr. Shkreli, a former hedge fund manager with a reputation for outspokenness, has been at the center of a controversy.While in his 20s, he drew negative attention for urging the Food and Drug Administration not to approve drugs made by companies whose stock he was selling short.He was among a group of investors ordered by a New York judge to pay $2.3 million to Lehman Brothers to cover a losing bet on the markets in 2007.Two former employees sued him for not paying their wages, while another former employee accused Mr. Shkreli of taking over his personal email and Facebook accounts and harassing his family through social media.The board of his first pharmaceutical company accused him of using the company as his personal piggy bank to pay back angry investors in his hedge fund.An affidavit from Timothy Pierotti, who once worked for Martin Shkreli.While controversial, Mr. Shkreli is also charismatic and whip smart, according to those who know him, able to talk science without having any formal training.\u201cYou give him a science textbook on chemistry, he\u2019d give it back to you in nine months and he\u2019d have it memorized,\u201d said one early investor in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s first drug company, Retrophin. \u201cHe\u2019s a sponge for information.\u201dMr. Shkreli has also continued to bet against, or short, biotechnology stocks, even as he has run Retrophin and Turing. He is said to have made millions shorting the stocks of Celladon and Vital Therapies after correctly predicting their products would fail in clinical trials.But this investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to retain relations in the industry, added, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody there in Martin\u2019s life to tell him what the right thing is.\u201dRaised in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, the child of immigrants from Albania and Croatia, Mr. Shkreli hit Wall Street at the age of 17.While attending Baruch College, Mr. Shkreli started working as a clerk at a hedge fund, Cramer, Berkowitz & Company, in 2000. (Jim Cramer, the hedge fund manager and host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d retired from his namesake firm that same year.) At one point, Mr. Shkreli recommended the fund short the stock of a biotechnology company, according to an interview last year with Bloomberg Businessweek. The stock fell and the hedge fund made money, prompting an inquiry from regulators about the fund\u2019s well-timed bet. Regulators ultimately found no wrongdoing.Mr. Shkreli set off to start his own hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in about 2006, but it soon ran into trouble. In July 2007, Elea, Mr. Shkreli and others were sued by Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers for failing to pay for a put option, essentially a bet that the market would fall. When the stock market instead climbed, the fund didn\u2019t pay. A judge issued a $2.3 million default judgment against Mr. Shkreli and the fund.Still, the hiccup did not slow Mr. Shkreli down. He soon started a new hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, using his initials and those of his business partner, Marek Biestek. At MSMB, a fund focused on health care, Mr. Shkreli once again plied his trade in short-selling. But rather than simply sell short a company\u2019s shares and hope that eventually the stock would fall, Mr. Shkreli actively campaigned to make things difficult for the drug companies.In 2011, Mr. Shkreli decided to enter the pharmaceutical industry, raising money from MSMB investors to start Retrophin.The company looked for older, somewhat obscure drugs that it could acquire and turn into so-called specialty drugs for rare diseases, with substantially higher prices. Retrophin now sells three drugs, and total sales reached $24.1 million in the second quarter of this year.Mr. Shkreli had terminated the manager, Timothy Pierotti, and accused him in a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court of buying shares in a company for his own account that netted $3 million in profits that should have been for the fund. In an affidavit, Mr. Pierotti said his Facebook, LinkedIn and personal email accounts had been taken over.The company filed a lawsuit alleging its former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, had breached his duty of loyalty to the company.Mr. Pierotti also accused Mr. Shkreli of sending messages via social media to his wife and his 16-year-old son. When his son asked why Mr. Shkreli had sent him a Facebook friend request, Mr. Shkreli responded, \u201cbecause I want you to know about your dad ... he betrayed me. He stole $3 million from me.\u201dThe lawsuit was discontinued by both sides a few months later. Mr. Pierotti could not be reached for comment.The board of Retrophin fired Mr. Shkreli a year ago. In August Retrophin filed a federal lawsuit in New York accusing its former chief executive of breaching his duty of loyalty to the company. It accused Mr. Shkreli of arranging to pay off some angry investors in his hedge fund by having Retrophin enter into consulting agreements with them.In court filings, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers asked for an extension in time to respond to the suit. Retrophin has disclosed in regulatory filings that it is cooperating with a federal criminal investigation involving Mr. Shkreli and investors in his previous funds.After being fired from Retrophin, Mr. Shkreli founded Turing, bringing with him many employees and investors from his former company.\u201cAfter being kicked out of my own company, I\u2019ve built a bigger and better one,\u201d he said in an interview last week. He said the lawsuit against him by Retrophin was \u201ca sad attempt to avoid paying a very large severance amount\u201d that he said Retrophin owed him.Turing announced in August that it had raised $90 million in equity and debt from investors, led by Mr. Shkreli.An early Retrophin investor, who saw the prospectus for the Turing offering, said it outlined Turing\u2019s plan to acquire Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug used to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can be life-threatening to some babies and people with AIDS and cancer.As an old drug, Daraprim has no patent protection, but until now sales have been so small that no generic companies have been interested in making it.Turing paid $55 million to acquire the drug from Impax Laboratories, a deal that made sense only if Turing planned to raise the price of the drug substantially.A condition of the deal, according to this potential investor, was that Impax remove the drug from regular wholesalers and drugstores, which would make it harder for generic companies to obtain samples needed to develop generic copies. In June, two months before the sale to Turing was announced, Impax switched to tightly controlled distribution.Once Turing obtained the drug, it quickly raised the price to $750 a tablet from $13.50, drawing protests from infectious disease doctors that ignited the firestorm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY Illustrations by Rob DobiMore than 200 years after winning a revolution and building a powerful nation, the U.S. founding fathers continue to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. But one is touching lives even more directly \u2014 thanks to his financial savvy rather than his politics.Benjamin Franklin \u2014 the founder, statesman and philosopher immortalized for his inventions, diplomacy and experiments with electricity \u2014 established two small investments in his will that are still funding the educations of 21st-century students. More than 225 years after his death, those investments continue to provide a valuable lesson for today\u2019s investors.This lesser-known Franklin story builds on the simple advice about savings and thriftiness that he offered as a printer and the author of \u201cPoor Richard\u2019s Almanack.\u201d It\u2019s a story that illuminates his deep understanding of the power of compounding \u2014 an investment strategy of reinvesting interest and other gains over time.His foresight stemmed from a connection with money throughout his life. While he lacked it growing up, he became a successful printer of currency and accumulated enough wealth to retire early. That opened other opportunities in science, politics and statesmanship. He even played a pivotal role in obtaining financing from France for the Revolutionary War.Franklin expanded his printing business beyond newspapers to money. \u201cThe printing of currency coincided with his interest in many disciplines,\u201d Talbott says. With his friend, Joseph Breintnall, they created a specialized way to print that hindered counterfeiters.This innovation contributed to Franklin\u2019s financial success. It allowed him to get currency printing jobs in many of the colonies, essentially creating franchises.Franklin felt very strongly that if you had sufficient wealth, you should retire and devote yourself to the public good, Wood says.Toward the end of his life, Franklin wanted to give back to Boston and Philadelphia, the cities that he called home, and to those who looked up to him \u2014 the apprentices and tradesmiths of America. When he died April 16, 1790, he left 1,000 pounds sterling (roughly $4,500 at the time) to each city \u2014 but that money came with one big stipulation.Each sum had to be placed in a trust and invested for 100 years, after which around 75 percent could be used to help tradesmen and fund civic projects. The rest was to be invested for another 100 years, at which time it would be given in full to the cities.After the first 100 years, thanks to compounding interest, the trusts in Boston and Philadelphia were worth almost $400,000 and $100,000, respectively, prior to any disbursements. (The amounts differed due to each city\u2019s financial strategies and investment paths.) By 1990, the remaining amounts had grown to $4.5 million for Boston and $2 million for Philadelphia, as a result of compounding. Twenty-five years later, a fraction of that money still remains, which is used to continue Franklin\u2019s wishes.While the gift has provided for many students in Boston and Philadelphia, Anthony Benoit, president of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, understands that it won\u2019t last forever.\u201cWhat we really count on now is current-day Franklins \u2014 the other people who have worked hard and have invested in ways that allow them to be generous to the next generation.\u201dA modern-day Benjamin Franklin isn\u2019t necessarily an innovator and statesman. People can follow in his footsteps simply by investing for what\u2019s next \u2014 whether it\u2019s for a personal goal or the well-being of future generations.In fact, many modern investors can take advantage of the same strategy that paid off for Franklin: compounding. The strategy is as simple as reinvesting the interest, dividends and other gains delivered by your principal investment.Click on the arrows to explore the scenarios.Without interest on the money, the amount would remain the same, although its purchasing power would\u2019ve been reduced because of inflation.Without any interest on the money, the amount would remain the same, although its purchasing power would have been reduced because of inflation.All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.The money left in Franklin\u2019s will had 200 years to grow. It stayed invested. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect of interest on top of interest, plus principal, that gives you the compound returns,\u201d says O\u2019Lear.Today, investors also have the added benefit of asset allocation, or putting your money into a mix of different asset classes, such as equity or fixed income. This mix helps investors reduce risk when the market is in flux while still offering the potential for earning returns.\u201cAsset allocation allows you to have some of your money invested in the top performers while also ensuring you don't have all your money in the worst performers,\u201d says O\u2019Lear. Or to put it more simply: \u201cYou\u2019re not putting all your eggs in one basket.\u201d\u201cIt may make you feel more comfortable about remaining invested, which allows you to take full advantage of compounding, because if you are invested and staying with it, your investments and your patience can work to your benefit,\u201d he says.O\u2019Lear says that the lessons from Franklin can easily be applied today when it comes to investing practices. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling when you see how compounding can work for you.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Crowdfunding a $500 Million Ferris Wheel, With a Wall Street Spin", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvesting in stocks is at times compared to a thrill ride \u2014 a rocket ship taking off, or a roller coaster rushing down.The comparison may be more apt than usual for a new investment \u2014 a 630-foot Ferris wheel under construction on Staten Island \u2014 that soon will be marketed via a Wall Street version of crowdfunding.Project leaders of the New York Wheel, which has already raised around $450 million in equity and debt, plan to seek another $30 million through North Capital Private Securities, a Utah broker-dealer that intends to sell some of the new shares via its 99Funding online crowdfunding platform and other crowdfunding sites.Crowdfunding on websites like Kickstarter has allowed people and organizations to raise money for various projects from supporters who don\u2019t have any formal economic interest in the ventures.Numerous online venues, often in partnership with smaller and midsize securities firms such as North Capital, have adopted provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, which loosened restrictions on stock sales by business start-ups.Jim Dowd, founder and chief executive of North Capital, said he believed that the $500 million New York Wheel project \u201cis going to be the largest transaction we\u2019re aware of that has crowdfunding.\u201dThe sale of these new shares is possible under a JOBS Act provision that went into effect in 2013, allowing private stock sales to \u201caccredited\u201d wealthy investors who meet certain income or net-worth tests.While some of the shares will be sold conventionally by brokers, Mr. Dowd said, other shares will be sold through 99Funding to \u201cself-directed investors,\u201d those who sign up on their own. He said the offering was planned for a 90-day period before the year\u2019s end.The New York Wheel was originally backed by a group of wealthy investors including the real estate moguls Jeffrey Feil and Lloyd Goldman and the Jordache jeans magnate Joseph Nakash, according to Rich Marin, the project\u2019s chief executive. A sprawling outlet mall is also planned nearby.Mr. Marin and Mr. Dowd are longtime business associates who both previously worked at Bear Stearns and Bankers Trust. North Capital plans to add up to a dozen other crowdfunding sites to participate in the fund-raising, and expects to set a minimum investment size of $5,000 to $10,000, Mr. Dowd added.Construction on the wheel began in May, after the project raised $195 million in senior debt from the Highbridge Capital Management hedge fund unit of JPMorgan Chase, and $150 million in additional debt from CanAm Enterprises, under an American program that allows foreign nationals \u2014 CanAm investors, in this case \u2014 to gain legal residency in the United States by making job-creating investments. Another $24 million is due next month from the CanAm investors.One sign of risk associated with the project is that the Highbridge debt carries an interest rate of 10.25 percent. But the CanAm interest rate is just 2.75 percent.An earlier effort at selling stock to round out financing for the wheel \u2014 which began last fall by another securities firm, Houlihan Lokey \u2014 raised $31 million, falling about $15 million short of its target, Mr. Marin said. The project\u2019s original backers invested about $80 million, he added. The Houlihan sale was cut short by the New York Wheel project leaders, who needed to close other components of the financing \u2014 curtailing Houlihan\u2019s time to try to raise the remaining funds.The ability of start-ups to raise money via crowdfunding is expected to expand further once securities regulators complete the rules under another part of the JOBS Act that will allow businesses to raise funds from accredited and unaccredited investors.Dara Albright, a crowd-finance expert who co-founded the LendIt and FinFair conferences on alternative finance, cautions investors not to lose sight of the inherent risks in such ventures, especially since these investors don\u2019t typically get the same amount of information about sales, profits and other business metrics that public companies are required to disclose. \u201cThese things are risky,\u201d she said.videoAdvertisement"}

I didn\u2019t see any silverware in this announcement, and I think October is off the table.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they are in much of a hurry,\u201d he added. \u201cThe international situation must have generated a real re-evaluation.\u201dStill, other experts argued that the central bank is prepared to move as soon as global conditions improve, illustrating the uncertainty that will persist until at least the next Fed meeting in late October \u2014 or more likely until the last gathering of the year for policy makers in mid-December.\u201cThe global deterioration has caught their attention and, clearly, that was the main factor,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will keep them on hold for an extended period of time. Both the meetings in October and December remain live.\u201dIndeed, traders on Wall Street could not make up their minds Thursday on how to greet the Fed decision not to enact its first rate increase since 2006. After initially dropping after the 2 p.m. announcement, stocks quickly rallied by more than 1 percent, only to fall in the final hour of trading. Major market indexes finished the day down by about 0.25 percent.Several analysts said they were struck by the second paragraph in the Fed\u2019s statement, in particular the conclusion that global volatility and economic events \u201care likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\u201dIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said those conclusions constituted the major news in Thursday\u2019s announcement.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised they didn\u2019t move, but I am slightly surprised that they were so explicit with their reasoning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new stuff is the recent financial global developments, and for now they are kind of paralyzed.\u201dMr. Shepherdson said he expected the United States economy to continue to strengthen in the months ahead while volatility lessens in China and other markets, prompting the central bank to finally start tightening in December.What is important to understand, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, is that the Fed has concluded inflation will remain depressed, even if the other economic fallout from problems abroad is minimal.\u201cThat\u2019s significant,\u201d said Mr. Gapen, who is an outlier on Wall Street in predicting that the Fed will wait until March 2016 to move. \u201cWhether or not the risk materializes, they think it will suppress inflation, and that means they can let labor markets go a little longer without an increase.\u201dWith wage gains still scarce for most workers, and many having trouble finding full-time positions despite a 5.1 percent unemployment rate that would normally signal employers to raise pay, labor unions and liberal economists hailed the Fed\u2019s move as a sign policy makers see continuing slack in the labor market as much more of a threat than inflation.\u201cWe are pleased that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged,\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cWe know the economic recovery still has not reached working families, and even a small increase can have devastating effects on our economic stability.\u201dJared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said he believes that Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, is focused on how uneven the recovery in the labor market has been.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like an economy that needs a brake tap,\u201d he said, adding that Ms. Yellen \u201chas been consistently, and thankfully, mindful of the absence of full employment despite the 5.1 percent unemployment rate.\u201dWith the dollar strengthening by more than 15 percent over the last 12 months against other currencies, making imports into the United States cheaper, economic forces are quietly combating inflation through another channel, Mr. Bernstein noted.\u201cThe appreciation of the dollar has been doing the Fed\u2019s work many times over,\u201d he said. Many observers expect the dollar to continue to rise against other currencies, because of economic weakness in Asia and the relative strength of the American economy.On the other end of the political spectrum, conservative economists and Republicans on Capitol Hill expressed worry that the longer the Fed waits to make its inevitable move to raise interest rates, the greater the threat that investors will get cold feet.Thursday\u2019s decision \u201chas less to do with the underlying weakness of the economy than the timidity of the Fed to take the first necessary step to normalize monetary policy,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cAs long as the Fed remains fearful to act lest it be blamed for any economic hiccup, market uncertainty will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Buying and holding high-quality bonds may seem less rewarding, but it could protect retirees from gyrations when a big loss of principal would be devastating.Now one of America\u2019s biggest pension funds is considering whether to apply that principle to its giant portfolio, as record numbers of its members are reaching retirement age and drawing their benefits.The board of the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, known as Calstrs, is discussing whether it would be best to shift as much as $20 billion of its portfolio out of stocks and even out of some fixed-income positions, in favor of something new, a \u201crisk mitigation strategy.\u201dMany corporate pension funds have adopted some form of risk mitigation, but the approach is seldom seen among public pension funds.The discussion took place against the backdrop of a profound demographic shift in Calstrs. The number of California teachers who are drawing their benefits has been rising every year, and they are enjoying longer, healthier life spans than actuaries predicted in the past. Not surprisingly, the payouts to the retirees have grown every year as well. The average payment to a retiree last year was $44,328, while in 2005 it was $31,404.The problem is that annual contributions to the pension fund, from the state and its many school districts, have stayed more or less flat.The employees of Calstrs said that they would continue with modeling and that the trustees did not have to make a decision until the end of the year.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s stock price tripled in six months.That a financial company as embedded in the Communist Party elite as Citic Securities has fallen on hard times highlights the uncertainty in Chinese stock markets, the broader economy and the political climate in Beijing.In this environment, the usual rules don\u2019t seem to apply, putting financial stalwarts like Citic Securities on shaky ground.Even the company\u2019s political connections have not provided protection. The Georgetown-educated chairman of Citic Securities, Wang Dongming, is the son of a former Chinese diplomat. The father of Liu Lefei, a vice chairman, is the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda chief and a member of the ruling seven-member Politburo Standing Committee.Citic Securities also finds itself fending off rumors on Chinese websites and on social media. Shares of the company are off by almost two-thirds since peaking in late April.As with much involving the Chinese government, a lack of information is making it difficult to discern exactly what is happening.Citic Securities is an important member of the government-controlled \u201cnational team\u201d that carries out the will of the state in financial markets. With the government now trying to prop up the markets, big brokerage firms like Citic Securities are tasked with buying stocks to help stabilize shares.Which stocks brokerages are buying and how those purchases are managed is veiled in secrecy. But some experts on China\u2019s financial system worry that such information could be leaking out, giving some investors an unfair advantage.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a dreadful situation that the Chinese government\u2019s put themselves in, because there are clearly people in the know about what the government\u2019s intentions are, what it\u2019s buying,\u201d said Fraser J.\u00a0T.

In the last five years, the brokerage firm has raised more than $30 billion for companies in China, including for marquee players like the state-owned nuclear power company, according to data from Bloomberg.Citic Securities is also the biggest shareholder in the Citic Private Equity Fund Management Company, one of the biggest private equity firms in China, whose chairman is Mr. Liu, the son of the propaganda chief. The company has made early investments in big businesses that later had successful initial public offerings, like the New China Life Insurance Company in 2011.The chairman of Citic Securities, Mr. Wang, has been cited in the Chinese news media as saying he wants his company to become known as the Goldman Sachs of China.But the official inquiry into Citic Securities shows that there are limits to political connections in China, especially as industries such as finance become more professional and competitive, said Mr. Liu of the Lujiazui Institute.He points to the declining market share of the China International Capital Corporation, the country\u2019s first investment bank, which until October was headed by the son of a former premier.

{"Headline": "Philip Falcone, Former Head of Vast Fund, Tries a 3rd Act", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhilip A. Falcone, the brash hedge fund titan who once managed $26 billion before stumbling and running afoul of regulators, is pressing ahead on a new comeback effort, his second.His latest investment platform is a publicly traded company with $800 million in assets called HC2 Holdings. It has bought a couple of midsize businesses \u2014 an undersea cable installer and a steel fabricator \u2014 that are intended to generate cash to help support several smaller growth prospects that include operations in wireless services, natural-gas truck-fueling stations, life sciences, insurance and sports.For Mr. Falcone, the goal is to make smart acquisitions and hit home runs with some of the smaller earlier-stage ventures, much as he once did by buying bonds of companies in financial distress.The new venture also allows him to stay active during a regulatory ban that bars him from the securities and investment advisory businesses until 2018; regulators have allowed him to run a public company that buys whole businesses instead of managing a fund trading stocks and bonds.In an interview, Mr. Falcone said he was aiming to \u201cgo out and acquire companies and build on that,\u201d creating value through growth in diverse industries.\u201cI feel like, not that I have a lot to prove, but I look at this vehicle as \u2018success is the best revenge,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he added.Charles Frischer, a private investor in Seattle whose family owns 1.7 million shares, or 6.5 percent, of HC2, said Mr. Falcone would be \u201ccompletely redeemed\u201d if he could build HC2\u2019s assets to $2 billion or $3 billion.But Mr. Falcone faces hurdles at HC2, which has been hampered by his history and has already encountered a few setbacks. After quadrupling in price based on its debt-financed acquisitions, its stock has fallen by 40 percent this summer amid sales by a large investor. And a $195 million takeover bid that could have doubled HC2\u2019s size was rejected recently.And the results at his first comeback, a larger public-company vehicle he started six years ago, were underwhelming.Still, Mr. Falcone is undeterred.\u201cPeople kind of look at me as I am unbelievably aggressive, and I probably do make some people nervous,\u201d Mr. Falcone, a former Harvard hockey center, said in a large conference room in his Park Avenue office for which he pays part of the rent because HC2 alone is not big enough to afford it.Explaining his motivation, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a competitor. I think I\u2019m an unbelievable competitor.\u201d He added, \u201cAs the youngest of nine kids in a three-bedroom house, I learned how not to give up.\u201dMr. Falcone, 53, has already known triumph and adversity on a large scale.After a decade as a high-yield bond trader on Wall Street, he began the Harbinger Capital hedge fund in 2001, initially focusing on distressed debt. In 2007, he personally earned $1.7 billion and doubled his investors\u2019 money on a winning bet against subprime mortgages.He also indulged in a real estate spending spree, paying $49 million for a 27-room Manhattan townhouse once owned by the Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione and $39 million for a mountainside Caribbean villa in St. Barts.But in 2008, he got caught in the market downdraft with too many illiquid positions just as he faced $10 billion in redemption demands from his investors. Those demands forced him to block investor exits, even as he took a $113 million loan in 2009 to pay his own taxes while he was also buying out a co-founding partner for about $100 million.While Harbinger documents gave him the right to obtain the loan, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in 2013 that he did not form a required fairness committee, did not pay the same rate as Harbinger was paying to borrow and did not disclose the loan to investors for five months.The cloud of the S.E.C. inquiry, which began in 2010, coupled with losses in 2010 and 2011, eventually doomed the hedge fund. Still two-fifths owned by Mr. Falcone, it retains a few illiquid holdings, chiefly a 48 percent stake in LightSquared, a wireless spectrum owner potentially worth billions, and a hotel-casino-golf resort in Vietnam.With Mr. Falcone as chief executive, HRG grew to a market value of $2.7 billion with debt of $1.4 billion, partly by issuing new shares in exchange for assets from the hedge fund. For example, it acquired a majority stake in Spectrum Brands, which sells Black & Decker appliances and George Foreman grills.In early 2014, HRG invested about $20 million for a 40 percent stake in HC2 as a new but smaller Falcone acquisition platform with a broader mandate that gave him more autonomy. Mr. Falcone said HRG directors \u201chad lived through the issues with the S.E.C. and I think it created a little bit of tension and uneasiness with the board.\u201d In order to expand HRG in the wider way he envisions for HC2, \u201cI really would have had to push and battle.\u201dSo Mr. Falcone turned his focus to HC2. Last November, he stepped down as HRG\u2019s chief executive, reaping a $40 million exit payout. During his tenure, HRG stock\u2019s price gain of 78 percent trailed broader market averages. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, for example, gained 135 percent over the same period.HC2 is now the stage for Falcone comeback No. 2.Last year, the company paid $260 million for Global Marine Systems, an undersea cable installer, and $85 million for the Schuff International steel fabrication business. \u201cWe probably started off a little bit slow,\u201d Mr. Falcone told investors in August, referring to American Natural Gas. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make a big push in that area over the next six to 12 months.\u201dBut the risks can be seen in the steep 11 percent interest rate that HC2 is paying on its $300 million in junk-bond debt, and in its roller coaster stock action.Earlier this year, with HC2 stock still rising, Mr. Falcone sought to buy MCG Capital \u2014 a middle-market commercial finance company whose cash assets could have doubled HC2\u2019s size \u2014 in a bid of mostly stock. MCG, however, spurned Mr. Falcone, choosing another suitor and raising the prospect of potential regulatory hurdles because of the S.E.C. case against him.Just then, with the takeover battle in full swing, HRG signaled that it had begun selling HC2 shares, sending the stock price sharply lower and cutting the value of the bid for MCG. As the stock fell, Mr. Falcone said the question arose why he wasn\u2019t buying. On Aug. 14, MCG holders decisively rejected the Falcone bid.Although Mr. Falcone had been blocked from buying HC2 shares just then by a pre-earnings trading blackout, the issue of his HC2 stock ownership remains valid. Most of his holdings are in options, which he can earn under a performance formula tied to bolstering the company\u2019s net-asset value.While the latest HC2 proxy lists him as owning 2.4 million shares for an 8.9 percent stake, most of that count represents options he has not exercised. As of April 15, he owned only 565,951 shares outright, currently worth just $4.2 million.That means Mr. Falcone gains more if the stock rises than he loses if it drops. Trying to build HC2 quickly to reap such rewards could heighten the risk for other investors. But Mr. Frischer, the Seattle investor, said the upside from HC2\u2019s speculative holdings \u201ccould be very high.\u201dExplaining his small stake in HC2, Mr. Falcone said his money \u201cis tied up,\u201d with about one-third in his personal real estate holdings \u2014 estimated to be worth a few hundred million dollars \u2014 and much of the rest in his remaining stakes in the hedge fund and HRG. As a concession to his shrunken empire, this year he sold his minority stake in the Minnesota Wild professional hockey team.Mr. Falcone insists he is not going to rush things at HC2, calling the recent stock-price decline \u201ca blip.\u201d\u201cFrom a logic perspective, I have to take my time, I can\u2019t be flippant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to build value between now and 10 years from now. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Lays Out 5-Year Plan for Restructuring Its Debts", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrying to balance the demands of anxious island residents on one side and powerful financial institutions on the other, the governor of Puerto Rico announced a plan Wednesday for bailing the island out of debt that would require at least five years of bruising reform if it is to succeed.In a speech live on television and online, the governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, stepped up his populist talk, seeming to take the side of residents against investors, who would face losses on their Puerto Rico bonds if the plan goes into effect. \u201cWe may be publicly attacked by outside interests who will want to force us to pay,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said. \u201cThey will attack us, because they\u2019ll want to see us on our knees.\u201dBut even as the governor sought to buoy the spirits of his fellow Puerto Ricans, who face what many say will be painful cutbacks in services under the plan, he also sought to show the island\u2019s many creditors that they would be better off working with him than fighting his proposals.\u201cIf creditors are not willing to take part in this process, Puerto Rico will have no choice but to go ahead without them,\u201d he said, adding that his preference was to get the creditors on board. Unilateral action, he said, \u201cwill result in years of litigation and defaults, and a major humanitarian crisis. It will force us to choose between paying a creditor, a teacher, a policeman or a nurse. \u201cThese are decisions I\u2019d prefer not to make, but I will make them if I have to,\u201d he said.The plan also calls for an ambitious package of economic reforms enabling the island to deliver public services and collect taxes more efficiently, stimulate business investment and job creation, and carry out long-overdue maintenance on roads, ports and bridges. It also proposes steps that include raising the tuition at the University of Puerto Rico, seeking a waiver from increases in the federal minimum wage, updating the government\u2019s software to better track expenses, cutting health care costs, and contracting for-profit companies to run government properties, like roads and ports.But virtually every element of the plan requires either concessions negotiated from creditors or legislation enacted in San Juan or Washington, suggesting a long and difficult road ahead.While there was little public reaction to the plan from either side, institutional bond holders were said to be huddling in the wake of the speech, trying to decide their best course of action. Some people involved in those talks, who declined to be identified, said they thought the creditors would fare better if they stuck together, even though they include a wide range of individuals and institutions with divergent interests, from hedge funds to bond insurers to retired Puerto Ricans living on the island.\u201cEverybody\u2019s still assessing and trying to figure out ways where they could take a stand,\u201d one person said. \u201cIn a way, creditors can see they\u2019re kind of being set up.\u201dPuerto Rico might see an advantage in pitting the creditors against one another, the person said, so they would fight over which debts have priority instead of fighting head-on with Puerto Rico. The creditors\u2019 interests can be in conflict, depending on the type of bonds they hold.\u201cWe\u2019re better off if we band together, and the trick will be overcoming those differences,\u201d that person said.The five-year plan calls for restructuring about $47 billion of Puerto Rico\u2019s $72 billion in bond debt and carrying out economic overhauls under an independent financial control board.However, Ted Hampton, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, was less than optimistic about cooperation among the creditors. \u201cThere is a high probability of protracted litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unlikely that holders of the many Puerto Rico bonds will agree to forgo, or defer, substantial sums of promised principal and interest.\u201dAmong the most striking aspects of the plan \u2014 and likely to be one of the most contentious \u2014 is the proposal to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds, which were sold to investors with an explicit constitutional promise that timely repayment would take priority over all other expenditures on the island.Puerto Rico stunned investors this summer by defaulting on another type of bond, but failing to pay general obligation debt when it is due is almost unheard-of.For decades, general obligation bonds have been marketed as virtually default-proof, and a major restructuring of them now by Puerto Rico would raise unwelcome questions about the credibility of the time-honored \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d pledge that stands behind such bonds. Puerto Rico is not proposing to walk away from its bonds completely, but to pay its investors less.Doing that could put its new economic plan at odds with its Constitution, but officials said there was no choice: If Puerto Rico continued to pay its bondholders on schedule, it will run out of cash by next summer, according to official projections.The plan offers an analysis showing that Puerto Rico has already preserved some of its cash by taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d like delaying residents\u2019 income tax refunds and liquidating the assets of three social-insurance funds. But even maneuvers like that cannot keep Puerto Rico afloat indefinitely, and the analysis showed that by next June, Puerto Rico\u2019s cash would be completely exhausted.A photographer and writer return to the island to find both resentment and resilience among the middle class.The island has had such cash squeezes in the past, and it responded by simply borrowing more money, which is how it accumulated such a huge load of debt. Now, though, it has effectively lost its ability to borrow, and if it burns through its cash by next June, it will be unable to pay for essential public services \u2014 like policing and public education \u2014 that its Constitution also requires it to provide to residents of the island, who are United States citizens.The island has been seeking support from Congress for a change in the federal bankruptcy code, which now specifies that no part of the Puerto Rican government has standing to seek relief in the federal bankruptcy courts. Puerto Rico has been pushing for some form of access to bankruptcy, but opinions differ about which parts of the government should qualify. In any case, the bills introduced so far have not moved.Members of the working group that devised the five-year plan said the lack of a legal framework would make its restructuring uniquely difficult.To make sure the plan stays on track, it calls for establishing a financial control board. Such boards have been used in many parts of the United States to improve the governance of distressed cities, counties and school districts; they can sometimes impose unpopular fiscal measures that elected officials cannot.The structures and powers of financial control boards can vary widely. Puerto Rico\u2019s planners said they envisioned a five-member board of independent financial experts from the island and elsewhere.

{"Headline": "Investing in Watches: Is It Worth the Risk?", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA vintage timepiece can be a blend of historic artifact and status symbol. But for buyers who choose wisely \u2014 something often hard to do \u2014 it also can be a sound financial investment. At auctions, \u201cfocus had been on contemporary watches, but tastes have changed and there is recognition that vintage watches are more collectable,\u201d said Thomas Perazzi, head of Christie\u2019s watch department in Geneva. \u201cWe have seen a huge increment in interest from mainland China and the Middle East.\u201d There also are indications that valuations will continue to rise. According to Knight Frank\u2019s 2014 Luxury Investment Index, watches are expected to appreciate 68 percent over 10 years. (The greatest growth, however, is projected for classic cars, at 487 percent.)But for Mr. Perazzi, treating an old watch purely as an investment is anything but straightforward. \u201cIt\u2019s always extremely difficult to invest in watches,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we have many examples for watches that have increased in value enormously \u2014 it\u2019s a delicate issue that requires expertise.\u201dSticking to well-known brands is one strategy for buyers with an eye to resale value. Steven Kivel of Central Watch, a mechanical watch service and restoration company in New York, said, \u201cFor me, Patek Philippe and Rolex are the two watches that stand out in terms of investing, they\u2019re like buying stocks in Apple or Microsoft.\u201d\u201cThe biggest mistake people make is focusing on obscure brands,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not great odds unless you\u2019re really in tune to exactly what the hot brands are.\u201d\u201cThe likes of vintage Rolexes, Cartiers and Patek Philippes have become almost impossible except for the wealthy,\u201d he added. \u201cNow if you want a blue-chip brand and you want vintage, you are going to pay for it.\u201d A 1,500 percent return on investment \u2014 like Christie\u2019s achieved with the 1949 Rolex \u2014 is certainly not the norm and usually applies to rare historic models from a handful brands, Mr. Forster said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to look off the beaten track \u2014 and you really don\u2019t have to look that far \u2014 you can find really wonderful watches that aren\u2019t terribly expensive,\u201d he said. Mr. Perazzi of Christie\u2019s said the auction house was \u201cseeing a lot more interest in brands like Omega and Longines. The first Omegas are extremely sought after and are extremely expensive compared to five or 10 years ago, the production in the late 1950s was just a few thousand models.\u201dAfter deciding on a desired model, a potential investor then has to find a watch in the right condition and at the right price. Experts say the cost of servicing should be considered, too, as regular maintenance can double the expense of a watch.And if a restoration is needed, getting it right can make the difference between a watch that resells for $10,000 and one that commands $100,000, Mr. Perazzi said. He added that the market had changed drastically since the early 2000s, when collectors started to pay more attention to the quality of the original watch. \u201cIf we can find pieces from the 1940s, \u201950s, \u201960s or \u201970s that are untouched \u2014 what we call \u2018new old stock watches\u2019 \u2014 worldwide collectors are willing to pay a big premium, whatever the brand,\u201d he said. He advises that restoration work should be kept to a minimum. \u201cDon\u2019t polish a piece, don\u2019t restore, clean or replace dials, even if it is scratched \u2014 it\u2019s better to keep it in its original, if imperfect, condition.\u201d But Mr. Perazzi added, \u201csophisticated movements do need to be oiled, so it\u2019s strongly recommended to only service the movement.\u201dOpinions about the correct way to restore an older timepiece are partly cultural, said Laurent Cantin, customer service director at Patek Philippe. The company\u2019s specialist department in Geneva restores watches dating from 1852 to 1970. \u201cIn the United States most people will want the watch completely refurbished like brand new,\u201d he said, \u201cwhereas in Japan, Switzerland or Germany, owners are more focused on preserving the original watch.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to restore the watch to its original condition, so we try to keep the original parts, even if there\u2019s rust or damage,\u201d he added.Mr. Cantin\u2019s opinion on restorations echoes Mr. Perazzi\u2019s: \u201cWhen it comes to restorations, from my point of view it is better keep the watch in the original condition as much as possible.\u201dAnd while Patek Philippe is generally considered one of the blue-chip brands for watch investments, Mr. Cantin says he believes that profit rarely motivates collectors. \u201cI would say the number of people who buy primarily as investors are the minority,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that for most of the collectors it\u2019s more in terms of emotion and something they can pass on.\u201dFor Mr. Kivel, at Central Watch, it comes down to whether a buyer wants to wear a watch, or keep it in a safe. \u201cIf you\u2019re investing, don\u2019t polish,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you want to enjoy it, I would suggest polishing it and it will come out like brand new. The best reason would be that you want to own a beautiful watch, and one that will last a lifetime and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caijing Journalist\u2019s Shaming Signals China\u2019s Growing Control Over News Media", "Date": "2015-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wang was compelled to confess on television before going to trial. Dressed in a green polo shirt and looking downcast, he told viewers of China Central Television, the main state network, that he had gathered information using private sources \u201cthrough abnormal channels,\u201d then added to this his \u201cown subjective views.\u201d The article in question, Mr. Wang said, was a \u201csensational\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d report on the stock market.That the state would take aim at a publication like Caijing came as a surprise to many. The magazine has a strong reputation for hard-hitting investigations and pushing the boundaries of what the government might deem permissible. Yet it has steered clear of prohibited topics like the Falun Gong movement.The publication was set up in 1998 by Ms. Hu, a former propaganda writer for the Communist Party publication Workers\u2019 Daily, and it took an aggressive journalistic approach from the beginning. The cover of the first issue focused on a property company with a rocketing share price that had been suspended from trading after overstating its profits. A few insiders were tipped off beforehand and managed to unload their shares.Caijing, a biweekly magazine with a circulation of 225,000, has continued chasing the same types of stories. Expos\u00e9s by Caijing \u2014 which means finance and economics in Chinese \u2014 have covered such topics as illegal securities trading, stock price manipulation and falsified profits. Some of the reports have prompted regulatory investigations.But for a business-focused publication, it has also ventured further into less traditional territory.In 2003, Caijing was one of the few Chinese media outlets to report critically on the SARS crisis. The government tried to control the story, said David Bandurski, an editor at the China Media Project based at the University of Hong Kong.In 2008, Caijing reported on how construction standards had been ignored and public money was wasted in Sichuan, leading to the collapse of many schools during an earthquake. Other publications were punished for covering the collapsed schools, but Caijing was not.Mr. Bandurski said the importance of economic reform to the government meant elites wanted strong financial reporting. Caijing seized the opportunity.Mr. Wang, who is president of the Stock Exchange Executive Council, or S.E.E.C., and helped establish the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, is now editor in chief at the magazine. Caijing is owned by S.E.E.C. Media, a company listed in Hong Kong, which sells advertising.Ms. Hu left along with most of the editorial team. She went on to form Caixin Media, a news group focused on finance.Caijing, observers say, has stayed at the forefront of financial reporting and has performed better than many expected. But the confession of Wang Xiaolu has some questioning whether free rein for Caijing, Caixin and publications like them is coming to an end, either because of government pressure or because journalists are trying to protect themselves.\u201cI think it is a crackdown on media and a step-up of censorship,\u201d said Mr. Cheng, a stock market investor in his 40s who wanted to be referred to only by his surname because of safety concerns. \u201cI can see that because of what happened to Caijing magazine, many media don\u2019t want to be the first one to report important news. Like the day before yesterday, China Securities Regulatory Commission started another action to further restrict loans for stock trading, but I can see that no media wanted to be the first one to report this.\u201dLuo Changping, a former deputy managing editor at Caijing, said people he knew who work at Caijing or have worked there are upset. And although anyone going into journalism in China knows the constraints they will work under, standards are changing, he added.\u201cMaybe a few years ago, the line was higher,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s dropping lower on everyone. Many journalists are saying that nowadays, there is no media that is safe. Everyone lives in a comparatively dangerous situation.\u201dHe said even Mr. Wang\u2019s confession was vague on exactly what he had done wrong.\u201cEverything he did was just his usual reporting work,\u201d said Mr. Luo. \u201cAnd we are all saying that a big part of journalists\u2019 job is \u2018privately gathering information.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOrville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society, said punishment of a Caijing journalist was a sign of tightening government control. Wang Boming is well connected, which \u201cwould afford a certain measure of protection. He knew where the lines were.\u201d\u201cWhen people like Wang Boming, a man who knows his way around town, can\u2019t protect his reporters, that says something,\u201d he said.Mr. Schell also added that the stock market was likely to be a particularly sensitive topic for financial journalists. The need to prop up share prices has become more pressing for the government, leaving less leeway for reporting.\u201cThis is a time-honored Mao tactic of the \u201930s and \u201940s,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see China returning to this strategy, for someone who has been watching China slowly open, become more relaxed with certain parts of its social structure like the media and society, this is quite a startling reverse.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Policy Mechanics Retool for a Rise in Interest Rates", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s easy to take for granted the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to raise interest rates. Even among the legions who doubt that Fed officials will pick the ideal moment to start increasing rates for the first time since 2008, few question the Fed\u2019s technical competence. The central bank has a long history. The engine is known to work.So it may come as a surprise to learn that the old engine is broken. When the Fed decides that it\u2019s time to \u201clift off\u201d \u2014 perhaps this week, but more likely later this year \u2014 it will be relying on a new system, assembled from spare parts, to make interest rates rise.There is a general agreement among economists and market analysts that the Fed\u2019s plans make sense in theory. A team led by Simon Potter, a former academic who now heads the Fed\u2019s market desk in New York, has been testing and fine-tuning the details by moving billions of dollars around the financial system.But markets have a long history of scrambling the best-laid plans.\u201cIf something is going to go wrong, I haven\u2019t been able to figure out what, but there\u2019s a lot of reason for caution,\u201d said Stephen G. Cecchetti, the former chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before.\u201dThe stakes are huge. The Fed is in charge of keeping economic growth on an even keel: minimal unemployment, moderate inflation. It tends to operate conservatively and to change very slowly because when it errs, the nation suffers.Yet the Fed has found itself forced to experiment. The immense stimulus campaign that it started in response to the 2008 financial crisis changed its relationship with the financial markets. It has pumped so many dollars into the system that it cannot easily drain enough money to discourage lending, its traditional approach. Instead, the Fed plans to throw more money at the problem, paying lenders not to make loans.The Fed, embedded in the banking system, has also concluded that working through the banks is no longer sufficient to influence the broader economy. It plans to strengthen its hold by working directly with an expanded range of lenders.Fed officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the plan will work. \u201cThe committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told Congress earlier this year, referring to its policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee.And if the new approach does not work at first, Mr. Potter said in a recent speech, then his team of monetary mechanics \u201cstands ready to innovate\u201d until it does.The markets desk at the New York Fed has put monetary policy into practice since the mid-1930s. In the decades before the Great Recession, the desk exercised its remarkable influence over the American economy through its control of an odd little marketplace in which banks could come to borrow money for a single night.The Fed requires banks to set aside reserves in proportion to the deposits the banks accept from customers. The reserves can be kept in cash or held in an account at the Fed. Banks that need reserves at the end of a given day can borrow from banks that have a surplus. Before the crisis, the Fed controlled the interest rate on those loans by modulating the supply of reserves: It lowered interest rates by buying Treasury securities from banks and crediting their accounts, increasing the supply of reserves; it raised rates by selling Treasuries to banks and debiting their accounts.As the crisis hit in 2008, the Fed pressed this machine to its limits. It bought enough securities and pumped enough reserves into the banking system to drive interest rates on short-term loans to nearly zero. The federal government now pays about a dime to borrow $1,000 for one month. Companies with good credit pay about a dollar to borrow $1,000 from money market funds and other investors.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.One result is a banking system almost comically awash in money. In June 2008, banks had about $10.1 billion in their Fed accounts. The total is now $2.6 trillion. Picture all of the money in June 2008 as a single brick; the Fed has added 256 bricks of the same size. On top of that first brick, there is now a stack five stories tall.Bank of America, for example, had $388 million in its Fed account at the end of June 2008. Seven years later, at the end of June 2015, it had $107 billion. The bank could double in size and double again and still have more reserves than it needs.To switch metaphors, the old monetary-policy machine sits at the bottom of a lake of excess reserves. The Fed would need to sell most of the securities it has accumulated before short-term rates would start to rise. Selling quickly could roil markets; selling slowly could allow the economy to overheat. So the Fed decided to find another way.Instead of draining all that excess money, the Fed decided to freeze it.For the last seven years, the Fed has encouraged financial risk-taking in the service of its campaign to increase employment and economic growth. By starting to raise interest rates, the Fed intends to gradually discourage risk-taking.The straightforward part of the plan is persuading banks not to make loans.In a serendipitous stroke, Congress passed a law shortly before the financial crisis that let the Fed pay interest on the reserves that banks kept at the Fed. Written as a sop to the banking industry, it has become the new linchpin of monetary policy.Say the Fed wanted to raise short-term interest rates to 1 percent, meaning that it did not want banks to lend at lower rates. Because the glut of reserves is so great, the Fed could not easily raise rates by reducing the availability of money. Instead, the Fed plans to pre-empt the market, paying banks 1 percent interest on reserves in their Fed accounts, so banks have little reason to lend at lower rates. \u201cWhy would you lend to anyone else when you can lend to the Fed?\u201d Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, asked rhetorically.At first, Fed officials thought that paying interest to banks would establish a minimum rate for all short-term loans, exerting the same kind of broad influence as the old system. It soon became clear, however, that rates on most such loans remained lower than 0.25 percent. Even banks that needed overnight loans found they could borrow more cheaply. The average rate in July was 0.13 percent \u2014 about half of the Fed\u2019s new benchmark rate.The rest of the financial system is also awash in cash, and lenders \u2014 like money market mutual funds \u2014 put downward pressure on interest rates as they fight to attract borrowers.And here\u2019s where the Fed\u2019s plans got a little less orthodox.The Fed lacks the legal authority to pay these lenders a minimum interest rate on deposits, as it does to the banks. But two years ago, Lorie Logan, one of Mr. Potter\u2019s top aides, suggested the Fed could achieve the same goal by borrowing from these companies at a minimum interest rate.The resulting deals, known as overnight reverse repurchase agreements, signal a significant break from the Fed\u2019s history of working through only the banking industry.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing more activity out of the regulated banking sector, and so monetary policy has to take account of the unregulated sector,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who until recently served as an adviser to Ms. Yellen, and before that to her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. \u201cThe world is changing, and I think the bigger risk is not changing along with it.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.When liftoff arrives, however, the Fed plans to place this machinery inside the familiar language of the old system. It is likely to announce that it is raising the federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks pay to borrow reserves, from its current range of 0 to 0.25 percent to a new range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The Fed does not plan to emphasize that this rate is now a stage prop or that the real work of raising rates will be done outside the limelight by its new tools.On weekdays at about 12:45 p.m., the New York Fed\u2019s trading portal, known as FedTrade, plays three musical notes \u2014 F-E-D \u2014 signaling that Mr. Potter\u2019s shop is open for business. So begins another day of training camp, another test of the Fed\u2019s plans to borrow money from nonbank financial companies.The Fed\u2019s traders sit at terminals in a converted conference room. Along one wall are five chairs and five sets of computer monitors beneath five historical photographs of the trading desk: men answering phones, men writing bids in chalk on a long board and, in the most recent photograph, from the 1980s, a glimpse of a woman in the background. On another wall is a screen that links the room in New York by videoconference with a backup trading room at the Chicago Fed.Potential lenders \u2014 a preapproved group of 168, including a bevy of money market funds and the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 have 30 minutes to offer the Fed up to $30 billion each. At 1:13 p.m., a warning message starts blinking red. At 1:15 p.m., the Fed closes the auction and accepts up to $300 billion in loans at an interest rate of 0.05 percent.During two years of experiments, the Fed team has adjusted the rates it pays, the amounts it accepts and the time it enters the market, among other variables. Mr. Potter and his lieutenants have also held lunch meetings with investors on the other side of the portal to solicit advice and complaints.The size of the program poses the most obvious risk. Fed officials limited daily borrowing to $300 billion because they didn\u2019t want to freeze more money than necessary. They also worry about exacerbating market downturns by giving investors a new place to flee. These concerns were heightened by reports that some investment companies were interested in creating money market funds that would be advertised as the safest place to park money \u2014 because the money would be parked at the Fed.Last year, at the end of September, shortly after the cap was imposed, lenders offered the Fed $407 billion on a single day. Demand was so high that instead of asking for interest, some lenders offered to pay the Fed to take the money. The Fed ended up borrowing at zero percent and turning away $107 billion in loans.A cardinal rule of central banking is that you don\u2019t starve financial markets during panics, and the Fed has been leaning in the direction of doing more. It has already announced that it is willing to borrow at least $200 billion through a parallel program at the end of September this year, for a total of $500 billion. It has also suggested that it may raise the cap during liftoff. \u201cMy sense is we\u2019re better off making sure we can maintain control,\u201d James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in a recent interview.\u201cThis is where the nutty people on the bond-trading desks have control,\u201d joked Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, when asked if the Fed\u2019s plan would work.Mr. Blinder\u2019s point was that markets ultimately determined the cost of borrowing money, particularly for longer-term loans like mortgages and corporate bonds. The Fed can be precise in its planning, but the market is unpredictable in its reactions.But there are at least three reasons markets are becoming less predictable.The rise of an interconnected global financial system has weakened the Fed\u2019s influence over interest rates. When the Fed last raised short-term rates, beginning in 2004, officials were surprised that long-term rates failed to rise because foreign money was pouring into the housing market and other domestic investments. This time, there are plenty of warnings that the weaknesses of other developed economies could once again make it harder for the Fed to raise domestic interest rates.\u201cFinancial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments at home but also on developments abroad,\u201d William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a February speech in which he cautioned the Fed\u2019s control over those conditions had been \u201cloosened.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s audience also increasingly consists of computer programs that will start buying and selling securities before people have time to read the first words of the Fed\u2019s policy statement, creating the potential for new kinds of chaos.On Oct. 15, for example, automated trading programs drove up the price of 10-year Treasuries in a burst of buying so intense that a government report later found the machines bought more than 10 percent of the securities from their own firms. Then, just as quickly, the computers turned around and drove prices back down.The 12-minute spree was among the largest price movements ever seen in one of the world\u2019s most liquid markets, yet the government report found no clear cause.Finally, investors say regulatory changes are keeping some large traders on the sidelines, making it harder to buy and sell, even in the highly liquid market for Treasuries. That can exacerbate market movements because when people are in a hurry to buy or sell, they tend to chase the best available offers. \u201cThe depth of the market is not what it used to be,\u201d said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, a Los Angeles investment firm that manages some of the world\u2019s largest bond funds. \u201cYou can get the same trades done, but it takes more time.\u201dOther observers, however, urge a broader perspective.Moreover, Mr. Cecchetti said that removing some liquidity was a good thing because much of that liquidity was a result of public subsidies for the banking system that had encouraged undue risk-taking.\u201cDoes it mean that there\u2019s going to be more high-frequency volatility? Sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the Simon Potters of the world are going to have to be much more careful about what they\u2019re doing. But that seems to me to be kind of O.K.\u201dMr. Potter has worked at the New York Fed since the late 1990s, but he spent most of his career there in the research department before taking over the markets desk in 2012. He became more involved in the practical side of the Fed\u2019s work during the financial crisis. In a 2012 speech at New York University, Mr. Potter said the experience \u2014 particularly during a four-week period at the peak of the crisis \u2014 had impressed upon him the limits of theory, the need to understand what investors are thinking and the value of flexibility in policy making.\u201cFor economists who did not have the opportunity to observe the panic up close as I and most of my colleagues had, the developments in this four-week period must have been bewildering, given how widely events on the ground and theory diverged,\u201d he said.That perspective may come in handy. The last time the Fed shifted the basic mechanics of monetary policy was in the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker was its chairman. That campaign is remembered as a triumph of central banking. Mr. Volcker succeeded in driving inflation down toward modern levels, ending a long period in which governments had floundered helplessly to prevent rising prices.But Mr. Faust, the Johns Hopkins economist, says the messiness of Mr. Volcker\u2019s triumph is often overlooked. The Fed\u2019s initial plans did not work and were revised and did not work and were revised again \u2014 and still didn\u2019t work.He said the Volcker episode was a reminder that monetary policy is not figure skating. The Fed is likely to flail, he says, but it will be measured by its success in getting interest rates to rise, not by the grace of its performance.\u201cIf you\u2019re into the internal plumbing, I suspect there will be times when that looks messy because this is new,\u201d Mr. Faust said. \u201cBut central banks can raise interest rates, and they will. And as long as that happens, from the standpoint of the broader economy, everything is fine and the rest will be forgotten or become a footnote of history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Call for a Free Market", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe worldwide turbulence of recent days is a strong indication that government intervention alone cannot restore the economy and offers a glimpse of the risk of completely depending on it. It is time to give the free market a chance.Since the crash of 2008, governments have tried to stimulate their economies by a variety of means but have relied heavily on manipulating interest rates lower through one form or other of quantitative easing or simply printing money. The immediate rescue of the collapsing economy was necessary at the time, but the manipulation has now gone on for nearly seven years and has produced many unwanted consequences.It has exacerbated the inequality of income around the world. Money has been artificially allocated by the abnormally low rates to reward speculation and to discourage savings and longer-term investments that produce real economic and employment growth.The Federal Reserve, waiting for signs of inflation to change its policies, seems to be looking at the wrong data. Actually its policies have been highly effective in the areas stimulated most heavily, but the low interest rate policies have not stimulated the broad economy or made most people better off. In fact, it may have actually hurt those people.Low interest rates have hugely lifted assets largely owned by the very rich, and inflation in these areas is clearly apparent. Stocks have tripled and real estate prices in the major cities where the wealthy live have been soaring, as have the prices of artwork and the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods.Cheap financing has led to a boom in speculative activity, and mergers and acquisitions. Most acquisitions are justified by \u201cefficiencies\u201d which is usually a euphemism for layoffs. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, one of the nation\u2019s most active acquirers, routinely fires \u201credundant\u201d workers after each acquisition to enhance reported earnings. This elevates its stock, with which it makes the next acquisition. With money cheap, corporate executives have used cash flow to buy back stock, enhancing the value of their options, instead of investing for the future. This pattern, and the fear it engenders, has added to downward pressure on employment and wages.Similarly, older adults and those on fixed incomes are getting next to nothing on their savings. In a typical bank today, $1 million astonishingly yields only about $2,000 a year. As interest income has fallen for seniors, their spending has understandably moderated. Thus consumer spending, which would have otherwise expanded the broad economy, has been sluggish.Extended Fed intervention has actually increased the risks of severe trouble ahead. Many pension systems are woefully underfunded because, while their liabilities are fixed, their fixed-income investments yield far below their actuarial assumptions. This forces them to take greater risks or to seek other means to close the gap. Historically this hasn\u2019t ended well.So, the income gap widens. The rich get richer and most of the country is treading water at best, not what one would expect from a Democratic administration ostensibly committed to the broader public.Another risk of the current policy is that investors, rather than doing their own thinking, have increasingly been taking their cue from the Fed. They are addicted to stimulus, like a drug. In the short term, markets are gyrating less on an analysis of fundamentals and more, buffeted by the endless speculation of the talking heads, on the basis of whether they believe they can rely on the Fed to enrich them or bail them out.An even more concerning trend has emerged in the last few weeks. With huge Chinese stimulus failing to support its manipulated stock market through currency devaluation, cash infusions and eased rules, the presumed confidence in the ability of central banks to control economies has come into question. Further, there is a growing realization that, by keeping interest rates at essentially zero, the tools the central banks have available to arrest another decline are very limited.The Fed should raise rates in September. The focus on a quarter-point change in short rates and its precise date of imposition is foolishness. Expected rates of return on new investments are typically well above 10 percent. No sensible businessman would defer a sound investment because short-term rates are slightly higher for a few months. They either have a sound investment or they don\u2019t. The reluctance to raise rates now would likely do more harm than good as it would suggest to investors that the Fed foresees a more fragile recovery. This might encourage the businessman to hold off on planned investments, further undermining the recovery.David Rocker is the founder and former managing general partner of the hedge fund Rocker Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Price Increase for Tuberculosis Drug Is Rescinded", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA huge overnight price increase for an important tuberculosis drug has been rescinded after the company that acquired the drug gave it back to its previous owner under pressure, it was announced on Monday.The cases of Daraprim and of the tuberculosis drug, cycloserine, are examples of a relatively new business strategy \u2014 acquiring old, neglected drugs, often for rare diseases, and turning them into costly \u201cspecialty\u201d drugs.Cycloserine was acquired last month by Rodelis Therapeutics, which promptly raised the price to $10,800 for 30 capsules, from $500.But the company agreed to return the drug to its former owner, a nonprofit organization affiliated with Purdue University, the organization said on Monday.\u201cWe discovered literally on Thursday the strategy that had been undertaken\u201d by Rodelis, said Dan Hasler, the president of the Purdue Research Foundation, which has oversight of the manufacturing operation. \u201cWe said this was not what we had intended.\u201dBy Saturday, he said, Rodelis had agreed to give back the drug. Rodelis confirmed this in a brief statement on its website.The foundation now will charge $1,050 for 30 capsules, twice what it charged before, but far less than Rodelis was charging. Mr. Hasler said the new price was needed to stem losses.Cycloserine is used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a serious form of the disease that does not respond to the usual drugs. There are only about 90 new cases a year in the United States, Mr. Hasler said, and about half those patients get treated with cycloserine.Infectious disease specialists, who have protested the price increase, question the need for new drugs for toxoplasmosis and say that if Turing wants to develop such drugs, it should use money from investors. They say the price increase will raise the cost of treating some adult patients with toxoplasmosis to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, sent Turing a letter on Monday demanding information on the price increase.Rodelis, which increased the price of the tuberculosis drug, said last week it needed to invest to make sure the supply of the drug remained reliable. Rodelis reveals almost no information about itself, such as the names of its executives, directors or investors, on its web page.Mr. Hasler, a former Lilly executive, said the Chao Center had lost about $10 million on the drug since 2007 because of the small number of patients and high regulatory costs. So the Chao Center was interested when it was approached by Rodelis. \u201cThey found us,\u201d Mr. Hasler said.A patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis might take two capsules a day of cycloserine, along with other drugs, for 18 to 24 months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under the price Rodelis planned to charge, a full course of treatment would have cost more than $500,000 for cycloserine alone. With the new price from the Chao Center, it will be closer to $50,000.The drug made by generic companies abroad costs only about $20 for 100 capsules.Amir Attaran, an expert on pharmaceutical access issues at the University of Ottawa, said it would have made much more sense to just import the drug from abroad, rather than have it produced in America for so few patients at such high cost.Mr. Hasler said this was probably not done because foreign manufacturers were not willing to bear the expense of applying for regulatory approval in the United States.Dr. Attaran said Lilly should have kept more control over pricing. \u201cThere\u2019s an obligation on their part, having transferred this, to ensure that the objective of the philanthropic initiative continues to be met,\u201d he said.Lilly said that to comply with antitrust rules it retained no control over pricing once it transferred the rights to the Chao Center and had no say when Chao transferred the rights to Rodelis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Faced a Test in August, and Faltered", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseA surge in volatility. Plunging global stock markets. A surprise Chinese currency devaluation.So how did hedge funds fare last month?The results are mixed. The average hedge fund, as measured by the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, declined 2.2 percent. In comparison, the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended down 6.3 percent in August, while another benchmark, a standard mix of 60 percent United States stocks and 40 percent bonds dropped 3.6 percent.Over the last year, including August, hedge funds lagged far behind, losing on average about 3.5 percent compared with a decline of about 1.6 percent in the S.&P. 500 and a gain of roughly 1 percent in the 60/40 benchmark index. Longer term, hedge funds have underperformed benchmarks over five- and 10-year periods.\u201cAugust was a fair test, and many hedge funds had a tough time,\u201d said Simon Lack, founder of the financial consultancy SL Advisors and author of \u201cThe Hedge Fund Mirage\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cWall Street Potholes.\u201d Hedge funds \u201chave failed to beat a 60/40 mix every single year since 2002, and they\u2019re on track to repeat this year.\u201dHedge funds come in many varieties, but nearly all of them share two qualities: high fees and the premise that they will counter volatility in stocks while generating high returns.By charging a percentage of assets under management (often 2 percent) and a cut of any profits (typically 20 percent, though some go as high as 40 percent) hedge funds generate lucrative fees in good times and bad, minting scores of billionaire managers.Does their performance justify the extraordinary pay? Averages like the HFRX global index mask a wide range of performance by individual hedge funds and the various strategies they deploy. Some prominent funds performed admirably in August. Citadel\u2019s flagship fund was up nearly 1 percent, and Millennium Management was flat.But some of the most successful alternative funds during the period have weak longer-term records. The MainStay Marketfield fund, one of the earliest and largest alternative funds, which was singled out by Mr. Charlson for its positive 0.98 percent return during the plunge, has lost more than 13 percent during the last year, according to Morningstar, and has had large investor withdrawals.\u201cMany people had unrealistic expectations that these funds should gain during severe market downturns,\u201d Mr. Charlson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how they\u2019re designed; the goal is lower volatility.\u201d At the same time, \u201cOver longer periods, they don\u2019t look very good compared to the market as a whole. \u201cThere are also much cheaper ways to profit from market drops than hedge funds, such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds that bet on market declines. The average bear market fund (funds that bet on market drops) tracked by Morningstar gained 13.4 percent over the last month, far surpassing hedge fund returns. But their longer track records are dismal given the long-running bull market: a negative 19.3 percent over three years and negative 21.8 percent over five.With such divergent results, picking the right fund is critical. \u201cThere will always be a few great funds with happy investors, but it\u2019s a hell of a job figuring out who those are,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cAnd the more you pick, the more your skill at picking will diminish.\u201d As a result, he is critical of large state pension funds and endowments that invest with numerous hedge funds. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should have more than three or four,\u201d otherwise returns just revert to the average, he said.Just this week, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the nation\u2019s second largest pension fund after Calpers, said it might move as much as $20 billion into alternatives including hedge funds, citing concerns about higher volatility.That institutions keep pouring money into hedge funds despite their underwhelming track record and steep fees is a tribute to their sales and marketing pitches, which have capitalized on still-vivid memories of the financial crisis and a low interest-rate environment in which the traditional safety of United States Treasury bonds is likely to yield minuscule returns. Moreover, \u201cthere are all these highly paid consultants and advisers telling clients to put money in hedge funds,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get paid much to tell people to put money in Vanguard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Strategies Meant as Buffers to Volatility May Have Deepened It ", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wall Street, a cure is proving to be nearly as bad as the disease.Investment strategies that promise to insulate investors from risk are being seen as actually having contributed to the wild market swings in recent weeks.That seemingly upside-down outcome follows an explosion in investments aimed at avoiding pratfalls in the market, as opposed to making direct bets on a company, asset class or theme, and has become an investment rage in recent years.Their popularity boomed after global central banks pumped trillions of dollars into asset markets in a bid to spur economic growth.Analysts estimate that there is currently around $4 trillion tied up in these investment strategies. The fear is that as their returns continue to suffer, a wave of investor selling will start a wider market rout as managers struggle to unload high-yield, high-return bonds and equities alike.\u201cThe professional investment community is very worried about this,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes.Mr. Brigden contends that this latest flurry of sophisticated investment vehicles produced by Wall Street has created a false impression of robust investment returns with minimal downside risks.\u201cIt\u2019s this constant striving by the Street to satiate investor demand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you keep seeing these leveraged risk-parity funds and power E.T.Fs.\u201dRisk-parity funds, for example, have used leverage to reduce the exposure that portfolios have to stocks (which tend to be more volatile investments) by loading up on emerging-market and high-yield bonds. The idea is to give investors equitylike returns without the volatility and concentration risk that comes from making a big bet on stocks.Then there are exchange-traded funds, investment vehicles that track an index linked to an investment style (stocks, bonds or commodities to name a few), but trade on exchanges and promise the investor instant liquidity and transparency.Trading in E.T.F.s now accounts for close to 20 percent of total volume for stocks in the United States. While many investors in some of the larger funds, like the $169 billion SPDR fund, which tracks the Standard Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, are in it for the long term, there is a lot of short-term-oriented buying and selling that goes on within the fund.Over the last month, however, China\u2019s decision to let its currency weaken has set off a new wave of market turmoil. Bonds that were supposed to provide stability to investor portfolios have declined in value along with stocks.Making matters worse is that central banks in China and other Asian countries, which for years have been large buyers of United States Treasury securities, have started to sell out of these positions to defend their weakening currencies.With many of these bonds being core holdings in E.T.F. and risk-parity portfolios, the downward pressure on markets has been amplified.Last month, for example, Mr. Dalio\u2019s All Weather hedge fund was down 4 percent, quite a sharp decrease for a fund that aims to insulate investors from precisely these types of sharp market movements. For the year, All Weather has lost 4.1 percent.Of course, Mr. Dalio\u2019s risk-parity strategy has had a long record of success. Its All Weather fund has returned 8 percent since its inception in 1996. Last year, the fund was up 7.5 percent.Defenders of risk-parity investing say that these investment styles are not set in stone and that portfolios can be recalibrated on fairly short notice to make them less vulnerable.As for E.T.F.s, practitioners say that the funds to date have held their own despite some concerns over how portfolios were being valued during the very sharp market sell-off late last month.Some of the more exotic E.T.F.s that rely on leverage to juice investment returns could in some instances be the \u201ctail that wags the dog,\u201d said Steven Schoenfeld, an early pioneer in E.T.F. investing and founder of BlueStar Global Investors.\u201cBut the fundamental advantage of E.T.F.s \u2014 transparency, liquidity and variety \u2014 that remains,\u201d he said.What remains unclear, however, is how an investing community that has become accustomed to churning out safe and steady returns in a low interest rate, low volatility environment adapts to the new reality of wild market swings.Such sharp ups and downs in the market are expected to become more frequent as the time approaches for the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher.People might as well get used to them, says Nicolas Just, a portfolio manager at Natixis Asset Management, a French fund company that oversees $904 billion in assets.\u201cThese types of sudden market swings will become more and more frequent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have to be prepared for them at any time.\u201dTo survive such bouts of volatility, Mr. Just and his team of number-crunchers do not waste time trying to predict the growth rate of the Chinese economy or whether the Fed will go forward with its stated plan to raise rates sometime in the near future.Instead, they use a computer model that selects stocks from all over the world that do not shoot sharply up and down along with the broader stock market.If you pick a basket of stocks that are not volatile and not correlated with each other, Mr. Just argues, you can lock in safe and steady gains on the upside and suffer less than the broader market on the downside.To date, Mr. Just says that his portfolio has suffered less than the broader market. This year, Mr. Just\u2019s global minimum variance fund is up 7.8 percentOn a broader scale though, Mr. Brigden, the investment adviser, thinks that the shakeout of the last month will continue as investors come to realize that the days of low volatility investing are over.\u201cWe have had this long backdrop of suppressed volatility with equities doing well and an utter lack of bond risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWith central banks no longer buying bonds, that virtuous circle is becoming vicious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Extreme Weather and Food Shocks", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRecent events highlight concerns about the risks to global food security posed by changing patterns of extreme weather affecting the world\u2019s \u201cbreadbasket\u201d regions such as the American Midwest, South America\u2019s southern cone, the Black Sea and the Yangtze River valley. In 2012, the worst drought to hit the U.S. Midwest in half a century sent international maize and soybean prices to record levels. In 2011, wheat prices nearly doubled after an unprecedented heat wave devastated the Russian harvest. The global food price crisis of 2007-8 had its roots in a run of poor harvests in previous years.Global food security largely depends on the production of a few \u201cmega-crops\u201d in the breadbasket regions: maize, wheat, rice and soybeans. On the whole, the system works well. International trade provides a global market for these specialized production centers, reducing the cost of food for billions of people by allowing agriculture to flourish where it can be most efficient. Trade also allows countries to meet unforeseen production shortfalls through imports, as Britain did in the summer of 2013 after floods spoiled the winter wheat harvest. But when extreme weather ruins the harvest in a breadbasket region, that\u2019s not just a problem in the country affected, it\u2019s a problem for all importing countries.Of course the risk to the world\u2019s food security doesn\u2019t arise simply from bouts of bad weather. Weather\u2019s impact can be compounded by the actions of governments and markets. Governments can make things much worse when, for example, they try to shore up domestic food supplies by banning or limiting agricultural exports, further pushing up international prices. The 2007-8 crisis saw over 30 governments impose export restrictions in a spiral of rising prices and collapsing market confidence; the 2011 wheat spike was amplified when Russia turned off exports.Likewise it is becoming clear that severe weather shocks rippling through the food system can ignite wider instability. During the 2007-8 crisis, protests erupted in 61 countries and turned violent in 23. In the wake of the Russian heat wave, the price of bread was one of several grievances behind the Arab Spring. Once shocks to the food system spill over into other areas, they can cascade through economic and political systems with sometimes devastating consequences.Amid these pressures, the global food system is coming under increasing strain, as highlighted in a recent report that we wrote in conjunction with other British and American experts for the U.K.-led Global Food Security program. Rising incomes and changing dietary preferences mean demand for food is growing faster than cereal yields. Water scarcity and soil depletion present challenges for agriculture, which faces sharper competition for resources from urbanization and energy production. A precarious supply-and-demand balance means the system is easily unbalanced.The stability of the global food system faces risks from the increasingly frequent extreme weather that is being driven by climate change. For example, in the United States there were more than four times more weather events causing damage in excess of $1 billion (in 2011 prices) in 2007-11 than in 1980-85. Drought is a particularly powerful driver of global food shocks. Two episodes stand out: in 1988-9, when maize and soybean were seriously affected in the U.S. Midwest, and in 2002-3, when rice and wheat were hit in Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Were these two events to happen in the same year \u2014 a multiple breadbasket failure \u2014 it would result in the loss of between 5 and 10 percent of the production of these major crops, more than enough to supply the basic calorie needs of the United States for a year. Until recently, such a calamity would have been expected every 100 to 200 years, but this number is shrinking rapidly due to climate change. An initial analysis of recent data suggests that the risk of a 1-in-100-year event during the second half of the last century is likely to increase to 1-in-30 years by 2040 \u2014 and perhaps even 1-in-15 years in the decades after 2050.A multiple failure in the world\u2019s breadbaskets in the same year is, in our view, a plausible worst-case scenario for today. In fact, by the end of the century such an event may occur every few years unless we reduce emissions overall, and we change what we grow, and how we grow it, to adapt to the changing climate. Such a crisis would almost certainly be compounded by export restrictions, panic buying and hoarding, driving food prices to new heights.This would be particularly serious for the food-importing countries of the developing world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The shock would come at the economic level, in the form of inflation, balance-of-payment difficulties and budgetary pressures, and it would strike at the human level in increasing poverty; in the developed economies, consumers would feel the pinch as grocery prices climbed. Of even more concern, however, would be the spread of the crisis from food markets to political systems in the world\u2019s geopolitical hotspots; fragile countries could be destabilized, especially the major grain importers of the Middle East and North Africa.Given these predictions and warnings, what needs to be done?Agriculture must of course be adapted to a dramatically changing climate: We need to reverse declines in yield growth. This requires significantly more research and development investment to increase maximum attainable yields and to expand agricultural extension services. Additional investment is needed to reduce the environmental impact of farming and to bolster its ability to withstand climate change.In addition, vulnerable countries can shore up their food security through policy measures to insulate their populations from market shocks. Such efforts include holding strategic stocks, raising national production to reduce import dependency and improve self-sufficiency, and \u201cbuying forward\u201d to lock in future import prices.The greatest challenge will be to make the global food system far more resilient. Rules limiting the use of export barriers will become vital if a functional trading system is to be maintained. Biofuel policies will also need to be reformed by making mandates flexible, so that biofuel use falls when food prices rise, or by limiting the use of staple food crops in biofuel production when food demand outstrips supply.Recent multilateral efforts to improve the quality and availability of key market data, such as food stock levels, can help governments anticipate crises and avoid panic. But improved climate and economic modeling is needed to understand the risks and assess how best to manage them. Armed with this knowledge, governments, international organizations and businesses could engage in contingency planning, set up early-warning systems, and coordinate the management of strategic stocks.International food shocks exacerbated by extreme weather events can affect millions of people in countries around the world. Taking smart and practical steps to ease the impact of our changing climate on our food supplies is vital if we are to ride out the droughts and storms that will impact our food prices.Tim Benton is the academic director of the Global Security Program and a professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds.

{"Headline": "Decades-Old Questions Over Trump\u2019s Wealth and Education", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneOne of the bugs involves his academic record at the prestigious Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Another involves his net worth. Both issues are central to his identity as a successful businessman and in both cases he has been less than fully transparent.Mr. Trump transferred to Wharton after two years at Fordham University in the Bronx, and he graduated in 1968 with an undergraduate degree in economics. Mr. Trump is understandably proud of graduating from Wharton, and the presidential candidate talks about it all the time.\u201cI went to the Wharton School of Finance,\u201d he said in a July 11 speech in Phoenix. \u201cI\u2019m, like, a really smart person.\u201d On Aug. 16, he told Chuck Todd, on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d about the school: It\u2019s \u201cprobably the hardest there is to get into,\u201d and, \u201cSome of the great business minds in the world have gone to Wharton.\u201dMr. Geist pointed out that \u201cjust about every profile ever written\u201d about Mr. Trump \u2014 including stories in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 \u2014 journalists say that he graduated first in his class at Wharton. \u201cAlthough the school refused comment, the commencement program from 1968 does not list him as graduating with honors of any kind,\u201d Mr. Geist wrote.In August, The Daily Pennsylvanian, the University of Pennsylvania newspaper, tried to get to the bottom of whether Mr. Trump did in fact graduate first in his class at Wharton. The paper cited a 1985 Trump biography, by Jerome Tuccille, that said Mr. Trump was not an honor student and \u201cspent a lot of time on outside business activities.\u201d Gwenda Blair, another Trump biographer, wrote that he was able to get into Wharton only because a \u201cfriendly\u201d admissions officer knew his older brother, Fred Trump Jr., and did him a favor. A classmate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, Steven Perelman, told the paper, \u201cHe was not in any kind of leadership. I certainly doubt he was the smartest guy in the class.\u201d Unless Mr. Trump releases to the public his Wharton transcripts \u2014 which he has declined to do \u2014 we won\u2019t know for sure, of course, whether he was an all-star at Wharton or not.In 2006, Donald Trump sued a writer for libel because he had written that Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth was far less than the $4 billion to $6 billion he was claiming back then.Mr. O\u2019Brien put Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth at $150 million to $250 million. Mr. Trump objected to the characterization of his wealth as so minuscule. He wanted $5 billion in damages. In July 2009, a judge in southern New Jersey dismissed the case, finding that Mr. O\u2019Brien did not act with reckless disregard for the truth. The court did not make any determination about Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth. Mr. Trump appealed. In September 2011, he lost the appeal, although he told me a few years ago in an interview that he still believed that Mr. O\u2019Brien had libeled him and that the libel laws were unfair to public figures like him. \u201cEssentially, the judge just said, \u2018Trump is too famous,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s so famous that you\u2019re allowed to say anything you want about him.\u2019 Well, I disagree with that.\u201dMr. Trump now puts his net worth at $10 billion. But in a deposition he gave in 2007 in connection with the O\u2019Brien lawsuit, it was clear that Mr. Trump gave himself a lot of latitude in calculating his wealth. Mr. Trump explained that he tries to be \u201ctruthful\u201d about his net worth, but then he acknowledged: \u201cMy net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings \u2014 even my own feelings \u2014 but I try,\u201d he said, adding that he was no different from \u201ca politician running for office. You always put the best foot forward. So you don\u2019t want to say negative things.\u201dHe also demonstrated a surprising lack of knowledge about a basic fundamental principle of corporate finance \u2014 called net present value \u2014 that bankers and traders the world over use to value assets or companies, especially private ones like Mr. Trump\u2019s for which there are no publicly traded stocks. Whether Mr. Trump understood this basic valuation concept arose in the context of questions about how he valued his golf courses. (Net present value, by the way, compares the value of receiving a dollar today with the value of receiving a dollar in the future, taking into account a variety of risk factors.)The deposition wasn\u2019t a finance exam and not every successful businessman has to be conversant in the arcane terms of the discipline.But Wharton teaches the concept of net present value in its introductory finance courses. A top Wharton graduate who excelled in finance would probably remember that.Now that Mr. Trump is a front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, I was unable to talk to him directly about how he gets to his $10 billion net worth calculation. But a spokeswoman answered some of my questions on Wednesday. She said she couldn\u2019t speak to his knowledge of net present value in 2007, but she said he knew the meaning of it now \u201cas anyone would.\u201d She put his 2014 income at $600 million, although his Federal Election Commission form says it was $362 million. (He told Rolling Stone magazine a few weeks ago that he makes \u201cbetween $400 and $600 million a year.\u201d)I asked her to share with me the Trump Organization\u2019s five-year financial projections so that I could begin to calculate how to value Mr. Trump\u2019s business. His spokeswoman said she doubted he would agree to share those projections with me, although on Thursday morning she sent me a one-page document showing his net worth at $8.7 billion as of June 2014. His most valuable asset on this document was his \u201cbrand,\u201d at $3.3 billion. She did not provide any backup to these calculations, and, of course, a balance sheet at a point in time is not the same as five-year projections that bankers use to value private companies such as Mr. Trump\u2019s. She also did not respond to later attempts to get clarity on whether Mr. Trump was first in his class at Wharton.C\u2019mon Mr. Trump, be a sport. Since you\u2019ve boasted so openly about being so rich and so smart, reconsider on both counts. What\u2019s the harm in letting us see those Wharton grades and sharing your company\u2019s projections so we can begin to figure out if your $10 billion net worth is accurate? It\u2019s a teachable moment.William D. Cohan is a former senior mergers and acquisitions banker who has written three books about Wall Street.

{"Headline": "A Wild Month on Wall St. Ends Quietly ", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor several years, parking one\u2019s savings in the United States stock market seemed like a no-brainer. Not only did stocks steadily climb \u2014 giving investors far better returns than they could get from their bank accounts \u2014 the ride up was smooth.Then August broke the calm.Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, tumbled 6.3 percent in August, finishing the month on Monday with a decline of 16.69 points, or 0.8 percent, for the day. It was the worst monthly performance for the benchmark in over three years. The decline wiped more than $1 trillion off the value of stocks.Crucially, the turbulence interrupted an unusually long period of tranquillity for investors.On five trading days in August, the S.&P. 500 moved up or down by more than 2 percent. Moves of that magnitude have been relatively rare in recent years.\u201cWe were in a bull market in complacency,\u201d said Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management, a hedge fund firm. \u201cI think that the spike in volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the last 10 days is the precursor to further spikes.\u201dIn recent days, investors sold heavily as they grappled with new and old concerns.On Aug. 24, the Dow Jones industrial average was down over 1,000 points at one point during the day, before recovering somewhat. For the month, the Dow was down 6.6 percent, after losing 114.98 points, or 0.7 percent, on Monday.The main source of worry continues to be China\u2019s $10 trillion economy, which appears to be slowing more than analysts had originally thought. The slowdown has raised fears that the country will now buy fewer goods and services from other countries, weighing on a global economy that has consistently struggled to gain traction since the financial crisis of 2008.China\u2019s leaders surprised financial markets with a surprise devaluation of the country\u2019s currency on Aug. 11. And their efforts to shore up the stock market with interventions seemed to erode, rather than build, confidence.But over the weekend, other Fed officials at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., indicated that an increase could still take place in September. If a raise were to happen, it would most likely be announced after Fed meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.Still, as August ended, some analysts found reasons to believe that the markets may have found a bottom.\u201cI think we got the summer flu,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets, \u201cand this is behind us.\u201dOne potentially bullish indicator is the price of oil. The benchmark New York crude contract has soared 26 percent from its low last week, to $48.32 a barrel on Monday. Oil had slumped this year, suggesting that demand for the commodity was falling as economies around the world slowed.The latest bounce indicates that investors are betting that demand for oil will not weaken further.\u201cThis is at least a sign that we\u2019re not having an economic collapse,\u201d Mr. Golub said.Stocks are no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for when a market declines by more than 10 percent from its highs. The S.&P. 500 is now 7.5 percent below its all-time nominal high, reached in May. At its low last week, it was more than 12 percent lower.At the end of trading on Monday, the Dow was 9.7 percent below its peak. The technology-heavy Nasdaq is now down 8.5 percent from its high. Unlike the other two market measures, however, it is up since the start of the year, by 0.9 percent.Worries about the Fed and China came at a time when valuations on United States stocks \u2014 the yardsticks investors apply to stocks to decide if they are worth buying \u2014 were starting to look expensive. A big debate on Wall Street now is whether corporate earnings are strong enough to make stocks resilient if faced with further shocks from overseas and uncertainty about monetary policy.Some analysts still see enough strength to sustain the bull market for United States stocks that started back in 2009.\u201cWhat we do is fall back on our process and our models,\u201d said Mark H. Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS\u2019s wealth management arm. \u201cThe crucial factor for us is the economic data \u2014 and the U.S. economy is doing well.\u201dAccording to Mr. Golub, United States corporations have been consistently squeezing out higher profits each year. Companies have achieved this, he says, by increasing revenue, cutting costs and buying back stock, which increases earnings on a per-share basis, a number that investors carefully track. \u201cIt\u2019s more sustainable than people think,\u201d Mr. Golub said.But some analysts remain cautious. In a world characterized by low economic growth, corporate earnings are vulnerable. Stock valuations, the analysts say, may need to move down to reflect the risk that profits growth may wane.\u201cThe fundamentals around the world are still wobbly,\u201d Mr. Kass, the hedge fund manager, said. \u201cAnd valuations are still elevated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Subscription Snacks, Entrepreneurs Think Inside the Box", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen promotions for two subscription snack box services, Naturebox and Graze, popped up in his Facebook feed, Matt Feit was interested.\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in snacking, having worked to completely change the way I\u2019m eating,\u201d said Mr. Feit, an aspiring horror and comedy writer who lives in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019ve turned lunch into two smaller meals and have a snack at the end of the day, all healthy stuff.\u201dHe placed orders to try both, first Naturebox, then Graze, and even sent his father a snack subscription as a gift.But after one or two boxes arrived, Mr. Feit had had enough. Naturebox\u2019s online interface was \u201ca little wonky,\u201d he said, and both services were trying to sell him what they had on hand rather than trying to tailor the offerings to his preferences. \u201cThe snack didn\u2019t blow me away. Ordering felt kind of like a job, and they sent samples I just wasn\u2019t interested in,\u201d Mr. Feit said, acknowledging that he is a picky eater. \u201cI ended up thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t have time for this.\u2019\u00a0\u201dFood businesses view the subscription services as a relatively inexpensive opportunity to get new products in front of consumers \u2014 and to get feedback and data fast.In fact, Williams Sonoma, Neiman Marcus and other retailers with high-end culinary businesses have long sold food subscriptions, allowing customers to send three months of, say, cheese as a gift.\u201cThe best example of how easy it is to get into this business is that I started Yumvelope in my freshman year of high school,\u201d said Sam Gold, who shut his subscription food company to start college this fall. \u201cThere\u2019s relatively little paperwork you have to do, and there are online tools that help you easily set up a recurring revenue type of business \u2014 in the first month, I had six subscribers and sales of $200.\u201dMr. Gold said would-be subscription box entrepreneurs underestimate the cost of acquiring and maintaining customers. Yumvelope\u2019s business plan, for instance, was to charge subscribers $21 a month for one, three or six months, with $7 going to buy products, $7 for shipping and a $7 profit for Mr. Gold.\u201cWith certain subscribers, that worked, but for a lot of other people, I would run a special where they would pay $14, which allowed me to break even \u2014 but then they\u2019d cancel after the first box,\u201d he said. \u201cIn theory, I had a 33 percent margin, which isn\u2019t bad, but in reality, that was rarely ever the case.\u201dThe real business in food subscriptions may be in the data they generate on what consumers like. \u201cSo much of the tech world is looking for a signal from all the noise, and these services offer incredibly interesting insights because of the feedback they get from consumers about the products in the boxes,\u201d Mr. Eakin of CircleUp said.Still, Mr. Jin said, \u201cThe international snack subscription model is still new to most people and the market is wide open and growing, so we have not had too much of an issue with needing to stand out to competitors right now.\u201dHe plans to build the Treats brand through strong customer service \u2014 Yelp abounds with criticism of subscription box companies\u2019 poor customer service \u2014 and the use of data and feedback to tailor boxes more individually.\u201cWe still have subscribers, but we\u2019re tweaking the model \u2014 for us, the margins are very thin on the subscription side,\u201d said Sam Davidson, one of the founders and the chief executive of Batch.About two-thirds of Batch\u2019s business was gift subscriptions, which didn\u2019t necessarily translate into continuing subscriptions, and competitors began offering boxes with tastes of Georgia or Portland, Ore., he said.Nonetheless, Batch was able to raise outside money last year, allowing it to open the retail store and revamp as a gift box company. \u201cFrom Day 1, we\u2019ve been about branding and marketing,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always intended Batch to be bigger than the box.\u201dAmanda Veraldi had her first taste of snack subscription during a trip to Cape Cod over a Memorial Day weekend a couple of years ago. When she got back to New York, she ordered a subscription from Graze, which is delivered to her office.\u201cI like that it\u2019s not a full bag, which helps with portion control,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, though, I bring the little popcorn snacks home because my boss doesn\u2019t like the smell of popcorn in the office.\u201dUnlike many other subscription snack services, which either buy or receive free products from food manufacturers, Graze\u2019s snacks are proprietary. Noshers choose eight snacks, most of which are high fiber, whole grain or free of artificial ingredients, of 100 to 150 calories each.Customers indicate which snacks they would like to try and which snacks they liked or didn\u2019t, as well as their dietary preferences and restrictions, and then an algorithm helps Graze tailor a box for them.\u201cThe more the customer interacts with Graze, the more we learn about them and can tailor products to them,\u201d said Paolo Wyatt, senior vice president for Graze\u2019s United States operations. \u201dThat makes a big difference in terms of getting them to stay around.\u201dGraze products are moving into stores, and the company says the insights it has collected from consumers over the years will help it there, too. \u201cWe have these technology development and data scientists on one side, and more classic consumer product goods marketers on the other, which adds up to an exciting business,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said.Mouth, the subscription business started by Mr. Kanarick, relies on novelty for its appeal to consumers. One subscription, for example, sends a bottle of \u201ccraft\u201d whiskey each month \u2014 in May, recipients received a bottle of Dark Horse Reserve Bourbon; in July, it was a bottle of Breuckelen Distilling 77 Local Rye and Corn Whiskey.Mr. Kanarick, a founder of Razorfish, one of the early successes to grow out of New York\u2019s \u201cSilicon Alley,\u201d began Mouth in early 2012 after observing an explosion of new food products from tiny independent producers around his neighborhood in Brooklyn.\u201cAt the time, we thought maybe this was a somewhat local phenomenon, a Brooklyn or New York thing, but almost immediately, one-third of our orders were coming from people in California,\u201d he said.Now, Mouth has a 6,000-square-foot warehouse in the Dumbo neighborhood, where it stocks almost 1,000 products. It sells 14 different food and beverage subscriptions for three, six and 12 months (except for its \u201cpregnancy\u201d subscription, which supplies a different pickle and chocolate for nine months).The company also has a retail liquor store and sells the products it stocks through its online store. In the works: a subscription that keeps on coming each month until the recipient cancels it, a strategy borrowed from Graze.\u201cWe have a fairly high rate of resubscription for individuals buying subscriptions for themselves,\u201d Mr. Kanarick said. \u201cFor people who get a subscription as a gift, it\u2019s a very different math.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Dive as Worries About Asia Reverberate", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeep the seatbelts on.Stock markets around the world tumbled Tuesday, dashing hopes that financial markets would calm down after two weeks of turbulence.Investors appear to be growing more nervous about the strength of the global economy. China released a weak report on manufacturing on Tuesday, and an influential international policy maker sounded a downbeat note on the outlook for Asian economies. In early trading on Wednesday, Chinese stocks again fell sharply, leaving the Shanghai composite index 40 percent lower than its recent peak. The price of contracts for the future delivery of oil, an indicator of the course of economic activity, also continued to drop in Asian trading.In the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index slid 58.33 points, or 2.96 percent on Tuesday. The benchmark is now 10.2 percent below its nominal high, putting it back in a correction \u2014 the Wall Street term for a decline of more than 10 percent from a peak level. The S.&P. 500 index is still 2.48 percent above the low it closed at last week.But the underlying ugliness of the action \u2014 only three stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose \u2014 suggested that the market could have further to drop.The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular market barometer, lost 469.68 points, or 2.84 percent, on Tuesday, to close at 16,058.35. The index is more than 12 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent on the day, and is down 11 percent from its recent high.Investors are now scouring the horizon for events that drive the markets up or down.Looming at the end of this week is the release of the United States jobs numbers. If the government figures on Friday show that employment growth has remained strong, investors may be encouraged that developments overseas will not do too much harm to the American economy. On the other hand, a robust jobs number may also lead investors to conclude that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, rather than wait longer.\u201cThe jobs numbers on Friday will be really important,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. \u201cIt will determine Fed policy one way or another.\u201d If the Fed decides to raise rates this month, it will most likely announce the move after monetary policy meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.The prospect of a September rise in interest rates has worried many economists and investors. In particular, they assert that the low level of inflation in the United States is a sign that the economy is still quite vulnerable to a slowdown.\u201cGiven the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased uncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary-policy makers to closely monitor and depend on incoming data,\u201d he said.Even if the Fed decides not to increase rates this month, further problems in China and elsewhere could make investors reluctant to jump back into the stock market.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Both outcomes, however, could affect countries with economies that rely heavily on exports. As a result, such countries may decide to further devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness with China. The high stakes of such rivalries were made clear on Tuesday when South Korea reported export figures for August that were well below expectations. In contrast with past periods of turbulence, this one has not so far spurred a fierce rally in the 10-year Treasury note, a safe-haven investment. Its yield fell slightly to 2.16 percent on Tuesday from 2.21 percent on Monday. Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday, the price of oil fell after a strong rally in recent days. The benchmark crude contract in New York declined $3.79, or 7.7 percent, to $45.41. Over time, a lower price might signal less demand for oil as economies slow.The Vix index, a measure of volatility in the S.&P. 500 that is often called Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, jumped 10 percent, but it is still well below last week\u2019s high.The major European indexes all closed the day 2 to 3 percent lower. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 2.4 percent. Advertisement"}

But already, Totokaelo is a $17 million business that, until this year, Ms. Wenger was directing out of a less-heralded fashion mecca: Seattle.Ms. Wenger, 38, founded her first store, Impulse, in Seattle in 2003 with a $20,000 loan from her grandparents. She sold local designers\u2019 clothes by consignment until demand outstripped what they could supply.\u201cAt first I learned how to sell clothes,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I had to learn how to style. Then I had to learn about fashion, because I started selling clothes quicker than the people could sew them. We are a true scrappy start-up.\u201dThe Seattle store continues, but the emphasis is now on New York, where Ms. Wenger moved last fall. The New York space is at once airy and esoteric. Light streams in from a skylight, and the top floors overlook one another around a central atrium; rooms are decorated like Bohemian apartments, with vintage rugs, potted succulents and ceramic jugs (the result of eBay searches for Asian and prehistoric pottery, Ms. Wenger said). Clothes are arranged, in part, by shade: There is the \u201cdesigner color\u201d room, a white room, a black room.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a store where I\u2019ve had enough space to do all black without it feeling heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here it totally works. It does not scare me, and it does not feel dark and gothy. It totally feels bright. I love that. I love that you can wear dark colors and not be a dark person.\u201dThe store will open Saturday flush with merchandise (besides the labels above, Ms. Wenger stocks newer ones like the Row and Vetements; a basement level is dedicated to men\u2019s wear). A new Totokaelo collection, inspired by \u201c\u201990s Yohji, Comme, Jil Sander\u201d and more moderately priced than some of Ms. Wenger\u2019s other stock ($450 trousers instead of $1,000 and higher ones by Mr. Yamamoto), will soon round out the offerings.\u201cI can\u2019t find the stuff I loved in the market \u2014 honestly, three years ago, I could,\u201d Ms. Wenger said. \u201cNow the world\u2019s going sexier.

{"Headline": "The Wild Day That Wasn\u2019t: Fed Avoids Tumult but Prolongs Uncertainty", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThursday could easily have been a wild day on Wall Street. If the Federal Reserve, at a long-anticipated meeting, had decided to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a steep sell-off in the stock market was possible. Conversely, if the Fed kept rates at their ultralow levels, investors might have cheered its commitment to easy money and gone on a buying spree.In the end, the Fed chose not to raise rates. Unexpectedly, the market closed slightly lower. The muted reaction may be welcome after the turbulence that roiled stock markets last month. And since investors were betting in certain markets that the Fed would not raise rates, it made some sense that they did not react strongly when they got what they expected.But the stock market\u2019s apparent meekness on such a big day may not be as encouraging as it looks. The Fed\u2019s decision not to raise rates, combined with statements made by Fed officials on Thursday, may have deepened investors\u2019 fears about the strength of the global economy \u2014 and raised new questions about the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to weakness around the world.\u201cWhat was problematic is that the Fed introduced a greater measure of concern about global issues,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. \u201cThe markets might be saying, \u2018What does the Fed know that we don\u2019t know?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the day down just 5.11 points, or 0.26 percent, at 1,990.20. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up as much as 194 points on Thursday afternoon, closed down 65.21 points, at 16,674.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended the day on a higher note, up 0.1 percent, to 4,893.95.Investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.217 percent, from 2.3 percent. The yield on the two-year Treasury plunged to 0.68 percent, from 0.81 percent.Expectations about Fed policy have long driven investors\u2019 decisions. But the influence of the Fed grew after the central bank introduced an enormous stimulus program after the financial crisis to lift the economy. Even though the economy did not bounce back strongly, investors were encouraged that the Fed would keep printing money until it got the results it was looking for. And with the Fed holding rates at their lows on Thursday, investors would seem to have reason to believe that stocks will keep moving higher as the Fed keeps its foot on the pedal.Inflation is well below the Fed\u2019s target in the United States, giving it some reason to delay raising rates \u2014 maybe even into next year, although it will have two more opportunities before this year ends. Whatever the precise timing, the Fed also appears to believe that with large developing countries like China flashing signs of weakness, it should keep rates at low levels to try to ease global financial conditions and insulate the United States economy from trouble overseas. One part of the statement released by the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee in particular indicated that higher rates might be a long time coming. \u201cThe committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term,\u201d the statement said.But the Fed\u2019s decision to hold off could be self-defeating. It might stoke fears rather than allay them, according to some analysts. And investors may start to believe that the Fed is in effect trying to set monetary policy for both the economies of the United States and China. That might be hard to pull off.\u201cChina is now the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said. \u201cIt\u2019s another source of uncertainty.\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, on Thursday appeared well aware of the difficulty of reacting to many different forces in the world economy and in global markets. She emphasized the existence of \u201ccrosscurrents\u201d in a press briefing. Some Fed watchers in the markets said that the Fed should have raised interest rates on Thursday \u2014 to dispel the uncertainty that they believe the central bank has started to create in the markets. Because it chose not to raise rates on Thursday, investors will be fretting for months about when the big day will actually arrive. \u201cIt leaves you no different than you were one minute before the announcement,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cMy countdown clock just restarted for 30 days.\u201dBut raising rates could have created far greater uncertainty, by roiling markets and hammering developing countries when they are vulnerable. Or, as Ms. Yellen put it, \u201cGiven the significant economic and financial interconnections between the United States and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYALL ACROSS THE GLOBE, companies, governments and society are scrambling to harness the energy and meet the needs of an aging global population. Consider a few of the ways the world is preparing for this longevity revolution:In the U.S., according to the Global Coalition on Aging,\u00b9 a drugstore chain noticed that aging customers, the core of its clientele and crucial for the company's profitability, tended to seek out older employees for assistance. To encourage would-be retirees to keep working, the chain offered those who spent their winters in warmer climes the opportunity to split their time between store locations and to work flexible hours.Also according to the Global Coalition on Aging,\u00b2 at a car plant in Bavaria, managers surveyed workers and consulted physical therapists and ergonomics experts about how to accommodate older employees. Keeping them happy and on the job was a necessity in Germany, which, according to The Guardian, has long been plagued by the lowest birth rate in Europe and has a dire shortage of younger workers. The changes the factory made weren't dramatic or futuristic\u2014softer wooden floors and chairs for breaks, adjustable worktables and orthopedic shoes\u2014but they had the intended effect. Absenteeism at the plant plummeted and productivity soared.The World Health Organization's honor roll of 210 Global Age-Friendly Cities and Communities\u00b3 includes Portland, Ore., and New York City. These cities meet a long list of criteria ranging from having plenty of public transportation to offering job opportunities, accessible spaces and socially inclusive policies for older residents. These attributes \"also make them better places for everyone to live,\" says Michael Hodin, executive director of the Global Coalition on Aging.In the U.S., that economy within an economy revolves around the 78 million people of the baby boom generation who are now surging into their retirement years. \"Boomers are the largest demographic force we have, in terms of volume, wealth, consumer spending and jobs,\" says Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer,\u00a0Bank of America Corporation's Global Wealth and Investment Management. \"And as they age, they're likely to spend more to maintain their active lifestyles than any previous generation in history.\"That spending, in the U.S. and around the globe, is expected to create a range of opportunities for investors, with stocks of forward-looking companies likely to emerge as appealing long-term investments. At the same time, all of us, across the generations, will need to come to grips with how this demographic megashift will affect our personal lives and finances.For example, if you are nearing retirement or are already there, you will need to think how to spend the extra years you can now expect to live\u201430 years more than in 1900\u2014and how to deploy your resources to finance them. Meanwhile, younger generations will want to start planning for lives that may be remarkably different from those of their parents. Careers that extend over five or six decades may require multiple phases of education and training, and paying for health care into old age will necessitate new financial solutions and sustainable models of care, says Hodin.\"History has never before experienced such a demographic shift, and no one is untouched by it,\" Hodin says. \"The aging of countries will literally transform how we, our children and our children's children live in the 21st century; everything will change.\"There have been worries that this demographic groundswell may change society for the worse, as a shrinking cohort of younger workers is called upon to carry the tax burden and other costs of supporting older generations. Yet older Americans are emerging as a tremendous economic asset. They are working longer, buying more goods and generally propelling economic growth. \"This generation has redefined industry after industry,\" says Lorna Sabbia, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"They have reinvented how we work and play, and they have no plans to slow down.\"And, says Coughlin, \"the real premium will be on sectors and companies that help us live how we want to live, even as we age. Previous generations were expected to age politely and cope with the aches and pains that defined retirement. Boomers are saying, 'I will not just live longer, I will live better.'\"Coughlin calls this \"stealth aging,\" with boomers seeking products and technologies that can minimize impairments associated with advancing years. \"They may no longer be young, but they perceive themselves to be perennially youthful,\" he says. \"Any product that is defined as being for an old person, generally speaking, is rejected.\" Looking for companies that get it right, providing products and services that benefit older Americans without seeming to, could be part of an effective investment strategy.Longevity has not only increased life spans but has also granted many more years of good health. Forty-two percent of people age 65 to 69 and 33% age 75 to 79 say they are in excellent or very good health, according to a study published in the November 17, 2013, issue of the Journals of Gerontology. And 56% of Americans 85 and older say they have no limitations on their ability to work or to live their lives. At the same time, however, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and debilitating conditions such as Huntington's disease is rising as the population ages, and two-thirds of people past age 65 say they must cope with multiple chronic illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Transcript of videoThose apparently conflicting trends\u2014of a population that still feels young yet is also beginning to suffer inevitable consequences of getting older\u2014hint at the enormous diversity of the boomer generation and at the breadth of products and services being developed to serve its needs.Coughlin expects many in this demographic group to spend their later years in \"smart\" homes in which technology will control everything from appliances and sprinkler systems to bathrooms that serve as \"centers of health and well-being\" equipped with mirrors that analyze skin conditions and devices that remind you to take your medications. Service robots, already in use in Japan, will do the housework and other chores and even provide \"companionship\" for a generation increasingly able to \"age in place,\" according to Larry Polivka, director of the Claude Pepper Center at Florida State University. Pioneering companies offering advanced technological solutions could profit.Meanwhile, anti-aging treatments, biotechnology start-ups focused on regenerative medicine, and telemedicine applications that let physicians and families monitor health data from older people living independently at home all are areas of rapid development. The medical device industry is likely to flourish as ever more intricate technology helps the country compensate for an expected shortage of doctors, says Christopher J. Wolfe, chief investment officer, Portfolio Solutions, Private Banking and Investment Group \u00a0and Institutional at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. \"Devices will send blood pressure readings and other data to physicians in real time, greatly reducing the need for office visits and waiting rooms,\" he says. \"Technology is going to change the definition of what's normal in health care practice.\"Other companies are altering products to fit the needs of older consumers, and then finding that the broader market also welcomes changes that vary from the futuristic to the seemingly mundane\u2014ranging not only from cars that warn of impending collisions and park themselves but also to hotels undergoing renovations to accommodate older travelers with disabilities. The most promising stocks in the travel and leisure industries, for example, will come from companies offering this demographic group unique adventures and educational opportunities, adds Wolfe.The need for home health workers and assisted-living facilities is also expected to\u00a0mushroom, helping people to live independently for many years. The number of people in nursing homes is already declining, says Polivka, who predicts dramatic changes in those facilities as they are replaced by what he describes as the \"greenhouse model.\" \"People will live in units of four to 10 beds that provide a more normal and much less regimented environment,\" Polivka says. Due to baby boomers' demands for respect and control over their lives, large chains that meet this mandate could separate themselves from their peers. This could create a sector that should provide increasing investment opportunities as the longevity revolution gains momentum.As robust and multifaceted as the longevity economy is already proving to be, the challenges of today's shifting demographic reality are complex and daunting. Consider, for example, the older generation's inclination to stay on the job.According to a 2013 Merrill Lynch retirement study, 71% of pre-retirees expect to work during their retirement years and hope to find jobs that offer flexible hours. Entrepreneurism among older people is also projected to rise; already, people in their 50s and 60s start nearly twice the number of companies as those launched by twentysomethings, according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studies American entrepreneurism.The longer older Americans keep working, however, the larger the roadblock they may put in the way of younger workers trying to move up to senior positions in their fields. \"Older workers have one of the lowest unemployment rates of any group, which is good for them,\" Wolfe says. But for workers in their twenties, thirties and forties, the delay in reaching upper pay levels may complicate their ability to prepare for their own longevity bonus.Others believe such worries may be mitigated by other parts of the longevity economy. \"There was a time when people feared that having women in the workforce would take jobs away from men,\" says Hodin. \"That didn't happen, and female workers instead added trillions of dollars to the economy. The same thing has to happen with older Americans\"\u2014that is, they need to continue to fuel economic growth \u2014 \"or our social-insurance programs will become fiscally unsustainable.\"What will happen to Social Security and Medicare as the flood of baby boomers collects benefits? \"The mathematics are that the number of people leaving the workforce will be greater than the number of young people coming into it,\" says Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. \"Thus, the tax base will shrink while government spending is expanding, which in the absence of fiscal reform could create a certain amount of 'social insecurity.'\"Indeed, in 1935, when the U.S. established 65 as the minimum age for drawing Social Security benefits, the average life expectancy was 65 for women and only 62 for men, says Woody Carlson, the Charles B. Nam Professor in Sociology of Population at Florida State University's Center for Demography and Population Health. \"Today, it's pushing 80,\" Carlson says. \"If the retirement age increased along with life expectancy, people would now retire at 75.\"Still, raising the age at which people can begin receiving Social Security benefits by even a year or two would be politically dicey, and in the short term, the U.S. will face the challenge of not having enough workers from the much smaller Generation X to support the millions of baby boomers moving into retirement. \"But the U.S. has what no other country in the world has\u2014a new generation that is even larger than the boomer generation,\" says Carlson. There are approximately 90 million people born between 1983 and 2001 who are living in the U.S.\u2014 children of the boomers and of immigrants\u2014compared with 78 million baby boomers. \"In Germany, this cohort is called the 'disappearing generation,' and that country is closing schools and laying off teachers because there are no kids,\" says Carlson. \"The U.S. has plenty of kids, and once they enter the labor force, they will be very good for the economy.\"Until then, reforms of Social Security and Medicare and the dynamism and adaptability of the American economy will see the country through the graying of the baby boomers. \"Our economy is flexible and movable, and we have a diverse labor force and steady immigration,\" says Hyzy. In the end, moreover, ruminations about whether the longevity miracle and having a fifth of the U.S. population over age 65 by 2050 will have a positive or negative impact are almost beside the point. The wave is upon us already, and it is changing the world. \"Today is not only the first day of the rest of our lives,\" says Coughlin. \"It's also the first day of the future.\"Longevity isn't just reshaping the whole world. It's changing individual retirement needs.Statistically speaking, people who are in or nearing traditional \"retirement age\" can expect to live longer than any previous generation. Whereas earlier generations could rely on savings, company pensions and Social Security, you now must plan virtually every aspect of your own retirement.\"Longevity is a miracle, but it's also people's biggest fear,\" says Lorna Sabbia, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"It's on their shoulders to put all this together.\"Just aiming to reach a certain savings figure can't begin to meet all of the needs and desires that together will comprise a fulfilling retirement\u2014including providing for health security, making key decisions on where to live and how best to provide a legacy for one's family and for charitable causes. With specific goals in mind, it is possible to determine appropriate strategies for each of them.Investments will be essential, but so will other kinds of assets. Starting a new career or fulfilling an entrepreneurial dream, for example, could provide new income to augment one's savings. \"Matching your assets against your goals reveals choices and possible trade-offs.\" Could a more modest retirement home than the one you previously envisioned help fulfill a goal of seeing the world? Could working for a couple of years longer than planned help ease some concerns about long-term care, or outliving one's assets?An ongoing conversationExplore your goalsWhat's your investment personality?Global Wealth & Investment Management is a division of Bank of America Corporation (\u201cBofA Corp.\u201d).

{"Headline": "Price of Crude Oil Tumbles After Soaring for 3 Days", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 After three days of spiking oil prices, a barrel of crude tumbled back nearly 8 percent on Tuesday, renewing despair in the oil patch. At the same time, ConocoPhillips announced it was cutting its global work force by 10 percent.The two events were not directly linked, but they combined to reinforce the widespread notion around the oil fields and corporate headquarters in cities like Houston and Oklahoma City that the declining fortunes of the industry will not reverse anytime soon.\u201cOur industry is undergoing a dramatic downturn,\u201d Daren Beaudo, a ConocoPhillips spokesman, said in an email statement. \u201cAs we have assessed the implications of lower prices on our business, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision that work force reductions will be necessary.\u201dThe company will cut 1,800 employees, most of them in North America. More than 500 of ConocoPhillips\u2019s 3,750 employees in Houston, the company\u2019s base, will be cut, and another 400 will lose their jobs in Canada. The company had already cut 1,000 jobs this year. The job cuts are part of a general restructuring that includes reductions in future deepwater exploration.Before the ConocoPhillips announcement, at least 176,000 oil workers had lost their jobs globally since 2014, according to Swift Worldwide Resources, an oil and gas recruitment agency.There have been a scattering of bankruptcies in the industry, and a growing number of companies have already suspended their dividends or sold off assets at bargain-basement prices to pay interest on their debts.Oil markets have been whipsawed in recent days by contradictory reports.On Monday, a commentary accompanying an OPEC market report suggested that the cartel was willing to sit down with non-OPEC producers to shore up prices. With Venezuela already talking to Russia about how to stabilize the market, some traders concluded that perhaps Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were rethinking their strategy of pumping more oil even as prices were falling.At the same time, data released by the Energy Department this week showed that domestic oil production may have peaked at 9.6 million barrels a day in April and has since fallen by more than 300,000 barrels a day. If that trend were to continue, a drop of as much as a million barrels a day of American production could come off the global market by late next year, relieving the current glut.Wall Street analysts treated the recent spike in oil prices \u2014 which surpassed 20 percent over the three trading days from last Thursday through Monday \u2014 with caution if not derision.Several warned that there was no sign that Saudi Arabia was about to cut production, and said that traders were being motivated more by fear than reasonable analysis.\u201cSharp gains over the past three trading sessions were driven by a combination of short covering and chart readers again looking to call a bottom falsely,\u201d according to a Citi Research investment note this week.The American benchmark price for oil dropped 7.7 percent, to $45.41 a barrel on Tuesday. The global benchmark fell 8.5 percent, to $49.56 a barrel. Both are less than half the levels of last summer.Many analysts say that the price of crude could drop another $10 in the short term, especially if the Chinese economy continues to slow. That would be good for consumers, who could see the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline decline to $2 in many parts of the country over the next few months.But at current prices, the glut is probably not sustainable. Much of the oil produced around the world is no longer profitable \u2014 particularly in the Canadian oil sands and deepwater fields around the Western Hemisphere and Africa.Already, companies are dropping their investments in long-range projects, and recent auctions for offshore fields held in Mexico and the United States have attracted little interest.A sharp drop in drilling in American shale fields has not led to a significant reduction in production. But that is likely to change in the coming months, since the productivity of the typical shale oil well declines by more than 60 percent after its first year in production.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Parched WestCADIZ, Calif. \u2014 Gazing out of a turboprop high above his company\u2019s main asset \u2014 34,000 acres in the Mojave Desert with billions of gallons of fresh water locked deep below the sagebrush-dotted land \u2014 Scott Slater paints a lush picture that has enticed a hardy band of investors for a quarter-century.But tapping cash, as opposed to actual water, has never been a problem for Cadiz. \u201cI think there\u2019s plenty of money out there,\u201d Mr. Slater said.Real profits may be nearly as scarce as snow in the High Sierra, but Wall Street, as it is wont to do, smells profit as California endures its worst drought in decades.\u201cInvesting in the water industry is one of the great opportunities for the coming decades,\u201d said Matthew J. Diserio of Water Asset Management, a New York firm that is a major backer of Cadiz. \u201cWater is the scarce resource that will define the 21st century, much like plentiful oil defined the last century.\u201dSo far, though, this veritable Gold Rush has mostly turned up fool\u2019s gold.Over the last decade, Cadiz has accrued $185 million in losses, and revenue from the lemon groves and vineyards it owns in the Mojave has added up to only a trickle: $7.1 million total since 2005.To develop the project, the company burns through $10 million to $20 million annually, paying for a never-ending battle in courthouses and conference rooms across California to win make-or-break government permits and to cover the salaries of its 10 full-time employees.Cadiz has generated that money by borrowing and regularly issuing more shares, prompting skeptics to wonder if it will ever actually deliver any water, much less any profits.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough game,\u201d said John Dickerson, chief executive of Summit Global Management, a 20-year-old San Diego firm that invests in water infrastructure companies, local water suppliers and water rights, both in the United States and overseas.\u201cCadiz has promoted the dream and for years Wall Street has pumped optimistic paper water for Cadiz,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now the hard question for them is, Where is your real water and when can we drink it?\u201dOther water ventures have also promised more than they have been able to deliver, at least so far. Obstacles abound in the forms of skeptical regulators, wary customers and implacably opposed environmental groups.The drought, however, hasn\u2019t softened local opposition to private players like Cadiz or Poseidon entering California\u2019s water market. A main reason is money.After Poseidon\u2019s new plant begins producing desalinated water late this year, the monthly water bill for a typical consumer in the San Diego area will rise by about $5, to $80, according to the San Diego County Water Authority.Located on the grounds of a power plant in Carlsbad facing the Pacific Ocean, the facility should produce as much as 50 million gallons of drinking water a day, if not more, expanding the region\u2019s water supply nearly 10 percent.Nonetheless, for Adam Scow, California director of Food and Water Watch, a nonprofit environmental group that opposes the desalination project, any private control over the water supply is too much.\u201cWater is a public trust, and it shouldn\u2019t be privatized,\u201d Mr. Scow said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be managed for the benefit of a few people like Poseidon\u2019s investors. The rates are unjustified.\u201dPoseidon officials reject arguments from critics like Mr. Scow that they are taking advantage of consumers.\u201cThe Carlsbad desalination project is a true public-private partnership,\u201d said Andrew Kingman, executive vice president at Poseidon Water. \u201cPoseidon\u2019s role in the project is that of a service provider. The Water Authority doesn\u2019t have any payment obligations for the water until it is converted and delivered, and thereafter has full control over its use.\u201dIndeed, despite fears that Wall Street is making money off the drought, so far it has mainly been Poseidon\u2019s investors who have been on the losing end. The company\u2019s first return on its investment is not expected until next year, after years on the drawing board. A similar Poseidon project up the coast in Huntington Beach is still mired in the permitting process.\u201cIt took more than a decade of struggle to get the Poseidon project permitted, not the kind of experience to make for happy investors,\u201d Mr. Dickerson said. \u201cThis may well discourage potential investors in future desalination projects in California.\u201dBut for those with a long enough time horizon, water may ultimately prove to be a good investment.\u201cWater has been taken for granted, but reliable access is no longer guaranteed,\u201d said Disque D. Deane Jr., a Wall Street veteran who runs Water Asset Management with Mr. Diserio. \u201cIt will be seen as an asset class that will be allocated in portfolios like health care stocks or energy or real estate.\u201dTheir firm now oversees more than $500 million for pension plans, sovereign funds and wealthy families, and their flagship fund has generally outperformed global stock market benchmarks since inception in 2006. Assets at Impax Asset Management, a London-based firm that also focuses on water, have doubled to $1.8 billion over the last two years.While some projects may be more far-fetched than others, experts involved in the business insist there\u2019s nothing wrong with making a profit selling water.\u201cIt takes money to process, treat and move water, but now water itself is becoming increasingly valuable in the West,\u201d said Steve Maxwell, a veteran industry consultant who is based in Boulder, Colo.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference whether it\u2019s a public agency or a private company that manages your water, the prices are going up,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of municipal inefficiency or corporate greed. It\u2019s because we\u2019re running out of water.\u201dMany investors are looking for less risky ways to make money in the water business. Rather than wade into bruising battles over water rights or developing new supplies only to face accusations of trying to profit off the drought, investors like Simon Gottelier of Impax are focusing on companies that supply infrastructure to water utilities and industrial users, not the water itself.\u201cAs long-term investors focused on managing a \u2018sleep at night\u2019 fund, we are reticent about water rights companies because of how emotive the issue can be,\u201d Mr. Gottelier said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make investments in companies that become a subject of ire from farmers or generate headlines.\u201dFor Impax, that means there is appeal in stocks like Xylem, a maker of pumps, filtration equipment, and water treatment and testing supplies. Other Impax holdings might include makers of reverse osmosis membranes, like those at the heart of Poseidon\u2019s new desalination plant, which Mr. Gottelier visited in June.He sees California\u2019s water shortage not just as a driver of demand for the individual companies in his portfolio, but also as a spur to individuals and institutions wanting in on the water trade but not ready for moonshots like Cadiz.\u201cThere has been a dramatic increase in real and potential investor appetite,\u201d Mr. Gottelier said. Much of the cash flowing into Impax is from institutional clients in Europe, where for-profit water systems have a long history, in contrast to the United States.Back in the Mojave, in a trailer alongside a sun-baked airstrip built by Cadiz, Mr. Slater likes to show visitors a video of what appears to be an underground river 400 feet below the sand and sagebrush.

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Decision on Rates Rattles Some Global Markets", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global markets were largely down on Friday after the United States Federal Reserve signaled fresh concerns over slowing growth in China and other emerging markets.The Fed\u2019s decision weighed on global markets Friday, and Wall Street opened lower as well after edging down modestly the day before.Stocks in Japan closed 2 percent lower, ending a three-day rally. Shanghai stocks see-sawed between small gains and losses, closing up 0.4 percent after a week of more volatile swings.Markets in Europe had fallen sharply by early afternoon, with the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chip stocks, off about 3.2 percent. In London, the FTSE 100 was down 1.8 percent, while the CAC 40 index in Paris had slipped 3.12. The DAX index in Frankfurt was also down 3.3 percent.In early trading in New York, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index was 1.1 percent lower, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4 percent, and Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 percent.The slowing growth in China, along with the weakness in emerging market economies like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, has created a rout in global commodity prices, as demand for raw materials like oil, industrial metals and iron ore have slumped. This has tempered inflation around the world, as well as in the United States.\u201cThese developments may restrain U.S. economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\u201d Ms. Yellen added.Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong, said that the Fed postponed a rate increase largely because \u201cjitters\u201d from China had \u201cspread far and wide.\u201d\u201cUltimately, the drags from China\u2019s slowdown will only delay rate hikes by the Fed, rather than prevent the Fed tightening its stance altogether,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.The troubled outlook for emerging market nations has been a sharp contrast to the building strength of the American economy. And while ultralow interest rates have been blamed in recent years for adding froth to bubbly markets, the recovery in the six years since the global financial crisis has been tangible for the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not just fantasy money coming from the Fed \u2014 there are real jobs and profits being created, there\u2019s real economic growth,\u201d said Robert P. Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust, a Chicago-based investment firm.\u201cThis is not just the drug of monetary easing making the patient better \u2014 the patient is getting better through real rehabilitation,\u201d he added.At the other end of the spectrum is China, where the economy is expected to grow this year at its slowest pace in a quarter-century. The economy is sputtering because of a sharp downturn in manufacturing and housing construction, previously key engines of growth. Chinese officials have responded in recent months with a flurry of interest rate cuts and billions of dollars in investment in new infrastructure, but the economy continues to decelerate.The effects are being felt in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. Such countries rode the commodities boom as they fed demand from China for materials like iron ore, coal and edible oils.The situation has reversed sharply in the past year. And the diminished growth prospects have led to rising outflows of funds and falling exchange rates in many emerging markets.A weaker currency tends to lift a country\u2019s exports, making overseas shipments cheaper in dollar terms. But it provides little advantage when it becomes the general trend.In Asia, for example, many countries that rely on exports \u201cform part of the same cross-border supply chain, making different parts or components of one final product that\u2019s shipped out of China a couple of months later,\u201d said Christian de Guzman, a senior analyst in the sovereign risk group at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in Singapore.For these countries, he added, \u201cit\u2019s hard to gain advantage from a depreciated local currency because they\u2019ve all depreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Williams shareholders can choose to receive Energy Transfer stock or cash in exchange for the transaction. Both companies\u2019 stocks traded slightly lower before the market opened.The deal is a coup for Energy Transfer, built by billionaire Kelcy L. Warren, whose earlier $48 billion takeover bid for Williams was rejected in June. At the time, Williams said the bid was too low and it was focused on acquiring its subsidiary, Williams Partners, for $14 billion.Monday\u2019s deal terminates the acquisition of Williams Partners, meaning the Williams Companies will pay a $428 million breakup fee, and the subsidiary will keep its name and headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Energy Transfer and Williams, when combined, will operate more than 100,000 miles of oil and natural gas pipelines. The larger scale could help the company better deal with a plunge in energy prices that has plagued the stock of both companies.\u201dAs a combined company, we will have enhanced prospects for growth, be better able to connect to more diverse markets, and have more stability in an environment of low commodity prices,\u201d Alan Armstrong, the chief executive of Williams, said in the statement.The companies expect the transaction, which was approved by both boards, will be completed in the first half of 2016. Energy Transfer said the deal would be accretive to cash flow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friendship Between Putin and Xi Becomes Strained as Economies Falter", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Putin has enjoyed basking in the stature of Mr. Xi, who leads one of the world\u2019s largest economies. But with the recent stock market turmoil in China and the slowest economic growth in a quarter-century, Beijing will be unable to provide the ballast that Mr. Putin has sought against economic sanctions imposed on Russia by Europe and the United States after its annexation of Crimea, not to mention plummeting oil prices worldwide.\u201cRussia was dependent on China growing and driving the demand for its commodities: oil, gas and minerals,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a Russia specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cChina was an alternative to Europe.\u201dBut the price was never formally announced, and it is possible that with plunging energy prices, the deal will have to be renegotiated, said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the natural gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Britain. The Chinese wanted the gas for its depressed northeast region, and the Russians had started to prepare for its delivery, but there has been only limited drilling, he said.Further complicating that deal is Russia\u2019s inability to pay for the pipelines, and the question of whether China needs the Russian gas badly enough to finance their construction, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cChina will have to pay for the construction, one way or another, given Russia\u2019s financial crunch,\u201d he said.A Chinese expert on Russia, who is usually sanguine about the relationship with Moscow, said that the deal had also run into pricing problems. \u201cThe negotiations face many difficulties due to the plunge in the price of gas,\u201d said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cWe have to recalculate all the costs and try to push for a price cut.\u201dIn Moscow, similarly, optimism about China substantially helping Russia out of its economic problems has faded.\u201cThe big hope that China is going to provide a lifeline to sustain Russia through the sanctions and the falling oil price is not working,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, an analyst of Russian-Chinese relations at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\u201cIt is a symbolic relationship \u2014 with a small, volatile economic base,\u201d he said. The Kremlin elite was \u201cdisappointed that nothing has materialized as quickly as the Russians hoped.\u201dRussian demand for Chinese manufactured goods is down 40 percent, and for clothing 50 percent, from this time last year, Mr. Gabuev said. The volatile ruble has made Chinese investors wary, and attempts to get the countries\u2019 banking sectors to work together have not borne much fruit, he added.Because the goal of $100 billion in trade with China looks impossible to reach in 2015, the $200 billion the countries had projected by 2020 might also prove overly optimistic, Russian officials say.The big energy deals are not the only victim of the economic slowdowns.Their apparent mutual admiration has been all the more noticeable because of the long and rocky relationship during the Cold War between Communist China and the Soviet Union, when the countries were ostensibly on the same side but nearly came to a nuclear showdown in 1969 over a border war. The tenure of Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the helm of the Soviet Union sent shudders through the Chinese Communist Party, and still does.\u201cThere has never been a close relationship until recently,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThe success of China has bred the interest of Russia.\u201d Even though Chinese growth was slowing, China still seemed \u201cbrighter\u201d to the Russians relative to the downswings in Europe and Ukraine and to their own economic problems, she said.The sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine also pushed the two countries closer.Both leaders boast that they have elevated the ties between their countries to a strategic relationship; Russia and China recently held joint naval exercises in the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. And they have joined at the United Nations in opposing American initiatives in Libya and Syria, and have held similar views on Iran.But there are limits to their strategic interests. China has been wary of Russia\u2019s moves in Crimea and particularly in Ukraine, where Beijing has commercial and military investments. It also worries that Crimea\u2019s secession from Ukraine might set a precedent for Chinese territories such as Tibet or Xinjiang or for the world to recognize Taiwan\u2019s de facto independence.In Central Asia, they are more competitors than cooperative friends, especially as China buys energy from countries that have been in Russia\u2019s traditional sphere of influence, energy that China could, if it wanted, purchase from Russia.The Obama administration has responded to the friendship with a certain nonchalance, arguing that Russia will inevitably be a liability to China, particularly in hard economic times.In the words of Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cWashington seems to think Putin is more burden than boon to Beijing.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Proposes Cap on Patients\u2019 Drug Costs as Bernie Sanders Pushes His Plan", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Republican candidates for the White House want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and generally oppose interfering with the drug industry, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are competing fiercely with each other to press for greater competition and new regulations to rein in pharmaceutical companies. Mrs. Clinton announced her patient spending cap as part of a plan that includes requiring most drug makers to spend a defined portion of their profits on research and development, ending tax breaks for pharmaceutical advertising and allowing Americans to import lower-priced drugs from other countries.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where people are being asked to pay not just hundreds but thousands of dollars for a single pill,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who laid out her proposals at a forum in Iowa, where she and Mr. Sanders are running closely in opinion polls for the first-in-the-nation caucuses. \u201cThat is not the way the market is supposed to work. That is bad actors making a fortune off of people\u2019s misfortune.\u201dOn Tuesday, the index fell more modestly but had recovered somewhat by the end of the day. Wall Street analysts said that many of the proposals were unlikely to be enacted with Republicans controlling Congress, even if Mrs. Clinton became president.\u201cBottom line is, politically this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Terry Haines, Washington analyst for the investment bank Evercore ISI, told clients on a webcast.The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the country\u2019s leading drug makers, said in a statement that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan would \u201cturn back the clock on medical innovation.\u201d\u201cThese sweeping and far-reaching proposals would restrict patients\u2019 access to medicines, result in fewer new treatments for patients, cost countless jobs across the country and erode our nation\u2019s standing as the world leader in biomedical innovation,\u201d the statement said.Some health economists warned that her new government mandate for company spending on medical research could create perverse incentives that could raise instead of lower the costs of developing drugs.\u201cThis is an astonishingly na\u00efve approach,\u201d Amitabh Chandra, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, said in an email. He argued that the plan could encourage wasteful research spending without necessarily doing much about the prices charged for medications.Several provisions in the plan are designed to change the way pharmaceutical companies structure their businesses. The proposal to establish a set ratio between revenue and research spending, and another that would eliminate the tax deductibility of drug marketing expenses, are clearly aimed at directing the companies to invest more heavily in research than selling their products.\u201cHow can you get the focus to be more on research and less on getting people to take medicines they don\u2019t need?\u201d asked David Cutler, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who has advised the Obama administration. He described the Clinton plan as \u201cimperfect\u201d but expected that it would shift drug company priorities.Other parts of her plan were focused more narrowly on drug prices. One would reduce the amount of time a biologic drug could keep exclusivity, before cheaper copycat products could enter the market. Biologic drugs are different from typical medicines, because they are manufactured from living cells instead of chemicals. That provision would not affect the prices of biologic drugs when they first enter the market, but would limit the drug makers\u2019 period of monopoly pricing.Like Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton also endorses allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug makers for discounts; in the current system, competing private insurers each secure their own prices.Federal government data shows that drug spending rose substantially in 2014, after four relatively flat years.That means that more Americans are absorbing the cost of expensive drugs, and many are having difficulty affording the medicines.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan is aimed at addressing both sides of that equation, by trying to discourage drug companies from overcharging for their products while preventing insurance companies from passing along those high prices to consumers.Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has urged a vast governmental shift in health care, proposing a Medicare-for-all single-payer insurance system. Such an idea has never gained traction in Congress, leading Mr. Sanders to also pursue a separate strategy of trying to lower drug prices.\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe time is long overdue for Congress to listen to the needs of the American people and not the enormously profitable pharmaceutical industry.\u201dConcerns about the cost of prescription drugs cross party lines, polls show, but the Republican presidential candidates have put forward fewer ideas to address it. One, Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said in an interview on Tuesday that he opposed \u201ca whole new rash of regulations.\u201d\u201cEvery regulation costs money in terms of goods and services, and who gets hit disproportionately with those costs? People who are already struggling to pay,\u201d Mr. Carson said. Andrew Pollack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scrutiny of Security Start-Ups May Signal Shift in Venture Funding", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A funny thing happened to Orion Hindawi while he was raising $120 million for his cybersecurity start-up last month: Investors asked him about profits.That sudden dose of skepticism about cybersecurity start-ups, which as a group recorded record investments last year, may be a harbinger of change across the entire technology sector. With global stock markets struggling, investors may be ready to move away from the focus on growth over profits of the last few years.If that shift proves to be more than a blip, it will represent a sharp turnabout. Cybersecurity entrepreneurs in recent years have had an easy time raising money as breaches at the nation\u2019s largest companies and government agencies have become front-page news.In 2014, American venture capitalists poured $1.77 billion, a record amount, into private security start-ups, topping the previous record of $1.62 billion invested in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.And there are too many companies trying to do the same thing: identify \u201canomalous\u201d behavior on computer networks and respond to attacks in real time, Mr. Cowan said.If interest from venture firms is any indication, Tanium must still be sexy. The Emeryville, Calif., company\u2019s technology can test the millions of computers that are attached to corporate networks, ask them questions, and patch them or shut them down in seconds, if need be.Tanium has been profitable since shortly after it started working with customers in 2012 (it was founded in 2007). Mr. Hindawi and his father, David, were not initially interested in raising venture capital, but the value Andreessen Horowitz was willing to put on their company and the business connections the venture firm could provide were too good to ignore.Still, Mr. Hindawi said he was surprised that venture capitalists were willing to place a $900 million valuation on a young company without so much as a glance at revenue or margin.\u201cUp until a year ago, nobody cared that we were cash flow positive,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of those things factored in. They basically said, \u2018We don\u2019t really care. What\u2019s the growth rate?\u2019\u201dThe diligence he encountered during the company\u2019s latest funding round was almost a relief, he said, maybe an indication that some semblance of sobriety had returned to tech funding.But it may be just a semblance. Mr. Hindawi turned away $400 million in cash offers in the latest round. The investors who made the cut \u2014 Institutional Venture Partners, TPG Growth and T. Rowe Price \u2014 valued Tanium at $3.5 billion, nearly four times the $900 million valuation it received last year and double the $1.75 billion valuation that Andreessen Horowitz gave it last March, according to two people familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms were confidential.Tanium did not need the cash, Mr. Hindawi conceded, but he chose to raise money now, in part, because word that he had recently turned down an acquisition offer sent investors flocking to the company\u2019s door \u2014 and a quarter-billion dollars in the bank would help it survive if a downturn hit.\u201cI never want to raise money again,\u201d Mr. Hindawi said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a market downturn or a \u2018black swan\u2019 occurs, I want to make sure we cross that bar.\u201dSaving up cash from private investors may also be wise because the public markets have not been kind to security companies lately.Those slides could continue with recent market volatility. On Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent for the day. It recovered on Wednesday, but is still down 9 percent from its recent high in July. The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular gauge of the broader market, has tumbled 10 percent since July.With the risk of a downturn growing, Tanium is not the only security start-up putting money away for a rainy day. Crowdstrike, which runs cyberthreats through a powerful cloud computing system, received $100 million from Google Capital in July, for example.Mr. Kurtz said he learned from the dot-com crash that it is better to give up a little ownership stake in return for investment dollars that can turn into a safety cushion if business turns bad.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a company go out of business from dilution, but I have seen companies go out of business because they didn\u2019t raise enough money,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the Google entity that gave $100 million to Crowdstrike in July. It was Google Capital, not Google Ventures.Because of an editing error, an article last Thursday about rising skepticism among venture capital firms about investing in online security start-ups misidentified a fund that invested in one such start-up, Tanium. It is TPG Growth, not TPG Capital.Advertisement"}

The S.&P. 500 index is still 2.48 percent above the low it closed at last week.But the underlying ugliness of the action \u2014 only three stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose \u2014 suggested that the market could have further to drop.The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular market barometer, lost 469.68 points, or 2.84 percent, on Tuesday, to close at 16,058.35. The index is more than 12 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent on the day, and is down 11 percent from its recent high.Investors are now scouring the horizon for events that drive the markets up or down.Looming at the end of this week is the release of the United States jobs numbers. If the government figures on Friday show that employment growth has remained strong, investors may be encouraged that developments overseas will not do too much harm to the American economy. On the other hand, a robust jobs number may also lead investors to conclude that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, rather than wait longer.\u201cThe jobs numbers on Friday will be really important,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. \u201cIt will determine Fed policy one way or another.\u201d If the Fed decides to raise rates this month, it will most likely announce the move after monetary policy meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.The prospect of a September rise in interest rates has worried many economists and investors. In particular, they assert that the low level of inflation in the United States is a sign that the economy is still quite vulnerable to a slowdown.\u201cGiven the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased uncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary-policy makers to closely monitor and depend on incoming data,\u201d he said.Even if the Fed decides not to increase rates this month, further problems in China and elsewhere could make investors reluctant to jump back into the stock market.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Both outcomes, however, could affect countries with economies that rely heavily on exports. As a result, such countries may decide to further devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness with China. The high stakes of such rivalries were made clear on Tuesday when South Korea reported export figures for August that were well below expectations. In contrast with past periods of turbulence, this one has not so far spurred a fierce rally in the 10-year Treasury note, a safe-haven investment. Its yield fell slightly to 2.16 percent on Tuesday from 2.21 percent on Monday. Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday, the price of oil fell after a strong rally in recent days. The benchmark crude contract in New York declined $3.79, or 7.7 percent, to $45.41. Over time, a lower price might signal less demand for oil as economies slow.The Vix index, a measure of volatility in the S.&P. 500 that is often called Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, jumped 10 percent, but it is still well below last week\u2019s high.The major European indexes all closed the day 2 to 3 percent lower. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 2.4 percent. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caterpillar to Cut Up to 10,000 Jobs, Citing Falling Demand", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors already nervous about prospects for global growth reacted with dismay to the Caterpillar disclosure, sending shares in the company, one of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, down 6.3 percent for the day. Earlier Thursday, the Dow was down more than 1 percent but recovered some ground, closing lower by about 78 points, or 0.5 percent. Exchanges in Europe closed down roughly 2 percent.Although Caterpillar is affected more severely than most companies because mining businesses and other commodity producers are among its main customers, its problems illustrate the economic difficulties facing many multinationals.\u201cWe are facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors \u2014 namely in mining and energy,\u201d said Douglas R. Oberhelman, Caterpillar\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve already made substantial adjustments as these market conditions have emerged, we are taking even more decisive actions now.\u201dMost of the initial reductions will be among salaried workers and management, the bulk of them in United States, rather than the hourly work force, the company said. Along with layoffs, Caterpillar will look to reduce its manufacturing footprint and is considering closings or consolidations at more than 20 plants worldwide.In an op-ed article in The Peoria Journal Star, Mr. Oberhelman reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to the town but warned that the layoffs would be sizable.\u201cBecause Peoria is our global headquarters and we have the largest concentration of employees in Illinois, the impact here will be significant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeoria has been Caterpillar\u2019s home for 90 years and we know this is especially difficult and hard for our local employees, families and communities.\u201dThe company also reduced its outlook for revenue in 2015 by $1 billion, to $48 billion. That is a decline of more than 25 percent from four years ago, when surging commodity prices and the boom in Asia fueled very strong results.Caterpillar has been aggressive about cutting jobs and reducing costs since then. Still, the scale of its announcement on Thursday surprised investors.\u201cSeveral of the key industries we serve \u2014 including mining, oil and gas, construction and rail \u2014 have a long history of substantial cyclicality,\u201d Mr. Oberhelman said. \u201cWhile they are the right businesses to be in for the long term, we have to manage through what can be considerable and sometimes prolonged downturns.\u201dIn the first seven months of 2015, American companies exported more than $65 billion worth of products to China, making it the third-largest destination for American-made goods after Canada and Mexico. The United States runs a substantial trade deficit with China \u2014 imports here totaled nearly $268 billion over the same period \u2014 but exports to China rose by 34 percent between 2010 and 2014.The uncertain outlook for growth in Asia and in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa is not a worry just for corporate executives or investors on Wall Street. Last week, the Federal Reserve held off on raising short-term interest rates, citing global economic conditions as a principal concern.\u201cIn the near term, there are clearly risks in terms of China\u2019s growth rate,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a business information firm. \u201cBut this is the second-largest economy in the world now, so even if they grow by 6 percent, that\u2019s a much bigger contribution to global growth than when they were smaller and grew by 10 percent a decade ago.\u201d\u201cThey are struggling right now,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the future in terms of growth is with China and the emerging world.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors\u2019 Fears on Commodities Add to Pressure on Share Prices", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks & BondsStocks fell sharply on Monday as investors added new fears to the list of concerns that have weighed on global markets in recent weeks.In addition to worrying about the world\u2019s largest economies, investors are now grappling with problems facing some of the world\u2019s most prominent companies. On Monday, a nearly 30 percent decline in the shares of Glencore, a large Swiss mining and trading firm hit hard by the plunge in commodities prices, sent fear through the markets.\u201cThey are one of the victims of the commodities decline \u2014 a very big one and very high-profile one,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a co-founder of the Solaris Group. \u201cIt\u2019s all related to global growth.\u201dAt the same time, investors are trying to assess the impact of the Volkswagen emissions-testing scandal on the broader auto sector and determine the outlook for biotechnology companies, which have sold off in recent days as politicians expressed their frustration with increases in drug prices.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index plunged 49.57 points, or 2.57 percent, to close at 1,881.77. The benchmark is now only marginally above the low that it sank to in August, when heavy turbulence interrupted a long ascent for United States stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 312.78 points, or 1.92 percent, to 16,001.89. The sell-off in biotech shares battered the Nasdaq index, which was down 142.53 points, more than 3 percent, to 4,543.97. European shares, as measured by the Stoxx Europe 600 index, fell 2.21 percent. The sell-off continued Tuesday in Asia at the start of trading, with the Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping more than 3 percent, and the main index in Shanghai falling 1.5 percent. The nervousness showed up in other indicators. The Vix index, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked nearly 17 percent on Monday. Investors sought the relative safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.10 percent on Monday after closing at 2.17 percent on Friday.\u201cThe action since late August has been pretty poor,\u201d said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, a brokerage. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are many people who are pretty excited about stocks right now.\u201dThe S.& P. 500 index is now down nearly 12 percent from the benchmark nominal high it reached in May. A market that is down more than 10 percent from a peak is said to be in correction, in Wall Street parlance. A decline of 20 percent or more is a bear market. The last bear market in United States stocks ended in 2009.Much of the recent weakness in the markets can be attributed to concerns about the strength of the global economy. China\u2019s economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, appears to be slowing. China\u2019s sluggishness could lead to slower growth in other countries, and its decision to allow its currency to trade more freely appears to have prompted China\u2019s trading rivals to devalue their currencies to gain an advantage in global export markets. On Monday, new data showed that industrial profits in China declined by almost 9 percent in August from a year earlier.Now, though, problems within big companies are adding to the bearishness on the economy.In the case of Glencore, the challenges are directly related to weakness in the global economy and commodities markets. Glencore\u2019s shares are now down nearly 90 percent from the price at which they went public in 2011. Trading firms like Glencore depend on constant access to cheap credit to finance their bets. But creditors may cut back their loans to a trading firm if its prospects appear to be dimming. Glencore has recently taken steps that aim to strengthen its balance sheet, like reducing debt and selling new shares, but the continued decline in its shares suggests that investors may think the company has to do more. Glencore declined to comment.The ire among some politicians toward drug companies appears to be spreading. On Monday, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform pressed the panel\u2019s chairman to subpoena Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a Canadian drug maker, to obtain documents relating to the increase in the price of two of its drugs. Valeant\u2019s shares fell nearly 17 percent, to $166.50.\u201cIt\u2019s not all terrible \u2014 look at Nike,\u201d said Mr. Greenhaus. \u201cHopefully, over the next few weeks we\u2019ll see more of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greenlight Capital Down 14% for Year; David Einhorn Surveys Investors", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDavid Einhorn has earned a reputation as one of the savviest stock pickers on Wall Street. But the recent market turmoil has not spared him, and this year is shaping up to be one of the worst in his big hedge fund firm\u2019s two-decade history.Now, Mr. Einhorn wants to know what his investors think about his hedge fund, the nearly $11 billion Greenlight Capital.The fund was down 5.3 percent in August and down 14 percent for the year, according to people briefed on the matter.Going into August, Greenlight had been down 9 percent, performing much worse than the average hedge fund, which as of the end of July was up 2.5 percent for the year, according to the research firm HFR.Earlier this year, Mr. Einhorn\u2019s firm retained an outside consulting firm to conduct a survey of investors, which included more than 100 questions, to gauge their thoughts about the hedge fund and its accessibility with investors, said people briefed on the matter.The outside firm began contacting some of Greenlight\u2019s 700 investors several weeks ago to conduct phone interviews that lasted about 30 minutes each.It is not clear what Mr. Einhorn, 46, intends to do with the results of the survey, which he has conducted from time to time.A person briefed on the matter said that the timing of the survey had nothing to do with the fund\u2019s recent performance. Still, it is an indication of how hedge fund managers, even famous ones like Mr. Einhorn, need to be sensitive to what their investors are thinking.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed about the recent results,\u201d Greenlight said in a note on Monday, adding that it had pared back its positions.Questions are increasingly being raised by public pension funds and others about whether hedge funds are worth the hefty fees they charge, given that many big funds are underperforming.August was a torrid month for hedge funds, and other prominent hedge fund managers have disclosed bets that have turned sour. Many funds were crowded in the same stocks that were hammered by the rapid sell-off last week.Leon G. Cooperman, founder of the $9 billion Omega Advisors, told investors on Aug. 21 that he was down 11 percent for the month. Last week, William A. Ackman surprised investors by announcing that all the gains for his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund for the year had been wiped out by \u201csignificant volatility\u201d in the global markets. Mr. Ackman\u2019s multibillion-dollar hedge fund was down 7.3 percent for the quarter and 4.3 percent for the year as of Aug. 25.The world\u2019s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Raymond Dalio, told investors that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.77 percent as of Aug. 21. And the flagship fund of Third Point, led by Daniel S. Loeb, is up just 0.6 percent for the year, after losing 5.1 percent in August.For Mr. Einhorn, this year has been one of bad timing and wrong calls. In July, Mr. Einhorn called his investment in SunEdison \u201cour only significant winner,\u201d adding that the stock had gone from $24 a share to $29.91 a share over the quarter. But in August, the stock took a sharp dive and is now trading at $10.40 a share.Mr. Einhorn also bet heavily on the chip maker Micron Technology, increasing his stake in the company over the second quarter, according to the latest 13F filings.Even so, he told investors in July that it was \u201cour biggest loser\u201d in the quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s a cyclical business and, regrettably, we missed the turn of the cycle,\u201d he told investors in a letter in July.Along with gold, General Motors and Apple rank among his biggest long positions, both of which have had uneven returns in recent months. His fund has held a small position in Greek bank stocks and warrants. \u201cGreece has been anything but sun-kissed,\u201d Mr. Einhorn wrote in his July letter.\u201cIf you look at the market, it isn\u2019t pricing risk in the way it should be, and it\u2019s very difficult to get things right,\u201d Mr. Taback said.Still, some investors speculated that Mr. Einhorn might be managing too much money and that his firm is not as nimble as it once was, making it more difficult to exit losing positions.In the hedge fund industry, Mr. Einhorn has developed a reputation for accurately identifying stocks that will plunge in price and sectors that will be hit. Earlier this year, he announced that he was broadly shorting oil drillers and fracking companies, including Pioneer Natural Resources. With energy prices plummeting in August, his bet against much of the oil sector most likely helped minimize his firm\u2019s losses. But the coal producer Consol Energy, another of his biggest positions, ended the month roughly flat.Mr. Einhorn, who started his firm in 1996 with $1 million that was invested by family and friends, may be most famous for his 2008 presentation questioning the finances of Lehman Brothers, several months before the investment bank collapsed in the financial crisis. But not even Lehman\u2019s failure could prevent a roughly 23 percent loss for the firm that year, a bleak time for many hedge funds.And Mr. Einhorn\u2019s bets against companies have not always been well timed. In 2011, Mr. Einhorn took a short position against Keurig Green Mountain, at the time a Wall Street darling, questioning the coffee company\u2019s ability to grow in a competitive market. Last November, Mr. Einhorn told his investors he had settled his wager at a loss after the stock continued to surge. Greenlight bought shares in the company for an average price of $47.59 a share and covered the bet at an average of $67.02.The stock hit its peak soon after and has lost its momentum since. So far this year, the stock is down 59 percent. It closed on Monday at $56.60 a share.The poor results this year come after Mr. Einhorn opened the doors of his firm to new investors, raising money for the first time in years. Last summer, the hedge fund consulting firm Cliffwater was one of several consulting firms that recommended institutional investors commit new money to Greenlight.One concern for Greenlight is that if the difficult year continues, the firm may be hit with redemption requests from investors. If too many investors were to ask for their money back, it could force the firm to sell stocks to raise cash.Greenlight\u2019s investors include wealthy individuals and institutions, such as pension funds and other investments funds. In its report last year, Cliffwater estimated that 20 to 25 percent of Greenlight\u2019s investors come from so-called funds of hedge funds, investment vehicles that invest in a number of hedge funds.Roughly 15 percent of the outside capital managed by Greenlight comes from Greenlight Re, the Bermuda-based reinsurance firm that Mr. Einhorn and Greenlight took public in 2007.At the moment, the threat of redemptions does not appear to be pressing. A number of Greenlight\u2019s investors say that while this year\u2019s performance is troubling, the broader economic environment has made it particularly hard for stock pickers like Mr. Einhorn to make money.Saying that Mr. Einhorn\u2019s \u201coverall record has been good,\u201d Bill Latimer, whose charitable foundation is invested with Greenlight, said he was not looking to redeem any money.Other investors are willing to give Mr. Einhorn the benefit of the doubt, noting that the firm has generated an annualized return of just over 19 percent since it opened for business in 1996.In his most recent note to investors, Mr. Einhorn made an appeal to investors to sit tight, signing off with a quote from the inventor Thomas A. Edison.\u201cA diamond is a piece of coal that stuck to the job,\u201d Mr. Einhorn wrote.An article on Tuesday about the lagging returns of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital misstated what the fund told its investors on Monday about its positions. The firm said it had pared back its positions, not that it was planning to do so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some Hedge Funds Prosper in Market Tumult", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA market sell-off that ricocheted across the globe last month reversed the fortunes of many of Wall Street\u2019s star investors. But it is not all doom and gloom in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.A number of hedge funds, both big and small, are recording double-digit gains this year and putting up the kind of performances that just might justify the industry\u2019s famously hefty fees.One is Jason Karp, whose Tourbillon Capital Partners, a $2.9 billion fund, is up 18.44 percent in its main portfolio, said a person briefed on the firm\u2019s performance. Mr. Karp, 38, who worked for Mr. Cohen for nearly four years, created Tourbillon in 2012.And he is not the only former SAC trader enjoying what has been a long, hot summer for hedge funds.Aaron Cowen\u2019s Suvretta Capital Management, a $2 billion hedge fund, is up 7 to 9 percent in its main funds, said a person briefed on that firm\u2019s performance. And Melvin Capital, a roughly $1 billion firm that Gabriel Plotkin founded last year, is up nearly 20 percent, said a person briefed on the matter.Mr. Cowen, 43, is a former chief investment officer at SAC and Mr. Plotkin, 36, once one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s top traders, started his firm with a $200 million investment from Mr. Cohen.All three former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are running classic long-short hedge funds that make both bullish and bearish bets on stocks. But they come from the SAC tradition of moving quickly in and out of stocks \u2014 a tactic that may be serving them well at time when the speed and unpredictability of the recent big swings in the markets may be unnerving other managers.That tactic can also be found at Israel Englander\u2019s Millennium Management, a $31.5 billion firm with a wide array of trading strategies. Some of its 170 portfolio teams trade stocks in the same kind of short-term trading fashion that SAC helped popularize during its heyday. Millennium is up 9.6 percent for the year, said two people briefed on the firm\u2019s performance.The most famous stock trader, Mr. Cohen, who is 59, now runs a more than $10 billion family office called Point72 Asset Management that manages mostly his own money. It is not clear how he has done with Point72, which remains an active force on Wall Street. A spokesman for Mr. Cohen declined to comment.In 2014, its first year of existence, Point72 generated a gross profit of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The firm prospered even after Mr. Cohen was forced by federal prosecutors to give back money to his outside investors in the wake of an insider trading investigation that led to SAC pleading guilty to securities fraud and paying $1.8 billion in fines and penalties to prosecutors and federal securities regulators.Firms that make trades off the turmoil have done especially well. For instance, Ionic Capital Management, a $2.5 billion hedge fund that performs best in volatile markets, is up about 16 percent for the year, after notching an 11 percent gain in August, said a person briefed on the numbers.These kinds of performances stand out in a year when the average hedge fund, as measured by the HFR Index, is down about 1 percent. In comparison, the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is off 5.3 percent for the year.Other hedge funds of varying investing strategies that are recording gains this year include Visium Asset Management\u2019s flagship fund, which is up 11.2 percent, Kerrisdale Capital, up 6.2 percent, and Renaissance Technologies\u2019 Renaissance Institutional Equities Funds or RIEF, which is up 3.32 percent, said several people briefed on the performance of those firms.Hedge funds with more concentrated positions and longer-term views have tended to fare the worst the past month and at other points this year.Hedge funds like Omega Partners, the $9 billion hedge fund founded by Leon Cooperman, have had disappointing performances, partly because they have increasingly abandoned short positions for long ones in a roaring bull market in the United States that had clobbered short-sellers. The firm is down 8 percent for the year, said a person briefed on the matter.David Einhorn\u2019s nearly $11 billion Greenlight Capital is one of the best-known underperformers, down 14 percent for the year.In recent years, investors have preferred to park their money with hedge funds that offer long-only funds, according to a recent report by Deutsche Bank. In this environment, even short-sellers \u2014 investors who take bets against the market \u2014 have had to change their strategies.Daniel S. Loeb, who manages about $17 billion and is best known for penning acerbic letters to corporate boards, also had a rough August. His Third Point flagship fund lost 5.1 percent in August, cutting its full year performance to a gain of 0.6 percent.Jana Partners, founded by the billionaire Barry Rosenstein, lost 4.3 percent in August and is up less than 1 percent for the year, according to a person briefed on the firm\u2019s performance.All three men are considered activist investors, a class of hedge fund manager that has been too focused on long positions, said Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management. \u201cThat works great in a bull market, but they aren\u2019t really hedged funds. Because they charge incentive fees people talk about them as hedge funds,\u201d he said.Speaking broadly of the fact that so many hedge funds have become focused on long stocks positions, Mr. Yusko said: \u201cLong only is long only. If people want to pay for stock-picking alpha with incentive fees, great. But people shouldn\u2019t expect them to protect capital in down markets.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the recent performance of some hedge fund firms gave an outdated figure for assets under management at one such firm, Millennium Management. Millennium says it has $31.5 billion of assets under management \u2014 not $27 billion, which was the figure the firm gave in a filing in March.Advertisement"}
